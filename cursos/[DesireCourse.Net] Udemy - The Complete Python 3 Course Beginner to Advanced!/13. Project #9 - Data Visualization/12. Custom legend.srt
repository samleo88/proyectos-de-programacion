1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,470
So we've got a functional chart now. If I run

2

00:00:04,470  -->  00:00:07,259
this you'll see that it has specific

3

00:00:07,259  -->  00:00:09,960
numbers, it's got colors, it's got bars,

4

00:00:09,960  -->  00:00:12,150
it's got everything we want, and it's even got

5

00:00:12,150  -->  00:00:13,980
a legend so that we can actually tell

6

00:00:13,980  -->  00:00:15,990
which one is which, which is good but

7

00:00:15,990  -->  00:00:17,820
this overlaps the chart, and so we're

8

00:00:17,820  -->  00:00:20,039
going to be talking in this video a bit

9

00:00:20,039  -->  00:00:21,960
about how to style this legend and how

10

00:00:21,960  -->  00:00:25,170
to move it around. So, for instance, you

11

00:00:25,170  -->  00:00:26,970
can change the edge color and the face

12

00:00:26,970  -->  00:00:30,570
color of this legend just by using those

13

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:32,940
arguments, keyword arguments. So I'm going

14

00:00:32,940  -->  00:00:39,480
to set the edge color to red so we can

15

00:00:39,480  -->  00:00:41,370
see it clear, and I'm going to set face

16

00:00:41,370  -->  00:00:47,520
color equal to a lighter red. I'm going

17

00:00:47,520  -->  00:00:49,230
to save this and run the application again,

18

00:00:49,230  -->  00:00:52,800
and you're going to see that what it has

19

00:00:52,800  -->  00:00:54,870
done is exactly what I told it to. It's

20

00:00:54,870  -->  00:00:58,230
changed the border color to red and then

21

00:00:58,230  -->  00:01:01,289
the internal color to to a lighter shade

22

00:01:01,289  -->  00:01:03,660
of red, but we don't want to do that. We

23

00:01:03,660  -->  00:01:11,250
want to set the edge color to none, and

24

00:01:11,250  -->  00:01:15,450
shadow to none, we want to set shadow as

25

00:01:15,450  -->  00:01:22,170
well. So shadow equals false. Now if we

26

00:01:22,170  -->  00:01:25,560
reset this, we still got the shadow it looks

27

00:01:25,560  -->  00:01:31,920
like. I'm going to remove face color

28

00:01:31,920  -->  00:01:34,430
here...

29

00:01:38,510  -->  00:01:40,850
it definitely still does have that

30

00:01:40,850  -->  00:01:44,180
shadow there. What we're going to do

31

00:01:44,180  -->  00:01:46,580
we're going to set the frame to none so

32

00:01:46,580  -->  00:01:48,380
basically you can turn on or off the

33

00:01:48,380  -->  00:01:50,810
frame, and the frame is basically the

34

00:01:50,810  -->  00:01:52,670
border of the background and the shadow.

35

00:01:52,670  -->  00:01:58,220
So if I set the keyword frameon to

36

00:01:58,220  -->  00:02:01,250
false, and then restart the application,

37

00:02:01,250  -->  00:02:04,010
you're going to see that now there's

38

00:02:04,010  -->  00:02:06,200
nothing behind it, which is alright

39

00:02:06,200  -->  00:02:08,810
except for the fact that it doesn't look

40

00:02:08,810  -->  00:02:11,570
right. So what we're going to do is

41

00:02:11,570  -->  00:02:13,340
we're now going to change the position

42

00:02:13,340  -->  00:02:16,040
to put it outside that corner, and how

43

00:02:16,040  -->  00:02:17,600
you're going to do that is using the

44

00:02:17,600  -->  00:02:21,920
lok, or the location keyword, and you're

45

00:02:21,920  -->  00:02:24,890
going to use a string or a tuple. So if I

46

00:02:24,890  -->  00:02:26,690
scroll down here you're going to see

47

00:02:26,690  -->  00:02:30,530
these are the codes that you can use. So

48

00:02:30,530  -->  00:02:35,120
you can set location equal to 3, 2, 1, etc.,

49

00:02:35,120  -->  00:02:41,450
and I'm going to set mine to 2, and this

50

00:02:41,450  -->  00:02:44,540
is going to put it outside of the actual

51

00:02:44,540  -->  00:02:47,540
chart, actually inside the actual chart,

52

00:02:47,540  -->  00:02:50,330
because what we also need to do is

53

00:02:50,330  -->  00:02:52,850
bboxed_to_anchor. This one's a little

54

00:02:52,850  -->  00:02:55,730
more complicated but basically it tells

55

00:02:55,730  -->  00:02:59,750
it where to anchor it to. So, bbox_

56

00:02:59,750  -->  00:03:02,930
to_anchor, mine is going to be equal to a

57

00:03:02,930  -->  00:03:05,360
tuple, and this is going to be 1, 1, and

58

00:03:05,360  -->  00:03:07,489
you're going to see that this

59

00:03:07,489  -->  00:03:10,459
combination now puts it outside the

60

00:03:10,459  -->  00:03:16,760
right hand side. So if we look at, where is that,

61

00:03:16,760  -->  00:03:19,700
bbox_to_anchor, so it's a box base

62

00:03:19,700  -->  00:03:23,480
instance. So, left, bottom, width, and height.

63

00:03:23,480  -->  00:03:25,940
So we're not worrying about width and

64

00:03:25,940  -->  00:03:27,260
height at this point, we're worrying about

65

00:03:27,260  -->  00:03:33,290
left and bottom which we're setting. So that's

66

00:03:33,290  -->  00:03:35,780
a little bit about how to modify the

67

00:03:35,780  -->  00:03:37,580
legend, and if you guys want to try out

68

00:03:37,580  -->  00:03:39,680
all of these keywords you definitely can.

69

00:03:39,680  -->  00:03:41,870
You can set the color, the font size, the

70

00:03:41,870  -->  00:03:44,630
marker, you know you can set all those,

71

00:03:44,630  -->  00:03:47,269
the border padding, etc. So, go ahead and

72

00:03:47,269  -->  00:03:48,530
experiment with that and we're going to

73

00:03:48,530  -->  00:03:49,780
be making this chart better

74

00:03:49,780  -->  00:03:52,680
in the next video as well.
