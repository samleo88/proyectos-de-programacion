WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:04.930
Know like I said for this section we're going to be actually using a carousel.

00:05.060 --> 00:05.300
Right.

00:05.310 --> 00:06.620
So where do we get this.

00:06.630 --> 00:12.110
And that's basically a Jake Weary plug in or here for this get.

00:12.300 --> 00:17.440
So we're going to go to Google and then we'll just write our curso once we can go on down there.

00:17.470 --> 00:17.840
Right.

00:17.890 --> 00:21.780
So this is going to be they are curso and right away with them just click download.

00:21.860 --> 00:22.510
All right.

00:22.560 --> 00:28.360
Because then we're going to get our zip folder right in order here when we want to do is let's say that

00:28.590 --> 00:30.080
not only we won them all.

00:30.210 --> 00:33.480
We're going to go to Dock's right here.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.180
Everything is very great.

00:36.180 --> 00:36.750
Explain.

00:36.850 --> 00:37.590
Right.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.100
Or here we're going to start with instillation.

00:40.190 --> 00:40.700
All right.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.420
And this is what they're asking.

00:42.480 --> 00:45.780
So we're asking our carrousel and men.

00:45.810 --> 00:49.260
Yes that's this theme here Mencius says.

00:49.530 --> 00:55.190
And the thing is you don't need to include the theme however it makes sense to include the theme the

00:55.200 --> 00:56.130
faulty assess.

00:56.140 --> 00:56.400
All right.

00:56.420 --> 00:57.200
This one.

00:57.210 --> 01:05.460
And it also makes sense to actually include over here when we write our curso actually include to our

01:05.560 --> 01:06.750
theme right.

01:06.780 --> 01:12.260
Remember if we had it over we're here in RHC and now I am over here.

01:12.480 --> 01:16.330
If we were going to scroll back here after all these numbers right.

01:16.470 --> 01:19.890
Remember it is our theme and this is what they want.

01:19.890 --> 01:20.300
All right.

01:20.460 --> 01:22.700
Because what they want is a day.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.220
Then all the contents over here.

01:25.330 --> 01:26.460
Right.

01:26.850 --> 01:31.260
And this is going to be the or so and here this is how we would call the plug.

01:31.350 --> 01:31.750
Right.

01:31.930 --> 01:34.140
We're actually going to look at the demos how to do that.

01:34.140 --> 01:34.630
Right.

01:34.710 --> 01:42.480
But the basic idea is that you would need a whole carousel men Janice and you would need these two CSSA

01:42.870 --> 01:43.430
right.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.380
So let's go ahead and let's actually do that.

01:45.420 --> 01:45.830
Right.

01:45.990 --> 01:52.830
So if I'm going to go to my downloads or like this and once all see or hear this is going to be the

01:52.830 --> 01:53.270
owl.

01:53.420 --> 01:53.890
Right.

01:54.170 --> 01:58.040
And we're going to get this Arcaro So we're going to open up this fall there.

01:58.330 --> 02:04.280
And now let's look at distribution first here and now we have all curves on men James.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.890
All right so I can just grab this file over here.

02:07.050 --> 02:10.740
Then we're going to go back here and look at sense.

02:10.890 --> 02:16.860
And so here we have all seen the fault see ISIS on here knowing this.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.220
And we also have our Kairo so yes.

02:20.280 --> 02:20.910
Yes.

02:21.040 --> 02:21.390
Right.

02:21.420 --> 02:29.760
So I'm going to grab these two here and all carrousel see SS or we can just grab them in here since

02:30.030 --> 02:30.900
it's really up to you.

02:30.930 --> 02:31.450
Right.

02:31.710 --> 02:36.440
And I was just double check right so now Carson some miniature sets and all theme.

02:36.470 --> 02:37.930
The fourth Mincy says.

02:38.070 --> 02:45.240
Now they're asking for men but because I want to do here little bit of upgrade here right I want to

02:45.240 --> 02:46.260
affect them right.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.500
That's why I'm choosing the regular one.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.040
Not many fine version.

02:50.040 --> 02:50.640
Right.

02:50.670 --> 02:56.400
So here what I'm going to do is I can just close this one right and I'm going to say new folder and

02:56.400 --> 02:58.420
I'm going to say oh oh.

02:59.050 --> 02:59.630
Right.

02:59.730 --> 03:04.240
And what I'm going to do or here I'm going to drag these three files or here.

03:04.260 --> 03:04.640
All right.

03:04.710 --> 03:06.600
All of them in there.

03:06.720 --> 03:16.280
So I'm going to place them in this folder on this I'm just going to grab this folder and actually place

03:16.280 --> 03:17.760
it on here also.

03:17.760 --> 03:20.160
All right so do the same thing here.

03:20.270 --> 03:25.180
Now I can see my Codemasters I have my owl or here a folder.

03:25.220 --> 03:25.710
Right.

03:25.940 --> 03:29.970
So if we're going to go back to the text center now we should have the folder.

03:30.260 --> 03:36.410
Now we can start over here by when we have Mangi access right manger.

03:36.430 --> 03:37.240
Yes.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.230
Before that we're going to say all.

03:39.540 --> 03:40.480
Yes.

03:40.790 --> 03:44.680
And where it is located we're going to say script like this.

03:44.840 --> 03:50.530
We're going to press time and then we're going to have a source or so here once we have the source to

03:50.560 --> 03:53.960
say how and when to look for all Menger Yes.

03:53.990 --> 03:54.530
All right.

03:54.530 --> 04:00.290
So now we have our javascript then what you would want is our C Ss right.

04:00.470 --> 04:04.990
So we're going to go all the way on the top right or here we're going to say this is going to be all

04:05.710 --> 04:07.220
all of us.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.040
All right.

04:08.060 --> 04:11.070
And what's going to happen is that we're going to have a link.

04:11.230 --> 04:11.820
All right.

04:11.950 --> 04:18.710
And we're going to say now then we're going to use a theme like this and then we're also going to have

04:18.740 --> 04:20.890
another one just for CSX.

04:20.930 --> 04:25.460
And so again now and this is going to be a Kairo so men reassess.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.100
All right.

04:26.180 --> 04:29.130
So we say this one or here right.

04:29.140 --> 04:31.710
Don't worry about whatever is happening right now.

04:31.730 --> 04:32.460
Right.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.890
We just haven't had any kind of cold to control this.

04:36.020 --> 04:36.560
Right.

04:36.650 --> 04:39.870
And now let's go ahead and let's actually see how we can work with that.

04:39.890 --> 04:40.450
Right.

04:40.520 --> 04:46.730
So we're going to go back when we're done with installation right here they're saying how to set up

04:46.730 --> 04:48.710
the on here IMHO.

04:48.740 --> 04:49.250
All right.

04:49.250 --> 04:55.310
And this is where they actually basically saying right that even though you don't need to include it

04:55.360 --> 04:55.880
right.

04:56.030 --> 05:00.580
The thing is if you do not included You're not going to have all these little icons.

05:00.610 --> 05:01.230
Right.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.740
So these ones are not going to be there.

05:02.750 --> 05:03.000
Right.

05:03.050 --> 05:05.380
If you do not include the whole thing.

05:05.510 --> 05:08.450
So make sure if you one that you need to include the whole thing.

05:08.780 --> 05:11.750
And like I said we're going to actually go to them all right away.

05:11.750 --> 05:12.690
Right.

05:12.830 --> 05:16.510
Because what I want to do is quickly show you how it works right.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.160
So here would be all the options that we would want.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.770
Right right right basic demos right.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.190
And we're going to go with a basic one right and then right away shows you what we have.

05:25.220 --> 05:25.630
Right.

05:25.820 --> 05:27.860
So this will be our basic Carrousel.

05:27.860 --> 05:31.390
So what we would need actually or here we would need over here.

05:31.400 --> 05:36.720
We're going to use a selector right and you can see that it is a Jake where we plug in so it uses J.A.G.

05:36.890 --> 05:42.190
So it's the same dollar sign on here and we would just ask ourselves how we would do it.

05:42.200 --> 05:42.870
Right.

05:42.920 --> 05:48.650
So what I'm going to say here is I'm just going to copy and paste this on here and I'm going to go to

05:48.650 --> 05:52.770
my script file and I'm going to go script over here.

05:52.940 --> 05:58.180
And if this was the smooth scroll right on the smooth curl I'm going to say oh I'm not saying we're

05:58.190 --> 06:02.690
going to say team right because this is going to be for team and all here.

06:02.750 --> 06:09.170
What I would want is I'm going to use a different one right now not just Alcaraz so I'm going to go

06:09.170 --> 06:17.390
back over here to the next and I'm going to make sure that I know what is the name or hear of my div.

06:17.390 --> 06:17.880
Right.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.560
So here remember this class theme center.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.940
Just make sure that you have both of these.

06:22.940 --> 06:26.880
All right I'll carrousel and Altham and then over here you see this class.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.520
This is how we're going to be targeting.

06:28.730 --> 06:33.470
So I'm going to say we're here and this is going to be all team Center.

06:33.470 --> 06:33.770
All right.

06:33.830 --> 06:38.710
So here I'm going to say I want to select team center out here.

06:38.720 --> 06:39.320
Right.

06:39.450 --> 06:41.560
So this refresh it.

06:41.690 --> 06:44.110
Now I can see Sure enough in my hour or so.

06:44.120 --> 06:44.700
Right.

06:44.720 --> 06:45.920
This is how easy it is.

06:45.920 --> 06:46.660
Right.

06:46.700 --> 06:50.910
And like I said we're here this these are the options.

06:50.980 --> 06:51.510
Right.

06:51.530 --> 06:52.850
And where do you see the options.

06:52.850 --> 07:00.170
Right so basically you're saying I going to select this have an all its children within an hour or so.

07:00.170 --> 07:00.640
Right.

07:00.860 --> 07:04.540
And then these are going to be properties and these are the values.

07:04.640 --> 07:10.560
So I'm going to go back over here and go back to docs and are here now.

07:10.580 --> 07:11.980
This is the API.

07:12.020 --> 07:12.430
Right.

07:12.650 --> 07:14.190
And these are the options right.

07:14.210 --> 07:20.280
So we start like items type number right to a default 3 right margin right.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.680
And we're just go one by one.

07:21.680 --> 07:25.730
Now I'm not going to be covering them all right especially all of them right.

07:25.970 --> 07:31.430
But you can see where you can get the properties down where you have values and obviously some of them

07:31.430 --> 07:32.530
right away have default.

07:32.540 --> 07:37.170
Right now the only one we're going to look at here is going to be the smart speed.

07:37.400 --> 07:37.920
Right.

07:37.940 --> 07:44.340
This is pretty much how long it takes for our curve so right the slide to actually move across the screen.

07:44.510 --> 07:46.220
See or hear the smart speed.

07:46.250 --> 07:52.050
So we're going to go back over here and we're going right over here marked speed and here let's say

07:52.060 --> 07:59.330
like four thousand nine again four seconds basically let's say if this does this we're going to refresh

07:59.810 --> 08:01.400
and see what happens right.

08:01.560 --> 08:05.850
So it takes four seconds to move across the screen and I can see her right away.

08:05.850 --> 08:08.820
And this is a responsive 4 0.

08:09.040 --> 08:09.310
Right.

08:09.320 --> 08:16.760
This is going to be one element then 600 pixels right this is three then this is five.

08:16.980 --> 08:21.540
Obviously you can change these values right and you'll see or hear on the next one.

08:21.540 --> 08:21.810
All right.

08:21.810 --> 08:24.750
We're actually going to change it to say three right.

08:24.780 --> 08:27.270
So here you can see where we're going to be only using three.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.480
Even though the screen size is the same right.

08:29.700 --> 08:34.110
Let's just go here and refresh Now let's see what we have right.

08:34.110 --> 08:37.770
Sure enough we have five of them right here like this.

08:37.770 --> 08:44.750
Now let's go ahead and let's actually work on what would be the values on here like this right.

08:44.850 --> 08:47.600
Because you are hearing this looks differently.

08:47.610 --> 08:47.880
Right.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.970
So we have different colors over here.

08:50.010 --> 08:55.200
So what we're going to do here this is we do that in our theme.

08:55.290 --> 08:59.230
All right so script stays the same the way it is going to go.

08:59.250 --> 09:02.070
Now we're going to roll out the in the fold.

09:02.290 --> 09:02.990
Right.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.420
And you can see all all theme old Nav..

09:05.520 --> 09:06.160
Right.

09:06.180 --> 09:08.450
And then you start working on them right.

09:08.490 --> 09:12.660
So now I can see that this is going to be the background this is going to be the let's say color right

09:12.950 --> 09:13.280
hand.

09:13.380 --> 09:15.720
Here now where are working with the dots right.

09:16.140 --> 09:18.750
So here what we're going to say for the background.

09:18.870 --> 09:24.540
And like I said 1 9 1 9 1 9 right then we're here for the color.

09:24.540 --> 09:31.080
Let's say that we're going to say EF 5 and 3 or 5 really like this then we're here.

09:31.170 --> 09:34.010
You can see that we're going to have some hovering effect.

09:34.290 --> 09:35.170
All right.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.660
So this one was the actual color.

09:37.760 --> 09:38.120
Right.

09:38.140 --> 09:42.900
And let's say also right so I have five three or five.

09:43.170 --> 09:44.550
So this is the caller.

09:44.550 --> 09:46.180
Now this is for hovering.

09:46.180 --> 09:49.390
All right and for the hovering let's do a blue one.

09:49.400 --> 09:54.960
All right so let's go back to main assess Let's find where is the blue color.

09:54.990 --> 10:00.470
And we use that in the bottom so I can definitely get it over here right.

10:00.480 --> 10:05.640
So you just copy and paste this on your copy.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.970
And I'm going to go back to all three.

10:08.340 --> 10:11.190
And we're going to just copy and paste this on here.

10:11.220 --> 10:12.840
Now I am hovering.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.630
This is going to look like this right here.

10:15.730 --> 10:17.890
And now let's work with the dots right.

10:17.940 --> 10:25.080
And what I'm going to say again by default our 1 dots to be actually blank right away as I'm hovering

10:25.080 --> 10:26.340
they are going to be different.

10:26.460 --> 10:31.740
So I'm going to say 1 9 1 9 1 9 0 black and then we're going to have a live one.

10:31.750 --> 10:32.250
All right.

10:32.460 --> 10:34.820
Copy and paste this in this.

10:34.860 --> 10:39.830
Now I can see that as I'm going to be hovering right the actual dots are going to be changing like this

10:39.840 --> 10:40.320
right.

10:40.350 --> 10:46.710
So if you want any kind of customization you would need to work with all find fault or here like this.

10:46.720 --> 10:46.950
Right.

10:46.950 --> 10:49.520
So this is how that one works.

10:49.680 --> 10:59.340
And then here again let's go over right and script what we needed is a select on here and esteemed center.

10:59.460 --> 11:05.400
And the reason why we're using different names because we're going to have to our conversos right here

11:05.410 --> 11:07.140
we're going to have a second one.

11:07.140 --> 11:11.780
So if we're going to be selecting by the same one both of them are going to be affected.

11:11.780 --> 11:12.130
