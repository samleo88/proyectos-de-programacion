1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,190
Alright, what we're gonna do now is

2

00:00:02,190  -->  00:00:06,540
change the enemy's hitpoint readout

3

00:00:06,540  -->  00:00:08,880
which is going to be something to this, but a

4

00:00:08,880  -->  00:00:11,580
little bit different. So, let's go ahead

5

00:00:11,580  -->  00:00:16,920
and create a function within the class

6

00:00:16,920  -->  00:00:25,140
person. It's going to be get_enemy_stats. So,

7

00:00:25,140  -->  00:00:28,619
we can run this method on enemies and

8

00:00:28,619  -->  00:00:30,179
it's going to print it out like this. So,

9

00:00:30,179  -->  00:00:35,130
HP bar is going to be equal to nothing,

10

00:00:35,130  -->  00:00:41,190
and then bar_ticks is going to be equal to (self.hp

11

00:00:41,190  -->  00:00:48,930
/self.maxhp) * 100 / 2

12

00:00:48,930  -->  00:00:53,489
So, instead of having a 25 character

13

00:00:53,489  -->  00:00:55,379
progress bar it's going to have a 50

14

00:00:55,379  -->  00:00:57,449
character, so it's going to go from here

15

00:00:57,449  -->  00:01:03,420
to about here. Now, what we're going to do

16

00:01:03,420  -->  00:01:06,240
is the same thing as down here actually,

17

00:01:06,240  -->  00:01:15,930
while bar_ticks &gt; 0: hp_bar += " "

18

00:01:15,930  -->  00:01:20,490
and we're going to copy that

19

00:01:20,490  -->  00:01:26,490
character right there, and then bar_ticks

20

00:01:26,490  -->  00:01:34,530
-= 1. And that's enough to,

21

00:01:34,530  -->  00:01:40,170
alright we need to do while length more

22

00:01:40,170  -->  00:01:43,770
than 25, or less than 25. While

23

00:01:43,770  -->  00:01:51,720
length of the HP bar is less than 50, set

24

00:01:51,720  -->  00:01:57,450
hp_bar += " " What I'm

25

00:01:57,450  -->  00:02:01,829
going to do is copy this right here,

26

00:02:01,829  -->  00:02:05,369
I'm going to remove some from it, we're not going to print

27

00:02:05,369  -->  00:02:09,069
out the magic points of the enemy.

28

00:02:09,069  -->  00:02:15,639
We will print out the current HP and

29

00:02:15,639  -->  00:02:16,629
everything too, so

30

00:02:16,629  -->  00:02:18,040
we're going to be copying and pasting

31

00:02:18,040  -->  00:02:28,810
that bit of code as well. So, I'm going to remove that so

32

00:02:28,810  -->  00:02:33,280
that it just ends at the hit point bar, and print hit point bar there.

33

00:02:33,280  -->  00:02:38,530
So, what I'm going to do now is copy this

34

00:02:38,530  -->  00:02:42,579
bit of code right here and paste it here,

35

00:02:42,579  -->  00:02:45,219
it's just where it you know adds whitespace

36

00:02:45,219  -->  00:02:48,129
to the beginning of the the hip points

37

00:02:48,129  -->  00:02:52,449
there. So, if I save this, come back here,

38

00:02:52,449  -->  00:02:54,489
what I should be able to do is for

39

00:02:54,489  -->  00:02:58,989
player and players print get stats,

40

00:02:58,989  -->  00:03:01,659
but then after that also I want to

41

00:03:01,659  -->  00:03:09,040
print or I want to run enemy_get enemy_stats.

42

00:03:09,040  -->  00:03:13,989
Let me save it.

43

00:03:13,989  -->  00:03:19,299
What I'll see here, right this is a bit

44

00:03:19,299  -->  00:03:23,590
longer than 9

45

00:03:23,590  -->  00:03:28,629
characters it's 11, so I need to change

46

00:03:28,629  -->  00:03:33,729
that 9 here to 11. Then I need to move this

47

00:03:33,729  -->  00:03:40,359
one space in, and I need to add a bunch to

48

00:03:40,359  -->  00:03:45,849
it. So, let's see how many I have to add

49

00:03:45,849  -->  00:03:56,850
into it. So, 1, 2...oh, that's as far as it goes. Let's try

50

00:03:56,850  -->  00:04:03,690
10. Let's try 13, actually. There we go two more.

51

00:04:03,690  -->  00:04:07,650
There we go.

52

00:04:07,650  -->  00:04:13,410
So, that's all good let me remove some

53

00:04:13,410  -->  00:04:18,209
spaces here from in front of the name, or

54

00:04:18,209  -->  00:04:25,080
after the name, and let's add another space.

55

00:04:25,080  -->  00:04:27,810
I'm trying to get it to line up exactly with

56

00:04:27,810  -->  00:04:32,190
those rows and that works. So, I will remove one

57

00:04:32,190  -->  00:04:36,330
from there, should be good to go,

58

00:04:36,330  -->  00:04:45,720
one from the front. There we go.

59

00:04:45,720  -->  00:04:50,190
Alright, so, at this point what we're

60

00:04:50,190  -->  00:04:51,960
going to do is we're going to make this

61

00:04:51,960  -->  00:05:02,520
red.

62

00:05:02,520  -->  00:05:06,509
That is easily distinguishable from ours.

63

00:05:06,509  -->  00:05:15,150
It's fine. So, let's go ahead and

64

00:05:15,150  -->  00:05:17,159
make sure that this actually works. Let's

65

00:05:17,159  -->  00:05:19,770
start attacking you can see his hit

66

00:05:19,770  -->  00:05:22,530
points are going down. We're gonna cast,

67

00:05:22,530  -->  00:05:27,840
we're making progress,

68

00:05:27,840  -->  00:05:31,289
we gotta heal by using the elixirs...

69

00:05:31,289  -->  00:05:36,750
So,

70

00:05:36,750  -->  00:05:38,639
what we got to do at this point we've

71

00:05:38,639  -->  00:05:40,470
got to make a mega elixir effect

72

00:05:40,470  -->  00:05:43,740
everybody, so let's go into our main here

73

00:05:43,740  -->  00:06:06,680
and elixir. So,

74

00:06:06,680  -->  00:06:09,139
where i in players we're going to do

75

00:06:09,139  -->  00:06:22,610
this. We're going to go...

76

00:06:22,610  -->  00:06:29,449
so a mega elixir will do that, and a

77

00:06:29,449  -->  00:06:32,000
regular elixir will only heal the

78

00:06:32,000  -->  00:06:35,659
player. Well that's all good and fine but

79

00:06:35,659  -->  00:06:38,060
right now the enemy does not attack

80

00:06:38,060  -->  00:06:43,219
multiple people. So, what we need to do is

81

00:06:43,219  -->  00:06:46,610
generate a random number between 0 - 2

82

00:06:46,610  -->  00:06:53,990
for the enemy. So, how we're going to do

83

00:06:53,990  -->  00:06:56,810
that is, and also the enemy's only

84

00:06:56,810  -->  00:06:58,580
attacking, so what we need to do is

85

00:06:58,580  -->  00:07:02,180
create an enemy target. So, target is

86

00:07:02,180  -->  00:07:06,409
going to be equal to random, I need to

87

00:07:06,409  -->  00:07:21,409
import random here, random.randrange(0, 2)

88

00:07:21,409  -->  00:07:32,580
and then there

89

00:07:32,580  -->  00:07:36,870
players. This is going to target the array or

90

00:07:36,870  -->  00:07:38,400
the list, and this is going to tell it

91

00:07:38,400  -->  00:07:41,849
which list we want based on 0, 1, or 2.

92

00:07:41,849  -->  00:07:44,159
So, let's go ahead and start this again and

93

00:07:44,159  -->  00:07:45,629
let's make sure that he's actually

94

00:07:45,629  -->  00:07:48,509
attacking multiple people. So he attacked

95

00:07:48,509  -->  00:07:51,030
the middle character there, and then the first

96

00:07:51,030  -->  00:07:52,500
character,

97

00:07:52,500  -->  00:08:02,129
there we go. It still hasn't chosen 2, maybe

98

00:08:02,129  -->  00:08:15,940
I should make this 3. So, it won't...

99

00:08:15,940  -->  00:08:19,900
there we go. So, now that will select

100

00:08:19,900  -->  00:08:22,240
0, 1, or 2 but it will not

101

00:08:22,240  -->  00:08:23,770
select 3.

102

00:08:23,770  -->  00:08:28,180
Alright, we're also going to need to give

103

00:08:28,180  -->  00:08:30,310
it some magic, give it some items, and then do

104

00:08:30,310  -->  00:08:31,900
different things with that which we're

105

00:08:31,900  -->  00:08:34,180
not going to do in this video. What we

106

00:08:34,180  -->  00:08:36,250
are going to do is remove down here

107

00:08:36,250  -->  00:08:52,910
where it says enemy HP.

108

00:08:52,910  -->  00:08:54,500
We're also going to have to do other things to clean

109

00:08:54,500  -->  00:08:56,420
this up, but that is fine for now. We've

110

00:08:56,420  -->  00:08:58,970
got a big graphical display of everyone's hit

111

00:08:58,970  -->  00:09:05,020
points up at the top there.
