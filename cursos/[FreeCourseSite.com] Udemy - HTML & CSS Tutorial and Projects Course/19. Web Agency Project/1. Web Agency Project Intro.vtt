00:00.120 --> 00:01.470
What is going on guys.

00:01.470 --> 00:08.400
And welcome to web agency project and this project we're going to be building a responsive web agency

00:08.400 --> 00:09.210
Web site.

00:09.300 --> 00:12.570
But this project is going to be interesting for two main reasons.

00:12.570 --> 00:16.070
First we're not going to be using any kind of CSSA framework.

00:16.070 --> 00:16.410
All right.

00:16.410 --> 00:22.050
So something like bootstrap or anything like that and everything is going to get done with HD and now

00:22.250 --> 00:24.160
had a lot a lot of success.

00:24.360 --> 00:30.030
Now the second one for the lay out we're not going to be using any kind of CSSA floats or any kind of

00:30.030 --> 00:31.280
CIRCE's hacks.

00:31.290 --> 00:36.970
We're actually going to get done by using siestas grid and CSSA fluxbox rent.

00:36.990 --> 00:41.430
So this is going to be good training for us to get to know them right now what we're all going to be

00:41.430 --> 00:42.570
building on here.

00:42.580 --> 00:44.930
You can see that this is going to be power now.

00:44.970 --> 00:45.260
Right.

00:45.270 --> 00:47.430
And like I said this is going to be responsive.

00:47.430 --> 00:50.880
So if I'm going to be making a screen smaller.

00:50.910 --> 00:55.650
Right so this will be a member of your own here you can see the Door number is going to be over here.

00:55.740 --> 01:00.840
Now this button is not going to be working fine awesome because obviously we're not going to be using

01:00.840 --> 01:01.800
javascript.

01:01.830 --> 01:08.310
It's only going to be HD MLC Asus and Fonte are some and we're going to be using and over here if I

01:08.310 --> 01:12.230
make the screen bigger you can see how our bar is actually wrapping.

01:12.230 --> 01:19.120
Right so we're going to be using a flex box wrap property then we're going to be creating a banner.

01:19.130 --> 01:19.630
All right.

01:19.680 --> 01:24.250
So this is going to be our having one and we're going to have two buttons right as we're hovering.

01:24.340 --> 01:27.220
Then the next section is going to be our skills section right.

01:27.330 --> 01:31.290
And you can see that it's going to look exactly like we will be using bootstrap right.

01:31.290 --> 01:37.460
So again if I'm going to make the screens more now I can see the changes to the two columns that are

01:37.470 --> 01:37.950
here.

01:37.950 --> 01:40.410
This is going to change to actually single column right.

01:40.650 --> 01:41.440
And you can see that.

01:41.460 --> 01:42.830
Again this is going to be fun.

01:42.990 --> 01:44.460
This is going to be hitting one.

01:44.490 --> 01:45.890
And this is going to be parallel.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.630
So again I'm going to make the screen bigger and we're going to check out the next section that we're

01:50.640 --> 01:51.700
going to be creating.

01:51.780 --> 01:55.740
So the next section we're going to be creating is going to be services section right.

01:55.770 --> 02:00.180
And again for the whole way out there is going to be CIRCE's grid in use right.

02:00.210 --> 02:03.650
And are we going to achieve this effect by using CSSA right.

02:03.650 --> 02:08.400
So as you can see as I'm hovering actually text is changing right there's going to be some background

02:08.400 --> 02:12.610
text and the text that it's up front is actually moving up right now.

02:12.630 --> 02:17.100
What we're also going to be doing on here is you can see as I'm changing right it's going to be hard

02:17.100 --> 02:22.850
to see right now but ancho are going to change the order of these let's say boxes right.

02:22.860 --> 02:27.260
So we have four boxes and actually on a bigger screen the actual order is different.

02:27.270 --> 02:33.870
Right so we're going to you can look at C Ss and order properly right then we're going to have a project

02:33.870 --> 02:34.810
section right.

02:34.930 --> 02:40.350
Logan and just look at how to actually zoom in right would see this or here you can see that we're going

02:40.350 --> 02:42.020
to have in the background right.

02:42.020 --> 02:46.980
So we're going to have a foot or so here and this is going to be let's say our main section right.

02:47.070 --> 02:48.010
Our title.

02:48.010 --> 02:50.740
And again if I make it bigger there's going to be three of them right.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.630
Three project sections right.

02:52.740 --> 02:58.020
And over here if I'm going to make it to the smaller one again we're going to go to the two columns

02:58.140 --> 03:03.830
and then once we actually hit the small screen right we're going to have only a single column here.

03:03.840 --> 03:04.360
Right.

03:04.380 --> 03:07.090
And then after that we're we're going to be doing all right.

03:07.110 --> 03:10.700
We have a or here this little filler section right.

03:10.830 --> 03:14.910
Again we're going to be using a CSSA flex box in order to get this effect right.

03:14.910 --> 03:16.400
So they're side by side.

03:16.480 --> 03:20.870
And again if I make it in the smaller screen actually what's going to happen they are going to wrap

03:20.980 --> 03:21.400
around.

03:21.540 --> 03:26.310
So as you can see one the moment they hit each other actually this will wraps underneath the second

03:26.310 --> 03:27.270
one right.

03:27.370 --> 03:30.000
Going to have a recent post section right.

03:30.010 --> 03:33.490
Rhodes is going to be using a very very basic CSSA right.

03:33.510 --> 03:36.440
We're going to have this Fantasma appear out of nowhere.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.320
But this is we're going to be working with the cards right.

03:39.330 --> 03:45.480
So you can see that we're going to using We're going to use the SS actually make this card look like

03:45.480 --> 03:46.280
effect right.

03:46.290 --> 03:49.810
And again this is not bootstrap this is just pure success right.

03:49.830 --> 03:53.540
And the last hour here is going to be a first session right.

03:53.550 --> 03:57.320
Rose is going to mess around a little bit with these phantasm Mike on the right.

03:57.330 --> 03:59.110
So enough of me yapping.

03:59.130 --> 04:01.850
Let's go to coding and let's start creating this project.
