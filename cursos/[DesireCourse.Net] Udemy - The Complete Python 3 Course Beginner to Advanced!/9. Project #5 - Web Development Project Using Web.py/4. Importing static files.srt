00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:05,130
Hey guys, welcome back. In the last video
we learned how to setup our project as a

2

00:00:05,130  -->  00:00:11,460
model view controller structure, in that
video also I put the static files in the

3

00:00:11,460  -->  00:00:15,660
wrong location. So what you got to do is
you've got them under views and then

4

00:00:15,660  -->  00:00:21,840
resources, I want you to move the css
fonts and JavaScript into a top level

5

00:00:21,840  -->  00:00:28,560
directory called static, so that the
absolute path should be static/css/

6

00:00:28,560  -->  00:00:33,329
and then whatever file names are. Now
once you've got that done we're going to

7

00:00:33,329  -->  00:00:39,780
be talking about reusability and not
duplicating efforts. So what that means

8

00:00:39,780  -->  00:00:45,750
basically is if you are writing a static
HTML page and all the pages had the same

9

00:00:45,750  -->  00:00:51,899
header bar or nav bar, you'd have to
copy and paste them into each file,

10

00:00:51,899  -->  00:00:56,070
unless you're using like PHP includes,
but again if you're just using static

11

00:00:56,070  -->  00:00:57,210
HTML

12

00:00:57,210  -->  00:01:01,079
it's gonna, you're gonna have to redo a
lot of things, then if you make a change

13

00:01:01,079  -->  00:01:05,519
on one of them you've got to go through
each page and make the same change on

14

00:01:05,519  -->  00:01:12,510
those, so it gets kind of messy. So, that's
why we're using the main layout here, and so

15

00:01:12,510  -->  00:01:15,450
what we're going to do is go ahead and
create the main layout and i'll show you

16

00:01:15,450  -->  00:01:17,040
exactly what I mean.

17

00:01:17,040  -->  00:01:24,210
So i'm going to go ahead and create an
HTML file called "MainLayout" and then

18

00:01:24,210  -->  00:01:34,710
also another one called "Home" and these
dialogues aren't disappearing when i create

19

00:01:34,710  -->  00:01:44,729
new files I guess. So in home all we're going to be printing out is "&lt;h1&gt;Hello Codewizard&lt;/h1&gt;"

20

00:01:44,729  -->  00:01:52,710
going to save that, and then in MainLayout this is going

21

00:01:52,710  -->  00:01:58,110
going to be a little more involved. So
what we're going to have to do is we're

22

00:01:58,110  -->  00:02:06,990
going to have to, going to write "Codewizard" right here in the title,

23

00:02:07,620  -->  00:02:15,540
in the body element what we're going
to do is create a "&lt;div id&gt;="app"&gt;" then in

24

00:02:15,540  -->  00:02:21,690
that we're going to have to include
whatever file we're working with. So i'll

25

00:02:21,690  -->  00:02:26,340
show you that guys in a moment. In here
we're going to create our controller and

26

00:02:26,340  -->  00:02:31,920
so what we're going to do is we're going
to "return render.Home( )"

27

00:02:33,060  -->  00:02:37,140
it's that simple. Now right now if we
load it up nothing's going to happen

28

00:02:37,140  -->  00:02:42,750
because we're not actually using the
home variable over here. I'm going to save

29

00:02:42,750  -->  00:02:51,660
this, going to run the project, refresh
here, and you'll see that template takes

30

00:02:51,660  -->  00:03:04,050
0 arguments and one was given, let's
find out why that was. Alright, what we're

31

00:03:04,050  -->  00:03:08,400
going to have to do is in this file, this
might be the cause of the issue, we're

32

00:03:08,400  -->  00:03:13,950
going to "$def with (page)" because
this is being used as a base layout. So,

33

00:03:13,950  -->  00:03:19,440
the pages like if we load up home its
gonna load this, and then load home in

34

00:03:19,440  -->  00:03:23,970
there with whatever we need the variable.
So in order to include that in our page put

35

00:03:23,970  -->  00:03:28,530
a "$:page" and then the name of
the variable that you defined the main

36

00:03:28,530  -->  00:03:36,360
layout with. Let's save this, run it again,
refresh, and you'll see now that we've

37

00:03:36,360  -->  00:03:40,560
got the title code wizard, so you can see
it is loading the main layout, and then

38

00:03:40,560  -->  00:03:44,820
inside the main layout it's loading the
page, so all the content that's in here.

39

00:03:44,820  -->  00:03:48,270
Now, what we're going to do

40

00:03:48,270  -->  00:03:51,870
we've got all our css files in static
directory, so what we're going to do is

41

00:03:51,870  -->  00:03:56,730
we're going to include them into the
main layout. So we're actually going to

42

00:03:56,730  -->  00:04:03,120
define them right here as a variable so "$variable css:

43

00:04:03,120  -->  00:04:10,290
static/css/value/value.min.css

44

00:04:11,460  -->  00:04:22,770
static/css/bootstrap-material-design.min.css" Define it just like

45

00:04:22,770  -->  00:04:28,020
that, separate paths with a space, and
then in here in the header what we're

46

00:04:28,020  -->  00:04:31,980
going to do, if you guys haven't
figured this out yet basically you can

47

00:04:31,980  -->  00:04:35,670
write any Python code in here if you
proceed it with a dollar sign.

48

00:04:36,210  -->  00:04:42,840
So we're going to check if the CSS
variable exists, so "$ if css:" and we're

49

00:04:42,840  -->  00:04:53,070
going to go "$for style in css.split( )"
So essentially we're going to split this

50

00:04:53,070  -->  00:05:00,030
list, and it's gonna return each one of these in it's own instance. The we're going to print

51

00:05:00,030  -->  00:05:10,380
"&lt;link rel ="stylesheet" href="$style" /&gt;"

52

00:05:10,380  -->  00:05:20,040
If I save this and rerun

53

00:05:20,040  -->  00:05:23,580
the program here, when I reload it's going
to say

54

00:05:23,580  -->  00:05:31,530
syntax error, main layout, line 13. Line 13
is the end of the head here,

55

00:05:32,370  -->  00:05:35,820
something went terribly, terribly wrong.

56

00:05:35,820  -->  00:05:48,300
So let's try and figure out what that
problem is. So I've got oh, "is" that's the

57

00:05:48,300  -->  00:05:49,080
problem.

58

00:05:49,080  -->  00:06:00,000
Stop that, run it again, refresh, name
error css is not defined. So, let's go

59

00:06:00,000  -->  00:06:04,980
ahead and figure out why that's
happening. Creating a variable here

60

00:06:04,980  -->  00:06:16,560
called css, Local vars here for loop body,
and then css of self.css.

61

00:06:18,400  -->  00:06:31,539
Ok, I can access it like that, if we define a
variable in a template it gets loaded

62

00:06:31,539  -->  00:06:37,120
to in its own class essentially, so self.css. Any variables you create up here

63

00:06:37,120  -->  00:06:41,830
you need to access using self, and as you can see the style has changed and that

64

00:06:41,830  -->  00:06:46,509
indicates to us that it is loading the
appropriate style sheets. If I go and

65

00:06:46,509  -->  00:06:51,550
inspect it here, look in here, we can see
that yes it is actually including our

66

00:06:51,550  -->  00:06:55,960
style sheets. Now i'm also going to go
ahead and make my own style sheet in

67

00:06:55,960  -->  00:07:08,350
here called "swag" and this is where i'm
going to write on my custom css. And then

68

00:07:08,350  -->  00:07:13,539
basically that's how to set up the page,
in the next video I think we're going to

69

00:07:13,539  -->  00:07:17,259
be, well between now the next video, I'm
going to do it styling so if you guys

70

00:07:17,259  -->  00:07:21,009
want to style up the shell of an
application that would be neat to. We're going

71

00:07:21,009  -->  00:07:26,050
to be using a header bar and we're going
to be creating a forum for registering

72

00:07:26,050  -->  00:07:26,550
an account.
