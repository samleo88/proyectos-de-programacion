1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,179
Alright guys, welcome back. So, what I'm

2

00:00:03,179  -->  00:00:05,609
going to do right quick is just copy my

3

00:00:05,609  -->  00:00:08,460
style sheet from the main repository

4

00:00:08,460  -->  00:00:12,330
here, where is it, right there. I'm going to

5

00:00:12,330  -->  00:00:16,049
copy this into the browser, let me just open

6

00:00:16,049  -->  00:00:17,190
it up in raw,

7

00:00:17,190  -->  00:00:20,640
select all, and something really neat

8

00:00:20,640  -->  00:00:24,810
that I just did, and that I do a lot, is use

9

00:00:24,810  -->  00:00:28,470
keyboard shortcuts. I also don't have all

10

00:00:28,470  -->  00:00:31,769
these icons in here, so I need to remove

11

00:00:31,769  -->  00:00:34,559
these. I think that's the only instance

12

00:00:34,559  -->  00:00:39,450
of the error.

13

00:00:39,450  -->  00:00:41,730
Alright, so, if I restart the application

14

00:00:41,730  -->  00:00:45,050
then it should look fine.

15

00:00:46,829  -->  00:00:49,140
No, it doesn't but that's okay because

16

00:00:49,140  -->  00:00:50,969
this style sheet was built for different

17

00:00:50,969  -->  00:00:54,809
variables. So, but you'll notice the font

18

00:00:54,809  -->  00:00:57,899
is actually roboto. I did something

19

00:00:57,899  -->  00:01:01,949
with the size of the tabs too. So, let me

20

00:01:01,949  -->  00:01:04,699
undo all that.

21

00:01:08,930  -->  00:01:16,850
Alright, so, using shortcuts on your

22

00:01:16,850  -->  00:01:19,370
keyboard actually is a really

23

00:01:19,370  -->  00:01:22,280
essential part of any application

24

00:01:22,280  -->  00:01:23,930
nowadays, and so we're going to be doing

25

00:01:23,930  -->  00:01:25,820
that and we're going to be starting with

26

00:01:25,820  -->  00:01:28,010
QShortcuts, and I'm going to show you guys

27

00:01:28,010  -->  00:01:30,619
how to make one and then you guys can

28

00:01:30,619  -->  00:01:33,260
make other ones for anything else. You

29

00:01:33,260  -->  00:01:35,750
can also look it up if you'd like to. So

30

00:01:35,750  -->  00:01:41,780
what we need to import up here is in the

31

00:01:41,780  -->  00:01:44,509
Qt5 Widgets it's called

32

00:01:44,509  -->  00:01:50,450
KeySequenceEdit, and QShortcut. So, I'm

33

00:01:50,450  -->  00:01:55,040
going to type in here QShortcut and

34

00:01:55,040  -->  00:01:59,690
QKeySequenceEdit, and we need these

35

00:01:59,690  -->  00:02:02,149
two classes in order to actually create

36

00:02:02,149  -->  00:02:06,649
shortcuts. So, what we're going to do is

37

00:02:06,649  -->  00:02:08,330
just create a shortcut that will open a

38

00:02:08,330  -->  00:02:10,369
new tab, so it's going to be a command

39

00:02:10,369  -->  00:02:14,780
tab. I'm not sure, I've never tried

40

00:02:14,780  -->  00:02:18,230
actually on Mac OS where command

41

00:02:18,230  -->  00:02:20,570
takes the place of control on Windows, so

42

00:02:20,570  -->  00:02:23,600
I'm going to try it. If it doesn't work

43

00:02:23,600  -->  00:02:26,150
then I'm going to try another combination

44

00:02:26,150  -->  00:02:28,459
just so we can get something working,

45

00:02:28,459  -->  00:02:31,610
but basically it's really easy to do. So,

46

00:02:31,610  -->  00:02:36,140
let's go ahead and write self.shortcut

47

00:02:36,140  -->  00:02:42,860
NewTab equals QShortcut, and when we

48

00:02:42,860  -->  00:02:45,410
instantiate this it takes a key sequence

49

00:02:45,410  -->  00:02:48,140
which is basically what sequence of keys

50

00:02:48,140  -->  00:02:50,239
we want pressed in order to target the

51

00:02:50,239  -->  00:02:57,140
shortcut. So QKeySequence, and we

52

00:02:57,140  -->  00:02:58,850
actually don't need key sequence edit

53

00:02:58,850  -->  00:03:02,320
we need QKeySequence, where is that?

54

00:03:07,380  -->  00:03:17,070
Did I already import it maybe with the

55

00:03:17,070  -->  00:03:21,870
core? Where did I just write

56

00:03:21,870  -->  00:03:26,010
that? I can't find it. Oh, it's down here in add

57

00:03:26,010  -->  00:03:30,480
tabs. What I need to do is actually move

58

00:03:30,480  -->  00:03:36,330
that way up here in the create app. So

59

00:03:36,330  -->  00:03:39,390
the QKeySequence doesn't look like

60

00:03:39,390  -->  00:03:42,900
it got imported, so I'm not sure if I

61

00:03:42,900  -->  00:03:51,000
imported it with, oh ok, so it's within

62

00:03:51,000  -->  00:03:54,810
QtGui.

63

00:03:54,810  -->  00:03:59,520
There we go. Alright, so, where is, alright.

64

00:03:59,520  -->  00:04:01,980
So we created a new tab shortcut. Now

65

00:04:01,980  -->  00:04:04,770
we're opening up a

66

00:04:04,770  -->  00:04:06,480
QShortcut, we're creating an object from

67

00:04:06,480  -->  00:04:09,090
that, and that takes in one parameter, or two

68

00:04:09,090  -->  00:04:11,520
parameters rather. The first one is a

69

00:04:11,520  -->  00:04:16,020
QKeySequence, and the second one is just

70

00:04:16,020  -->  00:04:19,410
the class name that target's it, so self.

71

00:04:19,410  -->  00:04:22,470
Now the QKeySequence that we're

72

00:04:22,470  -->  00:04:26,400
going to tie it is Cmd+T, and it's

73

00:04:26,400  -->  00:04:27,780
really that easy. If you're on Windows

74

00:04:27,780  -->  00:04:31,980
you're going to type Ctrl+T.

75

00:04:31,980  -->  00:04:33,630
I'm on Mac so I'm going to try to make

76

00:04:33,630  -->  00:04:35,730
this work here. What we need to do is we

77

00:04:35,730  -->  00:04:38,760
need to connect the activated signal of

78

00:04:38,760  -->  00:04:41,040
the shortcut to whatever method

79

00:04:41,040  -->  00:04:45,150
we want to run. So, self.shortcutNewTab.

80

00:04:45,150  -->  00:04:50,370
activated.connect, and we're

81

00:04:50,370  -->  00:04:54,450
going to say self.AddTab. I'm going

82

00:04:54,450  -->  00:04:56,520
to save and run it, and let's see if this works.

83

00:04:56,520  -->  00:05:06,300
I'm going to go ahead and press command T, and

84

00:05:06,300  -->  00:05:08,470
nothing happened.

85

00:05:08,470  -->  00:05:15,550
So let me try, right now let's just Shift+T, and

86

00:05:15,550  -->  00:05:18,880
this is not a good idea because Shift+T

87

00:05:18,880  -->  00:05:20,680
is supposed to capitalize it here if

88

00:05:20,680  -->  00:05:24,850
you're typing something, so there we go.

89

00:05:24,850  -->  00:05:27,700
Shift+T works, Cmd+T doesn't. Let me

90

00:05:27,700  -->  00:05:31,870
try setting this to Ctrl, maybe Qt

91

00:05:31,870  -->  00:05:33,700
is smart enough to recognize well hey

92

00:05:33,700  -->  00:05:36,070
this is not a Mac. So, we should use command,

93

00:05:36,070  -->  00:05:41,200
and it does. Okay, so,

94

00:05:41,200  -->  00:05:43,810
that's how you create a key shortcut

95

00:05:43,810  -->  00:05:45,610
and it can be for any sequence of keys. You

96

00:05:45,610  -->  00:05:49,360
can do for developer tools I use ctrl

97

00:05:49,360  -->  00:05:49,900
shift

98

00:05:49,900  -->  00:05:53,170
i in my Python browser that I already

99

00:05:53,170  -->  00:05:56,650
built. Let's do a reload as well.

100

00:05:56,650  -->  00:06:04,120
self.shortcutReload equals QShortcut,

101

00:06:04,120  -->  00:06:15,190
QKeySequence, we'll say Ctrl+R, and

102

00:06:15,190  -->  00:06:17,140
it's gonna be a shortcut on this

103

00:06:17,140  -->  00:06:19,540
itself. And we're going to say self.

104

00:06:19,540  -->  00:06:21,580
shortcut

105

00:06:21,580  -->  00:06:26,890
Reload.activated.connect to self.

106

00:06:26,890  -->  00:06:34,180
ReloadPage. So if I save this and

107

00:06:34,180  -->  00:06:36,600
run it again

108

00:06:39,390  -->  00:06:42,630
I'm going to press

109

00:06:42,630  -->  00:06:46,290
Command+T, it opens up a new tab, and I'm going

110

00:06:46,290  -->  00:06:48,660
to hit Command+R and you are going to see that it

111

00:06:48,660  -->  00:06:51,810
refreshes it. So what we're going to be

112

00:06:51,810  -->  00:06:56,370
talking about in the next video, I think

113

00:06:56,370  -->  00:06:58,170
actually we've learned everything that

114

00:06:58,170  -->  00:06:59,880
we really need to learn to make a web

115

00:06:59,880  -->  00:07:02,010
browser and to get you guys familiar with

116

00:07:02,010  -->  00:07:05,370
how Qt works. Essentially, you're taking

117

00:07:05,370  -->  00:07:09,390
widgets, you're setting a layout, and then

118

00:07:09,390  -->  00:07:11,730
you're stuffing other widgets into those

119

00:07:11,730  -->  00:07:15,030
layouts. That's essentially all Qt5

120

00:07:15,030  -->  00:07:17,130
is, and you can do really

121

00:07:17,130  -->  00:07:19,830
awesome stuff with it. Now if you had a

122

00:07:19,830  -->  00:07:22,050
icon here, let me just go try and

123

00:07:22,050  -->  00:07:29,640
download a blank image, so logo png.

124

00:07:29,640  -->  00:07:40,170
Sure, let's grab this PlayStation logo. I'm to

125

00:07:40,170  -->  00:07:49,500
save it into my projects,

126

00:07:49,500  -->  00:07:59,640
PycharmProjects. It is in,

127

00:07:59,640  -->  00:08:03,240
what did I call this?

128

00:08:03,240  -->  00:08:08,090
Web-browser.

129

00:08:10,969  -->  00:08:12,469
So I'm going to come in here and I'm going to

130

00:08:12,469  -->  00:08:23,299
save it right here as logo.png. Now when I

131

00:08:23,299  -->  00:08:24,739
jump over here

132

00:08:24,739  -->  00:08:26,689
it automatically picks it up. So what you can

133

00:08:26,689  -->  00:08:28,519
do in the application is you can set the

134

00:08:28,519  -->  00:08:30,139
app icon, so I'm going to run self.

135

00:08:30,139  -->  00:08:36,289
setWindowIcon, and then we're going

136

00:08:36,289  -->  00:08:40,250
to say it's QIcon, and it's going to be

137

00:08:40,250  -->  00:08:43,189
logo.png. This can be a relative

138

00:08:43,189  -->  00:08:50,120
path to the logo file itself. Now you'll

139

00:08:50,120  -->  00:08:51,829
see that the logo got set right here it, it

140

00:08:51,829  -->  00:08:53,870
should also get set on the dock, but I think

141

00:08:53,870  -->  00:08:56,449
with Qt5 on Mac OS you have to do some

142

00:08:56,449  -->  00:08:58,790
different stuff in order to get it to

143

00:08:58,790  -->  00:09:02,600
set on the dock itself. I know

144

00:09:02,600  -->  00:09:09,050
with the web browser

145

00:09:09,050  -->  00:09:13,040
on windows you have to import

146

00:09:13,040  -->  00:09:15,379
ctypes, then you have to run a command

147

00:09:15,379  -->  00:09:17,689
up at the top, and I don't

148

00:09:17,689  -->  00:09:19,279
remember specifically what it is. You

149

00:09:19,279  -->  00:09:21,439
need to setup an app ID, essentially, and

150

00:09:21,439  -->  00:09:24,199
then that will let it set the taskbar

151

00:09:24,199  -->  00:09:27,079
icon from whatever you set right here. So,

152

00:09:27,079  -->  00:09:30,680
I think that's it with Qt5. I hope you

153

00:09:30,680  -->  00:09:32,600
guys enjoyed this and we're going to be

154

00:09:32,600  -->  00:09:36,139
getting to data visualization I think

155

00:09:36,139  -->  00:09:38,480
next, and then we'll come back, we'll

156

00:09:38,480  -->  00:09:42,649
circle back around, to some other GUI

157

00:09:42,649  -->  00:09:46,279
libraries, or I mean this is

158

00:09:46,279  -->  00:09:47,029
probably fine.

159

00:09:47,029  -->  00:09:48,860
So, what we'll do is we'll do some data

160

00:09:48,860  -->  00:09:51,559
visualization and then i would like to

161

00:09:51,559  -->  00:09:56,740
start on making video games in Python.
