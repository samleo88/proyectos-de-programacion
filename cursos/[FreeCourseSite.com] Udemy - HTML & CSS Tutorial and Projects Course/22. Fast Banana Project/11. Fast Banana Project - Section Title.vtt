WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:05.910
And the next section are going to be building is going to be are here in the services section or you

00:05.910 --> 00:07.150
can see or hear just ahead.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.240
All right.

00:08.360 --> 00:12.420
This is going to be a little bit different title that we actually used all the time right.

00:12.630 --> 00:16.790
So first of all can actually build this read We're going to start building the skills that are actually

00:16.800 --> 00:20.710
going to build this title because what's going to happen later on we're actually going to be reusing

00:20.720 --> 00:24.200
the style right here we're going to look at a fluxbox property.

00:24.200 --> 00:24.420
Right.

00:24.420 --> 00:26.970
So how we can very easily flip them around.

00:26.970 --> 00:27.490
Right.

00:27.540 --> 00:29.710
You can see or hear this is going to be right side.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.920
And this is going to be another time.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.710
So let's go ahead and let's start working on that.

00:34.710 --> 00:42.360
So like I said we're going to be back in session here at home or here and you can see that end of icon

00:42.390 --> 00:43.180
section.

00:43.490 --> 00:50.400
So I'm going to place and of icons section then after that we're going to make a comment and this is

00:50.400 --> 00:55.550
going to be a services section or skill section doesn't really matter.

00:55.700 --> 00:57.940
Right over here and this is going to be skills.

00:57.940 --> 01:04.620
So I'm going to say we're here skills you know this select line copy and paste the line we are all going

01:04.620 --> 01:08.460
to say and the skills and of skills.

01:08.460 --> 01:14.640
Then after that the first thing that I would want to do is have a section ready and this is going to

01:14.640 --> 01:15.590
be skills.

01:15.810 --> 01:16.200
Right.

01:16.370 --> 01:22.110
So then we're going to present all your skills and then here we're going to place a title I'm going

01:22.150 --> 01:30.060
to say title and select and line up a line and I'm going to say in the title and of title and here we're

01:30.070 --> 01:31.840
going to have a place on him.

01:31.890 --> 01:36.840
All right we're going to start off here with a deal with the class of title or here.

01:36.900 --> 01:45.570
Then within that day we're going to have a div of title or I can press tabel you like this and then

01:45.570 --> 01:53.750
we're going to have a phantasm someone to say hi hey hey we're here Gere's first time all right.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.650
And now we got all gears are here.

01:55.890 --> 01:58.700
And after that we would want a title text.

01:58.720 --> 01:59.130
Right.

01:59.280 --> 02:05.760
But again we need to watch it right because this is going to be live right with one Dave and I can do.

02:05.780 --> 02:07.520
And now you would want to text.

02:07.570 --> 02:11.640
So I'm going to create another Dave and this is going to be tied up here.

02:11.660 --> 02:19.640
TEXT religionis and then with within the title text a few things this is going to be heading to or here

02:19.700 --> 02:23.100
and we're going to say skills that we provide.

02:23.220 --> 02:31.480
All right so I'm going to say skills or here we provide provide or here and then we're going to cross-tab.

02:31.620 --> 02:33.780
And now we have skills we provide.

02:33.990 --> 02:39.270
And we're going to have a paragraph here I'm going to read and this is going to be a paragraph and so

02:39.290 --> 02:42.480
we're going to have a five words right.

02:42.500 --> 02:46.040
I'm going to press tab and another table here.

02:46.060 --> 02:52.260
Right so now we have our title and now we can actually want to see who says and starts telling this

02:52.320 --> 02:59.250
that right and then we're going we're going to have the M-L for the skills and the actual skills.

02:59.300 --> 02:59.790
Right.

02:59.990 --> 03:02.890
So let's say this here let's go to Maine.

03:02.920 --> 03:08.900
He says We're here again and that's the comment we're going I'm going to hate tile.

03:08.920 --> 03:13.790
So I'm going to say tight over here again hashtags like this.

03:13.790 --> 03:18.640
And then we're all going to do is we're going to create a bunch of room just so we can actually work.

03:18.790 --> 03:19.360
Right.

03:19.650 --> 03:24.350
And here we're going to say is like this we're going to say this is going to be tidal and or here we're

03:24.350 --> 03:28.980
going to say in this play flex because we want them actually side by side.

03:28.980 --> 03:29.490
All right.

03:29.530 --> 03:30.830
We can see or hear it.

03:30.860 --> 03:32.570
This isn't the end result right.

03:32.570 --> 03:34.350
You can see them side by side.

03:34.550 --> 03:37.850
And that was the reason why we actually created two containers right.

03:37.910 --> 03:43.490
So text would be in one container and the icons in the other display.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.480
Flex healing.

03:46.880 --> 03:50.910
Then once we have this play for let's let's just add some padding all around.

03:50.910 --> 04:00.370
So I'm going to say padding 20 pixels read 20 pixels all around the and then we have a title icon fantastic

04:00.440 --> 04:02.010
like title.

04:02.470 --> 04:11.890
I can hear from Tarsem or here we're going to say font size say 60 pixels like this right.

04:11.980 --> 04:12.980
This is going to be for fun.

04:13.050 --> 04:13.990
Awesome.

04:14.240 --> 04:15.750
Have a color.

04:15.870 --> 04:20.900
FFC we're on this 9 1 4 4 here.

04:20.950 --> 04:27.030
Then we'll have a margin to see margin right and what your eye is going to be 10 pixels.

04:27.140 --> 04:32.470
Right so we're going to push the whole text a little bit away and after that we're going to have a title

04:32.590 --> 04:36.220
text so I'm going to say title right text.

04:36.550 --> 04:38.970
And over here we're going to have few things right.

04:38.980 --> 04:43.530
First of all we want a padding to the left just to push it away.

04:43.550 --> 04:52.090
So I'm going to say padding left and pixels like this will have a border on here and we're going to

04:52.090 --> 04:53.830
say the left right.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.680
And this is going to be Bordereau here on the left hand side.

04:56.880 --> 05:03.300
Well as you said three pixels and you can see that my cursor is missing three pixels.

05:03.430 --> 05:06.490
Solid hash tag like this.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.150
And then it's going to be the gray color.

05:08.380 --> 05:14.620
So be 5 C 2 and be 7 like this.

05:14.620 --> 05:21.520
And then after you have text transform operatives text transform uppercase or healing this right.

05:21.530 --> 05:25.450
So the whole thing we have a text transform.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.290
Then after that we would want a heading.

05:28.370 --> 05:36.370
And so I'm going to say all on here heading here like this and then we're going to say color or here

05:36.500 --> 05:37.870
we're going to have a hash tag.

05:37.870 --> 05:44.950
Now we're basically dealing over here with this adding on the top one here to the two.

05:45.190 --> 05:51.820
And then we have eight to a railing this and then after that we would want a subheading.

05:51.820 --> 05:54.060
So I'm going to say we're here.

05:54.760 --> 05:59.560
So I'm reading one here and then I'm going to say padding.

05:59.770 --> 06:06.280
We're still going to have a five pixel padding all around and then we would want to do is actually have

06:06.370 --> 06:07.690
a text transfer.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.320
But let me just double check with it.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.760
I actually had a declasse right.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.290
And you can see that actually I didn't.

06:14.320 --> 06:14.720
Right.

06:14.740 --> 06:20.500
And that's when nothing is working or here because what happened was that actually for this heading

06:20.570 --> 06:29.740
to what we want is class and we're going to say all here tired all adding more to this and for the paragraph

06:29.740 --> 06:36.570
we're going to have title subheading so we can just copy and paste this one here like this one.

06:36.640 --> 06:39.500
Well we're going to have a copy right.

06:39.520 --> 06:45.130
So I'm going to be selecting this up with this one over here starting over here.

06:45.130 --> 06:49.210
Copy and paste and this is going to be subheading on here like this.

06:49.210 --> 06:51.290
Now I can see that there are two things work.

06:51.460 --> 06:58.200
So we say this man says We're here we're going to go back and we're going to finish with the rules right.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.250
Because we don't have much left anyway.

07:00.520 --> 07:09.020
Now we have a pairing and then we would want a text here transform and we're going to say capitalize

07:09.320 --> 07:13.070
on your likeness and then we'll have a color hash tag.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.840
And this is going to be five here.

07:15.970 --> 07:19.750
See two more here and then we have B seven.

07:19.750 --> 07:20.590
All right.

07:20.590 --> 07:24.820
So basically we're adding There's great color and the same one we added or here and this is going to

07:24.820 --> 07:26.570
be pretty much it for the tile.

07:26.590 --> 07:27.180
Right.

07:27.220 --> 07:30.740
What's going to be happening is we're going to be copying pasting this title right.

07:30.880 --> 07:36.550
And like I said we're going to be just flipping them around adding different texts and adding different

07:36.550 --> 07:36.960
icons.

07:36.970 --> 07:42.550
But this is really nice that we have set it up right because now we're ready to go on and actually work

07:42.550 --> 07:44.300
on our skills section.
