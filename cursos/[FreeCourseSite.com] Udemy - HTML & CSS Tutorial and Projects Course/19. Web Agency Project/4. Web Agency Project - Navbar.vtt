WEBVTT

00:00.650 --> 00:04.060
And for this project I'm going to be using seven images.

00:04.060 --> 00:08.120
I'm going to be using here this one and I'll have this background.

00:08.340 --> 00:09.930
This is going to be called Project.

00:09.930 --> 00:14.580
This is going to be for the project and we're going to have for the filler then we're going to have

00:14.640 --> 00:17.620
a services over here and this is going to be here.

00:17.640 --> 00:18.160
Right.

00:18.270 --> 00:21.470
And everything else is pretty much the same like we already did.

00:21.480 --> 00:26.160
Now the only thing that extra that I did over here you can see that we're going to have a small screen

00:26.170 --> 00:31.770
right so we can right away see for the moment you know here we have a theme that actually we're going

00:31.770 --> 00:32.750
to be creating.

00:32.810 --> 00:33.360
Right.

00:33.390 --> 00:38.160
And this is the one that we're actually working on right so we're all going to work we're going to do

00:38.160 --> 00:39.990
or here we're going to be able to see.

00:40.080 --> 00:44.100
And this is already the finished Web site right so we can check it out it.

00:44.100 --> 00:45.770
We did everything correctly.

00:45.900 --> 00:49.140
And the first thing that we need to do is create this map.

00:49.170 --> 00:49.820
Right.

00:49.830 --> 00:55.290
So let's go ahead and let's go here to the body section or here and I'm just going to create a little

00:55.290 --> 00:58.500
bit more room so you can see better what's happening.

00:58.500 --> 01:03.110
I think we can make this one smaller because we're either way going to be using this for the mobile

01:03.130 --> 01:09.300
view and we're here what I'm going to say this is going to be a comment I'm going to send this is going

01:09.300 --> 01:10.040
to be now.

01:10.400 --> 01:14.760
And once we have the now I'm just going to say this is going to be not element and this is going to

01:14.760 --> 01:20.130
be an ordered list and this is going to be a list item and then the last item we're going to have a

01:20.130 --> 01:20.490
try.

01:20.600 --> 01:21.110
Right.

01:21.160 --> 01:26.850
So I'm going to say this is going to be a link like this and this is going to be dummy link over here.

01:27.030 --> 01:31.710
But for the first one I'm going to actually have a class and I'm going to say that the class is going

01:31.710 --> 01:36.690
to be low because we're going to style this one little bit differently and we're going to say this is

01:36.690 --> 01:41.870
going to be web agency and or here and this is also going to have a phone to us.

01:41.940 --> 01:49.060
I might say it is going to be I have a half a and we're going to say narrow it down.

01:49.470 --> 01:51.760
I think some of this is going to be out font of some.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.570
Right so we have our first one.

01:53.700 --> 02:00.550
And for some reason the agency went in we didn't want or here's what I'm going to do is all right.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.630
Agency.

02:02.730 --> 02:08.060
Agency and then or here we just need to write I so apologize for that.

02:08.070 --> 02:13.220
And now we have a web agency and now we have done a fantastic night.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.420
And then we need another few weeks.

02:15.420 --> 02:15.640
Right.

02:15.640 --> 02:19.330
So total we would have six so we would need five more.

02:19.530 --> 02:23.980
So what I'm going to do we're here I'm going to copy this guy but I'm just going to delete this phone

02:25.020 --> 02:26.010
because I don't need it.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.720
I just need it for the first one.

02:27.780 --> 02:35.910
So if I do this and instead of with my agency I'm going to say this is going to be a actually let's

02:35.910 --> 02:40.710
say this is not also going to have a logo on it and it's not going to be a or logo.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.180
And this is just going to be home.

02:42.320 --> 02:47.430
And so we're all going to run this is going to be home and we're going to copy this guy and we're going

02:47.430 --> 02:50.510
to have skilled services portfolio.

02:50.590 --> 02:56.670
Now that just copy this line here and this is one two three.

02:56.760 --> 03:03.900
We're here for it's all him home skills services portfolio and work.

03:04.090 --> 03:06.200
So really going around this is going to be skills

03:09.410 --> 03:10.330
skills.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.440
On here and this is going to be services.

03:13.480 --> 03:13.770
Right.

03:13.780 --> 03:20.540
So we're going to say this is going to be services and this is going to be over here instead of home.

03:20.550 --> 03:24.680
It's going to be portfolio and then we need one more.

03:24.990 --> 03:31.260
So grab over here and just copy this guy and we're going to say this is going to be what it's all going

03:31.260 --> 03:33.050
to go back over here.

03:33.150 --> 03:38.550
We're going to let's maybe use a beautiful way to make it a little bit better.

03:38.550 --> 03:38.820
Right.

03:38.820 --> 03:40.850
So they look a little bit nicer.

03:40.870 --> 03:46.730
And now that we have the links we're obviously going to go to means this and start styling here.

03:46.730 --> 03:47.330
Right.

03:47.430 --> 03:52.080
So if we go back and see this the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm just going to write down the

03:52.080 --> 03:56.730
colors that I'm going to be using right now I'm going to be making a comment over here I'm just going

03:56.730 --> 04:03.420
to say that for a black or here I'm just going to say it is going to be black and this is going to be

04:03.450 --> 04:09.510
1 9 1 7 1 6 1 7 1 6 here.

04:09.690 --> 04:14.850
And then we will need to copy this three times one two three and we're really going to write and this

04:14.850 --> 04:21.470
is going to be for the white one white and for the white one is going to be a little bit different right.

04:21.480 --> 04:24.290
Obviously he and then we'll get to zero.

04:24.300 --> 04:31.690
He will have to be to the right then the next one is going to be yellow.

04:31.770 --> 04:32.690
All right.

04:32.800 --> 04:37.120
Hello and for the hour going to be using a E6.

04:37.240 --> 04:46.060
So the hash tag six and we're going to have a F and then we're going to have to be right and then we're

04:46.060 --> 04:46.970
going to have a great one.

04:47.010 --> 04:49.210
So we're going to come back here and say Great.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.150
And the gray one is going to be B E B B B.

04:53.290 --> 04:56.690
And they're going to have 7 8 4 7 4.

04:56.850 --> 05:01.100
Now that we have the colors right now the first rule that we're going to be creating is going to be

05:01.100 --> 05:06.320
for the whole document and we're going to say that this isn't going to have a margin of zero.

05:06.400 --> 05:13.660
And so all the elements initially right margin zero padding zero zero.

05:13.940 --> 05:17.700
And over here we're going to say this is going to be a box sizing.

05:18.060 --> 05:21.680
I know we're going to say box sizing is going to be border box right.

05:21.770 --> 05:23.150
So you know like this.

05:23.150 --> 05:27.540
And then when we had one we have for the whole document we can actually start styling.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.120
Right.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.650
So over here I'm just going to put the body.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.430
Here I'm going to write a column and this is going to be now.

05:33.860 --> 05:36.540
And what was going to be the first rule for the now.

05:36.860 --> 05:41.900
What he's going to say and this is going to be none of your well written or least list style type.

05:41.910 --> 05:43.040
None.

05:43.190 --> 05:44.470
None here.

05:44.540 --> 05:48.050
And we're going to have a border top and.

05:48.150 --> 05:55.400
We're going to have a yellow lights on and say six pixels solid so they know we're here and we're going

05:55.400 --> 06:00.470
to use the night so we can just write it or we can just copy this one is obviously going to be a little

06:00.470 --> 06:01.470
bit faster.

06:01.760 --> 06:06.240
So we just go here copy this and go here and we just paste.

06:06.290 --> 06:06.660
Right.

06:06.830 --> 06:09.530
So now we have the yellow border on the top.

06:09.530 --> 06:13.280
Then we have a list actual link right.

06:13.610 --> 06:15.170
So we're going to say we're here now.

06:15.350 --> 06:16.140
We're here.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.460
Well hello I say.

06:18.710 --> 06:23.700
And what would be the properties and values would want to change text decoration.

06:23.930 --> 06:26.400
None none.

06:26.420 --> 06:33.090
And we're going to have a display here we're going to say this is going to be block here and this and

06:33.200 --> 06:42.270
this play lock and we're going to be saying that this is going to be also a text align center text on

06:42.570 --> 06:44.410
your center.

06:44.450 --> 06:51.710
We're going to have a font size 20 on size over here and we're going to say this is going to be 20 pixels

06:52.300 --> 07:00.760
and then we're going to have a padding and padding is going to be 15 pixels by 25 pixels or you know

07:00.790 --> 07:07.750
I guess and then we're going to have a color and the color is actually going to be that black.

07:07.810 --> 07:08.360
Right.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.470
So we're going to go here.

07:09.470 --> 07:13.500
This is going to be sort Sorry it's going to be the yellow one or here.

07:13.690 --> 07:15.800
So if we go back over here.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.160
Copy and paste this right.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.920
So it's going to be E-6 a f 2.

07:21.290 --> 07:30.850
So he E-6 a have to know guess and that obviously you would want a background right for the actual you.

07:30.950 --> 07:36.610
Right or here you can see that I actually missed a background color so I'm going to say Baghran code

07:36.620 --> 07:43.120
here and I'm going to say this is going to be the black on rights 1 9 7 1 6.

07:43.200 --> 07:50.240
Right so now we have the black one and the links are also down right now we would want as we were hovering

07:50.240 --> 07:52.520
over the links we would want a different color.

07:52.520 --> 07:52.960
Right.

07:53.170 --> 07:56.170
So I'm going to create a little bit more space so I can see better.

07:56.460 --> 07:58.850
I don't know if we're going to say we're hovering right.

07:58.890 --> 08:00.840
Some things should be different.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.040
We're just going to copy this guy.

08:03.060 --> 08:07.610
You know we're going to pace that and we're going to say that this is going to be over and as we're

08:07.640 --> 08:10.300
covering the color is going to be a white one.

08:10.320 --> 08:10.840
Right.

08:10.870 --> 08:14.170
Well whitish and it's not going to be completely white.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.680
So we're all going to say this is going to be easy.

08:16.840 --> 08:23.800
And then we're going to have zero G and then we're going up to the B to the right so I can say this

08:23.810 --> 08:25.990
guy we're here and we can check it out.

08:25.990 --> 08:28.040
Right so this is going to be the white one.

08:28.160 --> 08:31.820
Now also you need to style the logo.

08:31.820 --> 08:32.090
Right.

08:32.090 --> 08:37.660
So remember that first one that we created the web agency we would need to style this right.

08:37.670 --> 08:42.380
So here I'm going to say for this law go right for this class some some time in the class.

08:42.380 --> 08:44.270
Now I can see what's happening right.

08:44.270 --> 08:47.350
First we're going to say this is going to be a display of flex right.

08:47.570 --> 08:52.790
Because you can see that I won them actually not side my side and one them actually separate right.

08:52.810 --> 08:53.990
So when I said this.

08:54.350 --> 09:01.280
Flex right there I'm going to say text transfer when you're transformed I'm going to say this is going

09:01.280 --> 09:03.220
to be upper case.

09:03.290 --> 09:06.350
Upper case like this or here maybe.

09:06.410 --> 09:13.040
Right away as we have this play flex let's deal with a flex and say this is going to be justify content

09:13.420 --> 09:16.840
and here space between right now we have this one.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.030
I can see the font awesome right away flies all the way to the right.

09:20.110 --> 09:20.840
Yeah.

09:20.930 --> 09:27.590
So now we have a text transform that we want a font size and we're going to say it's going to be 40

09:27.590 --> 09:30.700
pixels and then we're going to have a background.

09:30.920 --> 09:31.460
Right.

09:31.610 --> 09:33.410
And the background is actually going to be different.

09:33.410 --> 09:33.700
Right.

09:33.710 --> 09:42.830
So we're here we're going to say the six hey we're here and then it's going to be too high for this.

09:42.890 --> 09:50.820
And then the actual color is going to be the black it's 1 9 1 7 1 7 1 6 9.

09:50.840 --> 09:57.230
So it's other way around how it would be interacted with links and then the font style is going to be

09:57.510 --> 10:01.950
taluk taluk then we need to add the rule as we're having.

10:01.950 --> 10:02.420
Right.

10:02.590 --> 10:06.700
So the background color is going to be different and actual colors are going to be different.

10:06.880 --> 10:11.640
So rerum so low and are here I'm going to say have I.

10:11.740 --> 10:16.750
And what we're going to say or her background color and the background color is going to be on here.

10:16.990 --> 10:19.500
And the zero G.

10:19.580 --> 10:29.500
And then is going to be to be to the right and then the color is going to be or the 6 a 6 and 8.

10:29.710 --> 10:34.210
And then this is going to be F to the two.

10:34.630 --> 10:39.690
And so we can go ahead and check it out over here when we have with the web engines he writes or going

10:39.690 --> 10:45.190
to have a white one and the actual color is going to be right now the most interesting part or here.

10:45.220 --> 10:45.670
Right.

10:45.850 --> 10:48.240
So you can see that we have set up for the small screen right.

10:48.250 --> 10:49.120
Everything is working.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.520
Everything looks nice right.

10:50.650 --> 10:55.650
But if I say this over here and if we go to the big screen right it's also going to look the same.

10:55.660 --> 10:56.040
Right.

10:56.170 --> 10:57.370
And this is not what we want.

10:57.370 --> 10:59.820
We obviously would want a bigger screen.

10:59.830 --> 11:00.100
Right.

11:00.100 --> 11:04.930
So the moment we're actually leaving the small screen where I actually would want it to be laid out

11:04.960 --> 11:05.880
in a row.

11:05.960 --> 11:11.280
So what we're going to do over here is we're going to have a responsive mini screen.

11:11.320 --> 11:18.430
And so we're going to go here and we're going to write that this is going to be media at media and then

11:18.430 --> 11:21.390
we're going to say screen and then we're going to.

11:21.430 --> 11:22.040
Right.

11:22.120 --> 11:27.600
And the minimum with actually is going to be a five hundred seventy six pixels.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.970
And I just stole this one from a trap right.

11:30.980 --> 11:32.050
Because that's what they have.

11:32.050 --> 11:38.420
So for the smaller screen right now they have five so many sects so I just took that one as an example

11:38.420 --> 11:39.520
I'm going to go off.

11:39.570 --> 11:39.990
Right.

11:40.210 --> 11:44.220
So only when we're leaving the small screen what should happen right.

11:44.350 --> 11:45.950
First we're going to target a.

11:46.000 --> 11:46.820
Now have you.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.810
All right.

11:47.890 --> 11:53.800
We're all going to say that this is going to be this play and we're going to say this play for x y once

11:53.800 --> 11:56.980
we have the flex then we would want a flex.

11:57.760 --> 12:04.270
Because what's going to happen is as we're actually making this screen smaller the actual links are

12:04.270 --> 12:05.700
going to be bumping into each other.

12:05.700 --> 12:06.160
Right.

12:06.240 --> 12:10.000
There are going to be shrinking and we don't want that we're just going to say this is going to be flex

12:10.420 --> 12:15.100
or here we're going to say wrap it and we're going to say this is going to be rapid.

12:15.240 --> 12:20.440
So they're not really going to be stacking underneath each other once the screen gets more than we're

12:20.440 --> 12:24.180
going to have a whole line items and we're going to say baseline.

12:24.340 --> 12:26.680
And the reason for that is for the bigger screen.

12:26.760 --> 12:27.340
Right.

12:27.370 --> 12:34.360
What's going to happen is that over here can see that I didn't say this means VSS I mean but if I say

12:34.370 --> 12:39.630
this right for the bigger screen what's happening is that this font size is going to be different than

12:39.630 --> 12:39.930
this.

12:39.940 --> 12:40.500
Right.

12:40.540 --> 12:45.510
So you don't want to actually center these ones or something like you can just go online baseline.

12:45.650 --> 12:49.710
They're all going to be the same because they're all going to be actually looking at the value where

12:49.720 --> 12:51.200
the text is right now.

12:51.250 --> 12:56.170
How big are the boxes and when we're talking about wrapping you can see right at the moment it's actually

12:56.170 --> 12:57.820
going to hit this edge.

12:57.880 --> 13:01.380
It's actually going to wrapped in the next line instead of actually shrinking.

13:01.410 --> 13:06.430
Right so it's going to look much more nicer once we have the baseline done then we're going to say that

13:06.430 --> 13:12.880
we would want a justified count in between right over here can say this is going to be space between

13:13.180 --> 13:17.520
here and then what we would want is actually styled the actual links right.

13:17.570 --> 13:19.850
And we're going to say this going to me now.

13:19.990 --> 13:20.400
Hello.

13:20.410 --> 13:21.130
Hi.

13:21.130 --> 13:27.300
And we're going to use a flex property and we're going to say can to be flex and this should grow always

13:27.310 --> 13:29.470
that's why we're going to set it to one more here.

13:29.470 --> 13:32.450
We're going to say this is never going to shrink so it's going to be zero.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.030
And this is going to be hard.

13:34.360 --> 13:38.970
Remember one thing that when you're using this order right you're not specifically saying how big it

13:38.970 --> 13:39.810
is right.

13:39.820 --> 13:45.710
You're just pretty much saying whatever how big the link is that's how it always should stay.

13:45.760 --> 13:50.190
Now the way you control the link is over here with this padding right now.

13:50.210 --> 13:50.630
Right.

13:50.800 --> 13:56.020
Because if you're not specifically say so remember if you're going to settle here padding to let's say

13:56.020 --> 13:57.100
60.

13:57.110 --> 13:57.660
Right.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.430
And this is going to go here back.

13:59.470 --> 14:00.010
Right.

14:00.010 --> 14:04.030
So obviously there are going to be shrinking way faster right now I can see that there's three of them

14:04.030 --> 14:04.460
right.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.830
Because the actual padding is much more bigger.

14:06.850 --> 14:07.480
Right.

14:07.510 --> 14:10.500
So I'm going to go back and I'm going to sell it to 25.

14:10.510 --> 14:11.940
I said I had before.

14:12.040 --> 14:12.400
Right.

14:12.520 --> 14:17.410
But remember that with the padding is that's where you were actually controlling the width of the actual

14:17.410 --> 14:20.740
link and then you're going to have a full logo.

14:20.740 --> 14:21.170
Right.

14:21.310 --> 14:27.430
I don't want this phantasm to be on a bigger screen so I'm going to say logo here and I'm going to say

14:27.580 --> 14:29.500
this is going to be display block.

14:29.650 --> 14:30.020
Right.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.700
So first of all just set the whole thing as display block.

14:33.960 --> 14:40.120
We're going to have a text align center next to line center and the last thing is going to be actual

14:40.120 --> 14:40.450
font.

14:40.450 --> 14:41.150
Awesome.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.960
So we're going to sell go and we're going to say for phantasm.

14:45.070 --> 14:45.700
Right.

14:45.910 --> 14:48.870
Not a log log but actual long ago.

14:48.890 --> 14:53.860
And here we're going to say they would want a display and we're going to say none.

14:54.340 --> 15:01.390
So for the bigger screen with one we wouldn't want it to show so now we say this actually we can refresh.

15:01.450 --> 15:04.300
And this should look exactly the same like we had before.

15:04.300 --> 15:04.960
Right.

15:04.980 --> 15:07.170
So you can see that we have one agency right.

15:07.240 --> 15:11.000
We have the hovering effect and as we're hovering over the links right.

15:11.020 --> 15:12.690
But then they're not shrinking.

15:12.700 --> 15:13.040
Right.

15:13.090 --> 15:18.700
So as you can see it is screening at smaller smaller and the moment actually the link is supposed to

15:18.700 --> 15:19.920
start to shrink.

15:19.920 --> 15:23.500
You can see this is going to fall to the next line with the flex wrap probably.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.240
Right.

15:24.250 --> 15:28.990
And this is going to be it for this number and next section are going to be creating a banner.
