A very useful element in the email is onward lists and order list.

00:06.870 --> 00:11.650
Now how do we create on our lists and order lists in the HMO.

00:11.650 --> 00:16.500
Well first of all we would need again the element and the natural element named 40 on our list would

00:16.500 --> 00:17.870
be you well.

00:18.090 --> 00:19.000
And sure enough right.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.780
Now I have my own short list.

00:20.830 --> 00:26.090
Or if I would want to have some kind of items within the honour list I would need to use the airline

00:26.160 --> 00:27.150
element.

00:27.150 --> 00:29.940
So the syntax will be for on our list.

00:29.940 --> 00:36.020
We would have the honor list element and then each and every element within this on our list will gonna

00:36.030 --> 00:37.480
have the airline element.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.800
And here we can write whatever you like.

00:39.800 --> 00:45.240
So let's say we'll just gonna have some kind of name and I have right now on the list item with this

00:45.240 --> 00:48.930
Bolton point shown as the list item.

00:48.930 --> 00:53.440
Now if I would like to copy and paste them so let's say I'm going to create more.

00:53.490 --> 00:55.560
Second one is gonna be Peter.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.210
Third one is gonna be Sarah.

00:58.470 --> 01:03.320
I'm gonna have these three list items displayed as on order list.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.780
Now the question would be well where are we gonna use the list.

01:07.380 --> 01:12.900
Well the biggest one where we always use the unknown list would be for navigation.

01:12.900 --> 01:18.060
So for now so we only have the about page but imagine that we're gonna have multiple pages.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.040
We can just place our links here.

01:20.040 --> 01:27.050
So either we can create a new one or I can just delete these guys and say Let's delete Peter.

01:27.210 --> 01:34.080
Let's also delete Sarah and within the list item within the list instead of placing some kind of text

01:34.440 --> 01:35.660
we can place a link.

01:35.730 --> 01:42.450
No again I'm gonna use just an empty link more damning Alec and let's write him home then let's grab

01:42.450 --> 01:48.990
this link and let's just copy and paste it within the next two list items and let's just write over

01:48.990 --> 01:56.640
here about as well as I had no contact would be our third one since we do have the about maybe we can

01:56.640 --> 02:01.800
also write about but I'm not going to navigate there again we already covered this with the links now

02:01.800 --> 02:05.120
the more we save this notice we have our navigation.

02:05.220 --> 02:10.360
Now obviously keep in mind we haven't had any kind of sea assessed yet.

02:10.410 --> 02:15.810
This is where the magic happens when we go to the sea assess and start styling but in general this would

02:15.810 --> 02:22.200
be our navigation where if I'm gonna click on it now obviously I'm going to go to the about page as

02:22.200 --> 02:27.150
well as I have the other links displayed as list items within my on order list.
