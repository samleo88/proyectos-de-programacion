00:00.390 --> 00:00.960
Awesome.

00:00.990 --> 00:04.440
We have successfully created our first home page.

00:04.440 --> 00:10.830
However we have a few more pages to go and the next one would be the belt page number four we start

00:10.860 --> 00:14.420
doing anything before we start creating the file or anything like that.

00:14.820 --> 00:15.810
Let's just check it out.

00:15.810 --> 00:20.900
What would be the common things between the one bridge as well as the above.

00:21.210 --> 00:27.710
So if I'm gonna open up the about page in the final project notice again the logo is gonna be here.

00:27.720 --> 00:34.630
We're also going to have our headings as well as our navigation and then the big background image.

00:34.650 --> 00:37.100
Now I keep calling this the background image of course.

00:37.110 --> 00:42.600
This is just one big image but later on as we're working with the RSS we're gonna be setting this up

00:42.630 --> 00:43.640
as a background image.

00:43.650 --> 00:50.350
So my apologies for now it's just one big image but I keep referring to as one big background.

00:50.460 --> 00:52.790
Now we also gonna have one.

00:52.800 --> 00:59.310
Well then there's gonna be specific text for the about page but then the footer as well as link back

00:59.310 --> 01:00.860
to the top is gonna stay the same.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.350
So we have two options.

01:03.540 --> 01:09.720
Either we can create a new file and start creating everything from scratch or we can just copy and paste

01:09.720 --> 01:15.260
everything that we have in the annexation email and delete unnecessary stuff.

01:15.270 --> 01:21.370
Now let's say first I would like to create a new file and let's call this about the email again since

01:21.410 --> 01:23.770
this would be in the H name home page.

01:23.850 --> 01:29.100
We need to use the agency email extension now within the file I would like to copy and paste everything

01:29.100 --> 01:30.100
that I have here.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.690
So I'm gonna select everything with Commander.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.630
Then we're gonna copy this by with command C as well as last but not least would like to paste this

01:39.990 --> 01:41.360
with command V.

01:41.910 --> 01:45.060
And now I have my index page in my about page.

01:45.670 --> 01:48.450
However this is where we're gonna start making changes.

01:48.450 --> 01:56.600
So first for the title maybe let's write that about page or just in general about and as well as for

01:56.600 --> 02:03.050
the heading I would like to change it from coffee junky to about now what else.

02:03.050 --> 02:04.880
Well the image is gonna stay right.

02:05.060 --> 02:08.840
However the feature product is gonna be about us.

02:08.840 --> 02:11.950
So the text here is gonna be about us.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.870
Is that a feature page.

02:13.870 --> 02:14.720
Now.

02:14.800 --> 02:20.240
We're gonna start deleting everything so I would like to delete all these featured items so everything

02:20.240 --> 02:24.280
starting from the house blend and ending with Colombian roast.

02:24.470 --> 02:25.980
I'm just gonna delete this.

02:26.060 --> 02:29.540
So first of all we can save this and let's see what we're gonna have.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.020
Now this is gonna be my home page.

02:31.020 --> 02:38.290
However now I can navigate my about page and what do we have is a logo the navigation like we wanted

02:38.300 --> 02:47.150
to as well as the big image and then we have just some herring with the virus and at the very bottom

02:47.150 --> 02:54.670
we have a paragraph with copyright and link back to the top so all this is working now the last thing

02:54.670 --> 03:00.760
that we would want in the about page is just to have the paragraph with let's say 500 words.

03:00.760 --> 03:05.940
So we're going to create a pair of tags and we're gonna paste or you know what not based.

03:05.950 --> 03:11.030
We obviously need to look for them and so we have Lorem five hundred and then we're looking for five

03:11.030 --> 03:14.080
hundred words now a moment we're gonna save it.

03:14.080 --> 03:19.810
These are going to be 500 words and again as always we can check it out how it looks like in the bigger

03:19.810 --> 03:20.870
browser window.

03:20.980 --> 03:22.860
So this for now would be the logo.

03:23.020 --> 03:24.790
I mean sorry index page.

03:24.910 --> 03:26.530
So this would be an exception email.

03:26.860 --> 03:34.180
And then as we hover or as we navigate to about 8 email then we're gonna have our heading with our big

03:34.180 --> 03:38.860
text and successfully we also have created our about page.
