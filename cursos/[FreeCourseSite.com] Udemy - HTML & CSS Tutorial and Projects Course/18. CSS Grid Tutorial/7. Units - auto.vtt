00:00.180 --> 00:05.450
And our next topic is going to be what kind of units we can use words here says Green.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.890
Now please keep in mind when we talk about units we are talking about the pros as well.

00:10.890 --> 00:16.440
Now I know we haven't covered drones yet essentially how to set up the rules but just please keep in

00:16.440 --> 00:23.220
mind whatever units we are going to cover with a columns the same ones we can use in fact as well with

00:23.220 --> 00:24.010
the ropes.

00:24.060 --> 00:26.630
Now first and foremost we obviously can use pixels.

00:26.760 --> 00:32.490
We can already clear we see that where let's say we have three column layout and all of them have been

00:32.490 --> 00:34.370
set up using pixels.

00:34.380 --> 00:38.070
Now we also have an optional ram an E M.

00:38.130 --> 00:48.210
So if I'm going to change this to let's say seven RAM and 10 even you're going to notice that I'm still

00:48.210 --> 00:50.180
going to have my grid.

00:50.550 --> 00:56.880
Now my columns are obviously smaller because these values are smaller but nothing broke and everything

00:56.880 --> 00:58.620
works still correctly.

00:58.620 --> 01:04.920
Now we also have an option of percentages and since we have the implicit grid can just keep on creating

01:04.920 --> 01:07.220
columns as would like.

01:07.290 --> 01:09.200
So let's add a 5 percent.

01:09.210 --> 01:11.790
And sure enough that is going to be my fourth column.

01:11.970 --> 01:17.230
Now since I only have seven items now of course I have this space blank.

01:17.790 --> 01:20.930
And then we have auto and fraction.

01:21.090 --> 01:24.000
Now these ones are very important because they are responsive.

01:24.420 --> 01:31.770
Now I'm going to leave off the fraction for a simple reason that most likely this is going to be your

01:31.770 --> 01:33.590
most used unit.

01:33.750 --> 01:39.120
And I would like to cover it in a bigger detail as well as that is something probably that you see for

01:39.120 --> 01:42.560
the first time so I would like to spend the whole video on that.

01:42.560 --> 01:42.830
All right.

01:43.200 --> 01:49.020
But let's look at the auto and how the fact that auto is responsive really helps us.

01:49.530 --> 01:55.270
So let's imagine this case where again you can just leave these seven ram or something like that but

01:55.290 --> 01:57.320
I'm going to go back to a three column layout.

01:57.720 --> 02:01.870
So if I'm going to add let's say auto right here.

02:01.980 --> 02:05.570
Notice how my third column is in fact responsive.

02:05.940 --> 02:12.420
So the moment the screen size gets smaller while this particular column gets smaller the moment the

02:12.420 --> 02:14.400
actual screen size is bigger.

02:14.400 --> 02:22.400
Well our column also gets bigger so you get an idea if you'd like to have some kind of column let's

02:22.410 --> 02:28.110
say one of them or maybe all of them and we would want them to be responsive where their width is in

02:28.110 --> 02:30.240
fact changing together with the screen size.

02:30.420 --> 02:37.890
We can definitely use the auto when we're setting up whether that is the role or in fact a column.
