Hey guys, the last part of requests
package that we're going to be

2

00:00:04,350  -->  00:00:09,660
discussing is the headers. So, we've been
sending very few headers here and

3

00:00:09,660  -->  00:00:14,130
there's actually quite a few more you
can send. If you're not familiar with

4

00:00:14,130  -->  00:00:16,800
headers i recommend reading up on them,

5

00:00:16,800  -->  00:00:22,380
there's a lot of different ways you can
spoof rendering engines and browsers if

6

00:00:22,380  -->  00:00:27,420
you need to, you can spoof quite a bit of
information, or just configure the post

7

00:00:27,420  -->  00:00:32,099
request or get request to how it needs
to be sent by using headers, but we

8

00:00:32,099  -->  00:00:36,329
didn't discuss is actually how to get
headers back and how to look at those. So,

9

00:00:36,329  -->  00:00:40,680
basically it's really simple you just
print out or do whatever you want with

10

00:00:40,680  -->  00:00:45,030
the request object at the headers
property.

11

00:00:45,030  -->  00:00:50,399
So let's go ahead and save this and run
this again, and you'll see that we've got

12

00:00:50,399  -->  00:00:56,640
quite a few headers sent back from the
server. So, max-age=0, Transfer Encoding,

13

00:00:56,640  -->  00:01:00,660
chunked, etc., and if this is all
gibberish to you that's ok, that's not

14

00:01:00,660  -->  00:01:05,460
really what we're focusing on, but if you
do need it then it's all right there if

15

00:01:05,460  -->  00:01:08,729
you want to debug some stuff, or if you
just want to capture it save it

16

00:01:08,729  -->  00:01:09,229
somewhere.
