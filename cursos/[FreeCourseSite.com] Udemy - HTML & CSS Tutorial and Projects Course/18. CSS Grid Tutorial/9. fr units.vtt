00:00.300 --> 00:07.230
Once we have covered CSX grid columns as well as CSX grid growth why don't we take a look at the new

00:07.230 --> 00:16.300
shiny tool that is at our disposal by the name of fraction units and how they in fact simplify our life.

00:16.380 --> 00:22.320
So let's say we have a three column layer and I would like to keep it that way or I would want to have

00:22.710 --> 00:25.170
all my columns to be equal size.

00:25.230 --> 00:28.940
So when we could do is start testing out these fraction units.

00:29.340 --> 00:33.900
So in this case what I'm going to do is I'm just going to delete all of them and let's start writing

00:33.900 --> 00:40.450
them and first and foremost I'm going to create a one column layout using one fraction.

00:40.570 --> 00:45.830
So what means is the fraction is the fraction of available space.

00:46.170 --> 00:53.340
So in my case since I have a one column layout that available space is in fact counter percent of my

00:53.340 --> 00:54.290
container.

00:54.330 --> 01:02.580
However if let's say we're going to have a two column land no notice now one fraction is in fact equal

01:02.580 --> 01:06.810
to a 50 percent of my hundred percent correct.

01:06.810 --> 01:11.010
Because that is the fraction of my available space.

01:11.010 --> 01:11.950
So let's save it.

01:12.060 --> 01:12.770
And notice.

01:12.870 --> 01:13.710
There you go.

01:13.740 --> 01:17.280
We have two equally sized columns.

01:17.340 --> 01:24.510
Now let's say I'm going to decide that you know what from my available space to fractions of that space

01:24.600 --> 01:30.000
I would like to use for my first column and then only one fraction I would like to use it for my second

01:30.000 --> 01:30.840
column.

01:30.840 --> 01:31.670
There you go.

01:31.740 --> 01:36.350
My first column right now is using two fractions of the available space.

01:36.480 --> 01:43.260
And then of course my second row is or I'm sorry a second column is using in fact only one fraction

01:43.580 --> 01:49.320
and this of course could be changed I could say let's say five fractions and then of course my first

01:49.320 --> 01:54.380
column is getting bigger and hopefully you get an idea where were the fractions.

01:54.410 --> 02:00.570
We're just specifically saying well what would be the space we would like to use for that particular

02:00.570 --> 02:04.100
column or that row from the available space.

02:04.410 --> 02:08.640
So the same would work if let's say I would want to have a three column land.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.560
The only thing I'm doing is you know what.

02:10.630 --> 02:14.310
Get me three equally sized columns.

02:14.340 --> 02:19.320
So for each of them we're going to use a one fraction of available space.

02:19.320 --> 02:24.040
So if my available space is going to be bigger well then my columns are going to be bigger.

02:24.210 --> 02:30.300
If my available space is going to be smaller we'll notice of course our columns are also going to be

02:30.300 --> 02:30.920
smaller.

02:30.980 --> 02:35.950
So as you can see it is a responsive value that is not a absolute value.

02:36.240 --> 02:41.010
And of course we could do the same thing of course as we are working with arrows.

02:41.160 --> 02:47.990
Now just to you that we can say you know what first row is going to be one fraction like so on orders.

02:48.010 --> 02:55.540
It uses all the space then it has this five arms and then of course we have our implicit order but could

02:55.540 --> 03:02.440
do exactly the same I can say one fraction one fraction and then of course we have a nice tile layout

03:02.860 --> 03:11.260
where not only we're using the evenly spaced out columns or with we're also using evenly nicely spaced

03:11.320 --> 03:14.200
out rows for our height.

03:14.740 --> 03:21.070
So that's the reason why most likely has you're going to be working with a CSX grid you're going to

03:21.070 --> 03:27.730
be reaching for this value because this gives you a very very nice layout without too much of a hassle

03:27.970 --> 03:30.240
or using any kind of math.

03:30.610 --> 03:35.860
So if you would want a four column layout of course the only thing you need is to add this particular

03:35.860 --> 03:36.680
fraction.

03:36.800 --> 03:42.490
Then if I would want let's say my second column to be bigger could add five fractions and hopefully

03:42.490 --> 03:46.170
you'd get an idea if let's say this guy would be three fractions.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.070
And I can go on and on and on.

03:48.340 --> 03:55.060
So we're going to be using our available space whether that's with more height and then we're just going

03:55.060 --> 03:57.820
to be dividing up in the fractions.
