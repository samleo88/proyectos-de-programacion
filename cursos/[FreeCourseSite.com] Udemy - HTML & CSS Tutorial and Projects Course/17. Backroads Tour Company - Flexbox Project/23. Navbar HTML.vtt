WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:03.650
And before we start working on Navarre why don't we check it out.

00:03.650 --> 00:06.730
What is going to be our end result.

00:07.230 --> 00:11.410
So first and foremost that is how our number is going to look.

00:11.430 --> 00:18.490
On a small screen size where there is going to be some kind of logo as well as button for the functionality.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.270
Then we're going to have our links.

00:21.270 --> 00:25.740
And then once we get to a bigger screen size then we're gonna have the logo.

00:25.840 --> 00:31.740
There is going to be no button for toggling in the links as links are going to be displayed in the center.

00:31.950 --> 00:37.390
And then all the way in right hand side we're going to have some social media icons.

00:37.650 --> 00:40.530
So that is our final product.

00:40.530 --> 00:42.090
Now why don't we start working on it.

00:42.150 --> 00:45.620
And first of all we're going to set up some H the email structure.

00:45.660 --> 00:52.650
Now I'm going to go back to for a few times because like I said I'd like to also in fact use the icons

00:52.680 --> 00:54.330
and links that I already have.

00:54.390 --> 00:59.760
We're just going to have to change some classes now as a side note when you're creating static pages

00:59.760 --> 01:01.250
like this with gestation amounts.

01:01.250 --> 01:01.710
Yes yes.

01:02.190 --> 01:04.620
Unfortunately that's how you're going to have to do it.

01:04.980 --> 01:11.880
So even though you have already let's say links as well as these social media icons if you want them

01:11.880 --> 01:14.950
in a different place you also need to copy and paste them.

01:15.090 --> 01:20.610
Once you start working with templating engines once you start working with BHP once you start working

01:20.610 --> 01:27.780
with react there is of course ways how you can just create that particular item element or component

01:27.780 --> 01:31.740
in one place and then reuse it all throughout your document.

01:31.740 --> 01:36.990
Now since we're just creating static pages using actually amounts to assess unfortunately we're going

01:36.990 --> 01:38.970
to have to do some copying pasting.

01:39.150 --> 01:40.580
Now not the biggest fan of that.

01:40.590 --> 01:47.150
But again it just makes a little bit more sense instead of just re typing everything from the scratch.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.940
Right now we have our NAV.

01:49.110 --> 01:54.930
First of all I would like to add a class here some say class is going to be a nav bar.

01:54.930 --> 02:00.120
And by the way we needed to scroll up all the way to the header and then within the header we already

02:00.120 --> 02:01.070
had a hero.

02:01.290 --> 02:03.900
But now we're going to add our NAV bar.

02:04.440 --> 02:09.700
Then let's create a deal with a class of NAV center.

02:10.200 --> 02:14.400
Now within this nerve center there's going to be few things that we're going to create.

02:14.460 --> 02:16.820
First I'm going to worry about that header.

02:16.830 --> 02:18.670
Now what do I mean by header.

02:18.750 --> 02:24.280
So first of all let me make again the smaller because I just want to show you header specifically.

02:24.280 --> 02:30.890
And as far as header is concerned it is going to be my logo here as well as my little icon.

02:31.080 --> 02:36.090
Now icon is gonna be the buttons so I'm gonna set up the button and place the icon within.

02:36.090 --> 02:39.660
But that is the header and that is what I mean by header.

02:39.670 --> 02:49.770
Now let's create a div Nav Error and you know what I am going to add here a Nav Error comment because

02:49.770 --> 02:56.040
there's gonna be a nav links as well as now icons like I said let's first start by getting the image

02:56.400 --> 03:02.160
and the image is sitting within the images and then we have logo switching manage the image that I'm

03:02.160 --> 03:07.960
using and I would like to add some class of nav logo.

03:08.250 --> 03:13.780
As far as alternative let's write back roads.

03:14.040 --> 03:20.520
I don't know company something like that and then also like I said there's gonna be an image but also

03:20.580 --> 03:21.630
a button.

03:21.630 --> 03:28.240
So why don't we add a button then for the type we're going to go with type of button.

03:28.440 --> 03:33.540
And then within the button I would like to place my icon.

03:33.630 --> 03:40.760
So F yes if a barge OK now let's save it then we're going to have to add few things.

03:40.770 --> 03:48.660
Now let my local dev server to spin up for a while but I'm gonna add a few things here for my button.

03:48.690 --> 03:57.300
First of all I would like to add a class and the class is going to be a nav toggle and for some reason.

03:57.300 --> 03:57.760
OK.

03:57.780 --> 03:58.740
Now it works.

03:59.040 --> 04:04.170
Now toggle and also the idea is going to be nav toggle nav toggle.

04:04.170 --> 04:12.810
Now please guys if you're going to use my javascript and see as well I guess but it is very important

04:12.810 --> 04:18.030
for the javascript because CSX you're gonna be technically able to see right away if your classes are

04:18.030 --> 04:23.050
not working but I'm adding these ideas later on when we're going to use the javascript.

04:23.070 --> 04:25.530
Now if your values are gonna be different.

04:25.530 --> 04:30.050
Unfortunately even though you're going to copy and paste my code your code is not going to work.

04:30.240 --> 04:38.150
Even though code should work exactly the same but unless your naming is exactly the same as well the

04:38.160 --> 04:41.010
land code is not going to work.

04:41.610 --> 04:48.180
Now let's also add a Ariel label just because we have nothing inside the button anyway so let's write

04:48.240 --> 04:54.270
Ariel label and I'm just going to say nav tag or something like that.

04:54.270 --> 04:59.880
Now you notice something really interesting where I do have my logo and it is massive.

04:59.880 --> 05:02.030
It is just spanning all across.

05:02.040 --> 05:06.290
Now we're gonna fix that once we start working with CSX but I can give you right away.

05:06.360 --> 05:13.710
And the reason why it is doing that is because remember we set up all our images to be with a hundred

05:13.710 --> 05:14.360
percent.

05:14.610 --> 05:21.000
And in fact in order to fix it we're going to cover not selector in the CSX and that is very very interesting

05:21.000 --> 05:22.060
selector by the way.

05:22.290 --> 05:24.120
But don't be freaked out by this.

05:24.150 --> 05:31.290
This in fact is looking hundred percent because we set all our images to be hundred percent.

05:31.850 --> 05:36.020
Now header is done and that is great.

05:36.030 --> 05:38.580
That was our header and next went up.

05:38.580 --> 05:40.280
We're going to have the Mavericks.

05:40.290 --> 05:49.620
Now I'm gonna add one more comment and of NAV bar header and again please keep in mind your values for

05:49.620 --> 05:53.830
your ideas and let me just repeat one more time.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.060
Are gonna have to be exactly the same.

05:56.160 --> 06:04.430
Now I'm saying that because I think I messed it up a little but we're not only have nav toggle but also

06:04.450 --> 06:06.920
like to have the idea of not toggle.

06:07.020 --> 06:12.800
So let me add a d of NAV toggle.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.090
Let me save that.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.390
And that should work.

06:16.410 --> 06:24.030
Now I do have my handy right because again I repeat myself but we're gonna use it when we set up the

06:24.030 --> 06:27.650
functionality with JavaScript so we have end of header.

06:28.030 --> 06:28.390
Okay.

06:28.410 --> 06:29.820
That's number one.

06:29.820 --> 06:32.470
But now I'd like to work with links.

06:32.560 --> 06:36.170
Now I'd like to place all the links that I had here.

06:36.180 --> 06:40.850
Now remember though we already had those links within the footer.

06:40.890 --> 06:49.440
So what we're gonna do is again instead of just re typing everything I'm gonna grab this div first I'm

06:49.440 --> 06:57.540
gonna grab this div we're gonna head over back to the Navarre like so and then within the nav bar and

06:57.540 --> 07:05.280
have no header there's going to be an NAV bar links let's copy and paste it let's say and often have

07:05.280 --> 07:08.610
bar links and let's copy paste our footer links.

07:08.640 --> 07:14.240
Now first of all we need to change the classes so we don't want the styling that we had within the footer.

07:14.340 --> 07:16.990
So let's write here nav links.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.030
That's number one.

07:18.150 --> 07:24.870
But also let's add the idea for our jobs and functionality with a value of NAV links.

07:25.530 --> 07:28.270
Now the H riff stays the same.

07:28.470 --> 07:30.330
So that doesn't change.

07:30.510 --> 07:34.280
However what I would like to change is here this footer link.

07:34.380 --> 07:38.430
So again let's select all of them by using multiple cursors.

07:38.430 --> 07:44.790
So again we're pressing out and the mouse and then let's write here have nav link.

07:44.790 --> 07:50.220
Now later on we're gonna add one more class for JavaScript functionality for the scrolling.

07:50.550 --> 07:53.430
But again we don't have to worry about her right now.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.450
We have our setup right.

07:55.800 --> 08:01.440
And technically once you press on services you're going to navigate to services so everything works

08:01.440 --> 08:03.090
really really well.

08:03.090 --> 08:07.800
But lastly I would like to add in fact my social media icons.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.010
So let me add one more comment.

08:10.020 --> 08:19.020
Now have social media icons like so and like I said we're gonna have to head over back to the footer

08:20.080 --> 08:24.760
for her and then within the firm by the way that's the wrong footer.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.900
That's not where I would want to go.

08:27.070 --> 08:30.370
And for some reason is not going to the football where I was looking for.

08:30.540 --> 08:33.610
Hour now it is it's just it's taking its time.

08:33.610 --> 08:37.390
So let's get footer icons.

08:37.960 --> 08:42.650
Let's grab this div so everything that we had here.

08:43.060 --> 08:47.360
Let's grab that and again let's navigate back to the number.

08:47.410 --> 08:53.920
In this case I'm just going to navigate with the cursor and we're going to head over to our links.

08:53.920 --> 09:01.930
Social media icons and then again let's copy paste it and let's change the class where it's not going

09:01.930 --> 09:04.000
to be a photo or icons.

09:04.090 --> 09:10.750
We're gonna name the NAV icons and then each and every icon is also going to be a nav icon.

09:10.930 --> 09:15.750
So let's set this up let's have a nav icon.

09:15.860 --> 09:16.800
Let's save it.

09:16.940 --> 09:19.250
And that should be our basic structure.

09:19.280 --> 09:26.180
So as you see we have quite a bit of sea assets to do in order to get our Navarre looking like that

09:26.180 --> 09:27.390
on a smaller screen.

09:27.440 --> 09:31.330
And then of course this particular layout on a bigger screen size.

09:31.340 --> 09:34.820
But no worries we're going to get there in no time.
