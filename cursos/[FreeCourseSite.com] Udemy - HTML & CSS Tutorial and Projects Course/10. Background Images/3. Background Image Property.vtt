WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:01.710
All righty neighbor.

00:01.720 --> 00:04.570
Hopefully you have the same setup as me.

00:04.570 --> 00:10.360
Whether you download it whether you fall along Glass video and now it can start working on the background

00:10.360 --> 00:12.460
property for our images.

00:12.520 --> 00:17.350
Now first and foremost in the indexation demo we're going gonna create a div.

00:17.350 --> 00:21.130
Now this div is going to have a class on the class.

00:21.130 --> 00:22.150
It's gonna be big.

00:22.150 --> 00:24.490
I am G and within this day.

00:24.520 --> 00:31.620
Let's say that there is going to be just some hiring one with IBM IBM.

00:31.690 --> 00:36.020
Let me make this proper one IBM big image.

00:36.090 --> 00:37.940
Now let me copy and paste this.

00:38.020 --> 00:40.740
Let's say one two three.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.650
Then the second one is gonna be small.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.420
So if it's a small image.

00:45.550 --> 00:50.350
The third one is gonna be the folder image again kind of straightforward.

00:50.350 --> 00:54.010
This is gonna be the small image and you probably really you can guess what we're going to be doing

00:54.010 --> 00:54.860
anyway.

00:54.940 --> 00:59.080
So it's a small image and then the last one is gonna be the holder image.

00:59.110 --> 01:01.870
So I am all their image.

01:01.870 --> 01:03.330
Nice to meet you.

01:03.700 --> 01:05.230
Indexation Actually I'm all done.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.220
Awesome.

01:06.220 --> 01:11.870
Let's head over to styles assess first let's select all the divs and let's say the divs are not gonna

01:11.890 --> 01:17.840
have any kind of with so they're gonna be spanning all across but we all gonna add some height so let's

01:17.840 --> 01:24.700
say height is not gonna be two pixels I'd actually would be I don't know let's start out by four hundred

01:24.700 --> 01:31.090
pixels I think that's gonna be a little bit too drastic here let's cover 300 pixels maybe that's gonna

01:31.090 --> 01:31.860
be bigger.

01:32.020 --> 01:34.780
Well at the moment it's still kind of big but you know what.

01:34.780 --> 01:41.580
It's obviously the fact that I'm working with the browser window and I have zoomed in a lot so not there

01:41.790 --> 01:46.960
I'm gonna zoom in there but zoom out over here because I always want you to see a little bit better

01:46.960 --> 01:52.020
so I can see that I kind of went a little bit drastic where I had one seventy five.

01:52.030 --> 02:01.390
So in this case it looks better with 125 so now I may be I can not really get 400 knot not 54000 more

02:01.410 --> 02:03.990
5400 let's try 400.

02:04.150 --> 02:06.130
Yeah and I think this is gonna do the job.

02:06.130 --> 02:06.990
Excellent.

02:07.150 --> 02:08.870
Also liked the color.

02:08.950 --> 02:11.840
So let's right color is going to be red.

02:11.950 --> 02:13.180
Let's save it.

02:13.240 --> 02:14.630
So far so good.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.570
Now let's start working with the backgrounds.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.860
Now we have done already too many times the background property.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.760
So I'm going to show you with a color.

02:21.760 --> 02:26.670
However the whole point here is to show you can work with images.

02:26.710 --> 02:31.860
So for the class of big image what I would like first of all it's like like the background.

02:32.060 --> 02:36.850
That's gonna be the first step then for the background the value in this case is going to be U.R.L.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.090
and this is where the difference comes in.

02:39.190 --> 02:45.160
We're not placing the color we are writing the URL now within the URL we need to show the path.

02:45.270 --> 02:50.690
So where this image is located now where is this image located the big image.

02:50.700 --> 02:54.730
Well it's in exactly the same folder as our style CSF.

02:54.760 --> 02:59.740
So it's very simply we can just look for the big image that I'm gonna do in the forward slash.

02:59.740 --> 03:02.150
And in this case this would be the big image.

03:02.170 --> 03:06.690
Now it can also let me just save it first of all just so you can see that there's going to be an image.

03:07.090 --> 03:09.460
But let's look at the other options we had.

03:09.670 --> 03:12.850
We obviously could have done it like this would have set it like this.

03:12.850 --> 03:14.320
This would still going to work.

03:14.320 --> 03:19.270
But again please remember it's going to depend whether you're opening up with the browser.

03:19.270 --> 03:24.130
So if we're gonna go over here and if you're going to click on let's say indexation the amount then

03:24.520 --> 03:29.650
the different paths are going to mess up over there as your opening directly in the browser.

03:29.650 --> 03:30.820
So just keep in that mind.

03:30.850 --> 03:36.040
So this is gonna be the safe one where even though I'm going to open up where the browser directly this

03:36.040 --> 03:37.100
is still gonna work.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.950
So again this is just something you need to keep an eye on.

03:40.060 --> 03:41.800
Now I'd say this again.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.180
And what else we have.

03:43.360 --> 03:48.010
Well maybe let's just get out like this and say Big J Peg.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.510
Now is this working.

03:49.600 --> 03:50.810
I think it is.

03:50.890 --> 03:52.690
Again we can do the same thing you know what.

03:52.750 --> 03:58.100
Let me open up the new browser window and we're going to cover everything that we again did in the annexation

03:58.100 --> 03:58.860
email.

03:58.920 --> 04:00.130
So let me open this up.

04:00.160 --> 04:05.290
So this one is working right now then let's do this guy.

04:05.840 --> 04:11.240
When we had the quotation marks and I'm sorry if you already know this or it's annoying to you so it

04:11.240 --> 04:17.540
would be showing here on my life server but if I'm gonna refresh it's not going to be working here as

04:17.540 --> 04:20.570
I woke up this directly with the browser window.

04:20.570 --> 04:26.540
So again this is something we already covered with the indexation email where we had the relative path

04:26.960 --> 04:31.940
but this is something that we're going to work with the browsers as well as with development servers

04:32.360 --> 04:36.030
and this is the syntax that you'll use a lot.

04:36.080 --> 04:40.550
Whether that's going to be I can react or note or something like this again I digress.

04:40.550 --> 04:46.190
But it can sometimes really throw you off if you're just messing around and if you're not getting the

04:46.250 --> 04:47.300
correct values.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.310
So for me I'm just gonna be sticking with this whatever you pick.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.630
It's really up to you.

04:51.650 --> 04:57.980
OK we have the background now with all my yammering about the actual path.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.500
I didn't tell you that basically we're getting the image.

05:00.500 --> 05:06.050
So that's the neat part where we have the background right now and the background is in fact image.

05:06.140 --> 05:09.920
If I'm going to make this bigger still notice we're gonna have the nice image.

05:09.920 --> 05:14.450
Now there's gonna be a couple of things that are happening by default and that is something we'd see

05:14.450 --> 05:19.820
assess where some of the things you already have noticed like let's say display properties they already

05:19.820 --> 05:20.740
preset.

05:20.740 --> 05:26.270
Now one of the things that we're going to again cover in a few videos is the fact that this is repeating

05:26.870 --> 05:28.100
the background image.

05:28.250 --> 05:33.020
It fits one if the div is getting bigger it needs to fit another one.

05:33.050 --> 05:34.830
This is gonna be repeating again.

05:34.910 --> 05:36.530
We're not going to cover this right now.

05:36.530 --> 05:41.630
We're just checking how this would look in general then let's do small image.

05:41.630 --> 05:43.270
Remember that was the other one.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.390
And again you know what.

05:44.390 --> 05:46.280
In this case maybe let's just copy and paste it.

05:46.810 --> 05:53.630
There is no reasoning for me to not copy and paste it because I think it's gonna save us a little bit

05:53.630 --> 05:54.470
of time.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.050
So it's a small image.

05:57.050 --> 06:00.680
So I'm going to be looking for the small guy and check this out.

06:00.910 --> 06:03.990
So I'm gonna change this again is in the same folder.

06:03.990 --> 06:04.540
So I don't care.

06:04.570 --> 06:11.840
I can just use small JPEG and what do we see or hear or we see that literally the image is repeated

06:12.170 --> 06:15.770
not only the x direction but as well by direction.

06:15.770 --> 06:18.290
Again that is something that's happening by default.

06:18.290 --> 06:25.130
So it will gonna matter what kind of image you're making because I'm sorry using because the reason

06:25.190 --> 06:30.950
why I wanted to show the small image is that even though we were going to cover lay around the properties

06:30.950 --> 06:32.190
that affect this.

06:32.240 --> 06:37.930
So technically we could get the same look where the small image is still gonna be covering a whole day

06:37.930 --> 06:41.360
of it is gonna be distorted and it's not going to be very pretty.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.630
So it does matter what kind of image you're picking.

06:43.640 --> 06:48.710
So please don't pick like an image of twenty five and twenty five and then wonder well why my image

06:48.710 --> 06:51.220
looks so bad or why does it doing this repetition.

06:51.230 --> 06:57.080
Because that is something that's happening by default and I know that's quite a lot that you kind of

06:57.080 --> 06:58.640
have to remember that.

06:58.700 --> 06:59.090
OK.

06:59.090 --> 07:01.120
The display properties by default.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.250
This is by default but there's nothing I can do.

07:04.310 --> 07:05.720
Just this is how it is.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.310
Here it is happening by default.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.660
And I just need to cover it.

07:09.080 --> 07:14.950
Now last one is gonna be folded image successfully or happily that was the big one.

07:15.130 --> 07:20.870
Let's say small and I don't know why the deleted image could have just said with folder.

07:20.870 --> 07:23.270
Now I don't want to use the small one.

07:23.270 --> 07:25.080
Now I have to look in the folder.

07:25.220 --> 07:29.860
Now the reason here again wants to show you that we need to use the path.

07:30.350 --> 07:33.890
So we have to use the path where we're looking for the images.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.070
Then with the images what we have.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.510
Well we have folder image.

07:38.510 --> 07:40.130
Now we were successful.

07:40.130 --> 07:41.610
And now I'm getting the folder image.

07:42.290 --> 07:43.760
So big takeaways.

07:43.760 --> 07:48.860
If you want to place an image use the background property that we already have covered many times with

07:48.860 --> 07:54.400
the colours then use the URL and then within the URL knee you need to get an image.

07:54.890 --> 08:01.940
But please understand that the image you're picking matters because the small image is gonna be repeated.
