00:00.360 --> 00:03.610
Next movie let's cover properties that we're going to use our texts.

00:03.690 --> 00:09.870
But since I don't want to cram them in one video I'm going to spread them out either to properties that

00:09.870 --> 00:11.940
one video or maybe three.

00:11.940 --> 00:12.630
Let's see.

00:12.830 --> 00:15.770
And we're gonna start with font weight and file style.

00:15.930 --> 00:22.340
Now as a side note though I would just want to show you that wherever generic family kicks in.

00:22.440 --> 00:26.810
Now if we're gonna head over to our import manifolds is gonna come this out.

00:27.120 --> 00:30.670
Notice that we're still gonna get the generic on families.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.990
So some kind of fans from the generic fund family.

00:34.050 --> 00:37.620
If we have cursive This is the reason why this is gonna look like this.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.310
And then for a bottle we're getting sensor.

00:40.410 --> 00:47.850
So here you can see actually the generic families in the work where we have commented this out.

00:47.850 --> 00:54.540
So obviously the browser cannot find this rubato but then it finds something that is at least close

00:54.540 --> 00:56.370
to that from the sensor.

00:56.460 --> 00:57.540
Generic font family.

00:58.290 --> 01:01.600
So in a nutshell that is how the generic font family would work.

01:02.250 --> 01:06.140
Now again maybe let's comment this out more.

01:06.180 --> 01:08.550
Let me just make this reasonable.

01:08.550 --> 01:09.420
Let me say it.

01:09.440 --> 01:14.590
And now I have both of different families and I'm gonna head over back to head one.

01:15.170 --> 01:20.790
And I'm just gonna say first of all that I would want to have some class some say Maine and you know

01:20.790 --> 01:25.840
what I would like to add some more things here and maybe change around the paragraph.

01:26.340 --> 01:32.040
So first I'm gonna say for the paragraph I'm gonna say some law I'm 25 so I'm going to have a little

01:32.040 --> 01:33.170
bit less text.

01:33.350 --> 01:35.900
However I would want to have an understanding one.

01:35.910 --> 01:40.940
So this is gonna be a let's say subheading AND I'M NOT GONNA ADD right now maybe.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.780
Or you know what I should probably.

01:42.780 --> 01:43.800
So let's right.

01:43.800 --> 01:50.060
Class of subheading as well just so we can test different things and we're gonna do another one under

01:50.060 --> 01:53.640
a paragraph we as law I'm off guess twenty five.

01:54.110 --> 01:55.370
Now I'm gonna say it.

01:55.380 --> 02:00.330
So I have two subheadings obviously because they're hiding ones and then both of them have this kind

02:00.330 --> 02:01.380
of fun.

02:01.410 --> 02:06.930
Now if we're gonna go over to styles to assess I would like to change this and I'm going to say that

02:06.970 --> 02:10.050
this family is only going to be for the main one.

02:10.290 --> 02:17.340
The moment I say it obviously list one family's applied with the first one because the other one has

02:17.340 --> 02:21.990
the class of subheading now where the font weight comes in and what does it do.

02:22.020 --> 02:25.500
Well it just makes our font bolder.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.300
How do how would that work.

02:27.330 --> 02:33.500
Let's say for the body we're gonna go with font family and then we're looking for these guys.

02:33.600 --> 02:38.910
So we have I'm sorry not found time we were looking for find weight and then we have bunch of numbers

02:38.910 --> 02:43.800
here also options of bold bolder and lighter.

02:43.800 --> 02:48.110
Now I can probably already tell you what they're gonna do.

02:48.300 --> 02:55.000
Bold is gonna make it bold bold there is gonna make it bolder and lighter is gonna make it lighter.

02:55.560 --> 03:01.830
These numbers here keep in mind that if you have an imported just because you're going to set something

03:01.830 --> 03:08.310
to 900 it's gonna default back to that 700 anyway so be careful about that don't think that just in

03:08.310 --> 03:11.980
case you're going to add 900 then this is gonna be definitely bolder.

03:12.170 --> 03:18.680
Now in order to show you that why don't we go to the paragraphs and add also some classes is that way

03:18.680 --> 03:20.630
we can be a little bit more specific.

03:20.690 --> 03:28.340
So this is gonna be paragraph number one as well as we're gonna do class of paragraph number two not

03:28.340 --> 03:36.870
very general names meaning not very original names but we're just gonna add a little bit of fun weight.

03:37.190 --> 03:40.490
So let's say for the paragraph number one we would want.

03:40.520 --> 03:47.050
I don't know font font weight is gonna be like I said let's try with 700 here.

03:47.350 --> 03:50.080
But that's gonna be the first one and notice it is right now.

03:50.090 --> 03:56.300
Boulder and let's try with number two we go for 900 just to kind of prove my point.

03:56.380 --> 04:02.330
Now again let me look for a proper family or sorry for a proper property some reason fund family stuck

04:02.330 --> 04:04.670
in my head and I cannot get it out.

04:04.670 --> 04:08.870
So what we have found way to 900 What do you think is going to happen.

04:08.870 --> 04:11.220
Do you think this is a really bolder than that.

04:11.270 --> 04:12.200
I don't think so.

04:12.200 --> 04:17.600
I think they're both exactly the same and now is that the reason for that is the max we have seen so

04:17.600 --> 04:18.330
far so good.

04:18.350 --> 04:23.660
Again we can do the same thing here we can say bold and let's say for this guy we're going to have Boulder

04:24.170 --> 04:28.460
again let's try it out and pretty much they both look the same.

04:29.270 --> 04:34.700
We have defined weight covered now so maybe look for lighter going to go lighter.

04:34.700 --> 04:41.510
Now obviously this is gonna fall back to 400 then we would also want to look at font style.

04:41.840 --> 04:45.510
Now for the font style let's go with font style.

04:45.590 --> 04:53.150
And here we have few options we have again the initial inherit and then we're looking for italic normal

04:53.270 --> 04:54.840
and oblique.

04:54.860 --> 04:56.660
Now we have the italic one.

04:56.990 --> 04:58.980
So this is going to look like this.

04:58.980 --> 05:01.390
Let's copy and paste the style.

05:01.400 --> 05:04.490
Let's say this guy wore number two.

05:04.640 --> 05:12.580
We're gonna add oblique make up and paste and list changes around and say Oh Blake over here.

05:12.690 --> 05:15.730
And again as you can see very very similar things.

05:15.950 --> 05:18.960
And maybe the last thing would we would want is check it out.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.780
What what else we have here.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.670
So for this I'm gonna do the subheading.

05:23.690 --> 05:27.470
We'll have a class office ring.

05:27.710 --> 05:33.080
And here I'm gonna be looking again for the font style and for the font style.

05:33.230 --> 05:34.460
What do we have.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.310
Well I believe we have the italic.

05:36.330 --> 05:40.020
Then we had the oblique and you know what let me get my suggestions.

05:40.100 --> 05:43.460
And again the suggestions was the control and space.

05:43.490 --> 05:48.050
And here I have the normal one Now your question probably will.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.590
Where are we going to try the normal ones.

05:50.760 --> 05:56.430
Now there's gonna be cases where you said something for let's say three paragraphs but one of them you

05:56.430 --> 05:59.250
would want the default setting.

05:59.250 --> 06:04.610
So in general you're not going to use this normal setting because this already comes by default and

06:04.610 --> 06:06.530
that's the reason why nothing changed there.

06:06.660 --> 06:11.230
But let's say for all the headings you have said some kind of style.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.690
Now what is going to happen.

06:12.690 --> 06:18.570
Well let's change this around let's say that I'm gonna get rid of the font style here as well as here

06:19.410 --> 06:21.700
and let me get rid of this guy.

06:21.700 --> 06:25.610
Number two I'm going to do it like this.

06:25.610 --> 06:26.600
Let me say it.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.900
That's gonna work now also.

06:29.150 --> 06:34.550
You know what I mean get rid of the italic ones but somewhere in the body what's right like this let's

06:34.550 --> 06:40.070
say found aren't here font and we're gonna write style.

06:40.260 --> 06:45.750
So for home my body I would want to let's say have italic on the moment I'm gonna say I would notice

06:45.750 --> 06:46.620
something interesting.

06:47.070 --> 06:53.460
So everything here turns italic because obviously this is the inheritance in the works we have the parent

06:53.460 --> 06:54.950
and we're just passing down this property.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.790
However let's say for this guy we would want only normal ones.

06:58.800 --> 07:03.000
And that's the reason why we would add normal and that is something that you are going to see a lot

07:03.660 --> 07:08.350
where meaning you're not going to use in maybe a lot but you'll see it a lot where if you were going

07:08.350 --> 07:14.150
to have those default properties like let's say there's gonna be text left.

07:14.250 --> 07:15.750
So text should be left.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.560
This is gonna be applied only if you're applying to multiple items.

07:19.560 --> 07:26.760
Let's say some kind of font style that would be italic but then you're gonna use the default one on

07:26.760 --> 07:29.550
some of the elements that you don't want to follow the same pattern.
