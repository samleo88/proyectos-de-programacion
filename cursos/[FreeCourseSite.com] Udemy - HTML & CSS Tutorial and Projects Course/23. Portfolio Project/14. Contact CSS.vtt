WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:04.710
So let's go to our success and actually start styling here.

00:04.740 --> 00:07.070
So I'm going to click on Main see assess.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.670
You can see that this was our last section.

00:09.670 --> 00:12.670
So this would be the End of Project or here.

00:12.870 --> 00:20.040
And once we have the End of Project or here we want to create a comment of contact here.

00:20.070 --> 00:23.290
Copy and paste the line here and end of contact.

00:23.430 --> 00:28.920
Now for the end of contact what we would want is we would first start with a contact section.

00:29.220 --> 00:33.320
So we're going to say only contact and over here we're going to do a background.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.630
Now for a background we're going to do more.

00:35.670 --> 00:37.910
I don't know where this is going to be s..

00:38.130 --> 00:40.780
So we're all going to say this will be a section.

00:40.950 --> 00:46.170
So again we're not going to be mixing actual gray color because just in case you would want to change

00:46.170 --> 00:50.660
the color note here again let's do the same thing let's do a thing.

00:50.900 --> 00:54.780
Now this is going to be three or Reems and zero.

00:55.050 --> 00:59.450
So really top bottom is going to be three and left or right is going to be zero.

00:59.740 --> 01:07.350
And after we have planning now I would want a contact or hire center and again for the centering we're

01:07.350 --> 01:11.520
going to do the same thing with the same max with is going to be 80.

01:11.510 --> 01:14.110
Are you with us or you doing this.

01:14.250 --> 01:17.700
And then we're going to have again a lot of margin for the margin.

01:17.690 --> 01:24.740
We're going to have two RPMs here or we're like this hour we're actually working with the center.

01:24.810 --> 01:30.870
You can see or hear now we have more margins once we're done with a contact center.

01:30.870 --> 01:33.420
Now what I would want is to work with this letter.

01:33.720 --> 01:37.980
Remember that this header is holding the name and holding that e-mail.

01:38.190 --> 01:45.290
And what we can do is we can create this a header as a flex box container so we're going to say contract

01:45.650 --> 01:48.720
to of course had her on here.

01:48.990 --> 01:56.700
How far ahead are you going to say first display flex like this so I can see that right away side by

01:56.700 --> 01:57.630
side.

01:57.630 --> 02:04.280
Then once we have the flex and we would want a justified content space between here.

02:04.470 --> 02:11.820
So basically push them as far as possible from each other and then we're going to have a flex ramp.

02:11.820 --> 02:17.420
So basically if the screen is going to get too small We're going to say that we would want a rapid.

02:17.580 --> 02:23.810
And also we would want a margin margin wouldn't be to RPMs and no one here zero.

02:23.820 --> 02:31.190
So basically still for the whole Hetter we were one margin but still would want these texts and input

02:31.280 --> 02:33.510
and email to look like this.

02:33.510 --> 02:37.810
So once we have our hand her and actually style all the inputs.

02:38.010 --> 02:45.590
So here we're going to say first contact name and we're going to have a contact via e-mail.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.240
So basically select them all.

02:47.260 --> 02:53.530
The last one is going to be contact and text text area or here like this.

02:53.650 --> 02:55.530
And what we would one for all.

02:55.780 --> 03:01.650
Well on here first we would want a background and we're going to say background is going to be transparent.

03:01.970 --> 03:08.820
Guess and I can see that we don't have that back and after that we would want a border and we were one

03:08.810 --> 03:09.910
border none.

03:09.960 --> 03:16.300
So basically border would disappear then we would want a border bottom here.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.520
And for the border bottom we're actually going to have a caller.

03:19.800 --> 03:25.260
So for the caller we're going to have three pixels solid and we're going to save our own here in this

03:25.260 --> 03:25.500
case.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.750
This is going to be dark like this so we sang it.

03:28.950 --> 03:29.480
You can see that.

03:29.480 --> 03:33.040
Now I have my waters in the bottom.

03:33.390 --> 03:37.880
So once we have the waters then we would want also a panning.

03:38.130 --> 03:43.460
So for the padding is going to be zero point two five RPMs and zero.

03:43.680 --> 03:53.430
So 0.05 bottom left and right zero margin is going to be to Reems zero here.

03:53.460 --> 04:00.120
So there's also going to be margin bottom but zero on the sides and or font size we're going to say

04:00.120 --> 04:02.810
1.2 rpms.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.290
So they're basically bigger font size.

04:05.580 --> 04:11.880
So this is how it's going to look like some of the ones we have styled and this actually work with a

04:11.880 --> 04:14.620
contact name and contact e-mail.

04:14.880 --> 04:23.880
So here I'm going to say contact on your two underscores name and that I also want a contact and e-mail.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.940
So I would want with them I would want to flex.

04:27.090 --> 04:33.640
So all here I'm going to say flex 00 Coke here Coke.

04:33.730 --> 04:40.260
And for the color we're going to say very easy we're going to say 50 percent minus one aria.

04:40.510 --> 04:43.120
So again we're making sure that there's going to be room.

04:43.330 --> 04:49.450
So basically as it gets to the bigger screen where it doesn't need to wrap you can see that it's going

04:49.450 --> 04:51.280
to be taking 50 percent.

04:51.280 --> 04:55.930
However there is going to be this one argument between two and this is all going to be working with

04:55.930 --> 04:56.730
him.

04:56.800 --> 05:03.610
Now once we have set the contact name and contact e-mail now we're going to do contact and we're going

05:03.610 --> 05:04.710
to say textarea.

05:04.990 --> 05:10.120
And for textarea I was going to say very simple and to say with and the with is actually going to be

05:10.120 --> 05:11.550
hundred percent money.

05:11.560 --> 05:16.840
So once we say you can see that all the time it's going to be taking all the space.

05:16.930 --> 05:23.230
Now the last one is actually going to be contact button or here we're going to say that for the contact

05:23.230 --> 05:33.010
button we would want a contact and we would want a beganto 200 course BGN and we're going to start with

05:33.010 --> 05:40.240
background var this is going to be a color wheel like this and this is would be the color for the button

05:40.770 --> 05:45.120
that we would want the actual color and the color is going to be light.

05:45.340 --> 05:52.180
So again we're going to do a wire and light here so this is going to be our light color over here.

05:52.210 --> 05:58.120
So once we have set the background there we would want a display of block.

05:58.120 --> 06:02.990
So basically I would want this button all the time to be in the next row.

06:03.220 --> 06:05.500
So that's why I'm using the display one.

06:05.800 --> 06:12.700
Then we're going to have a margin margin of 0 0 0 0 here because I actually want to place it in the

06:12.700 --> 06:13.530
center.

06:13.840 --> 06:19.320
Then we're going to do a planning 0.5 RPMs and 1 am.

06:19.510 --> 06:22.070
So I'm going to save it and it's going to look like this.

06:22.190 --> 06:25.550
Then we're going to have a margin on top.

06:25.690 --> 06:28.020
And this is going to be to our Reems.

06:28.080 --> 06:33.670
This is going to be the top margin then we can do a font size.

06:33.940 --> 06:38.510
And for the font size we're going to have 1.5 RPMs over here.

06:38.510 --> 06:46.220
So basically this is going to be bigger than LEDs do text transform and this is going to be uppercase

06:46.680 --> 06:51.500
it's going to make sure that the font is uppercase letter spacing.

06:51.560 --> 07:00.340
When I say 0.5 RPMs I miss so now our letters have more space in between.

07:00.530 --> 07:02.820
And then we're going to do a transition.

07:02.820 --> 07:10.080
So here we're going to say a transition this is going to be all zero point five seconds when you're

07:10.490 --> 07:12.840
this is going to be a linear transition.

07:12.980 --> 07:19.250
And like I said before basically what we're doing with transition and making sure that change is happening

07:19.520 --> 07:26.760
over time not right away because on here we're going to say a contact that will have a contact between

07:26.760 --> 07:28.040
and hover.

07:28.130 --> 07:30.930
So going to between and on here.

07:31.280 --> 07:37.370
So here we're going to say that we all want a background now the background is going to be lights are

07:38.090 --> 07:42.020
on here light right here and this is going to be our background.

07:42.030 --> 07:44.250
Then we also want a color.

07:44.510 --> 07:49.150
Now the color is actually going to be dark so boring and this is going to be dark color.

07:49.310 --> 07:50.540
So I will say this.

07:50.540 --> 07:51.100
Check it out.

07:51.100 --> 07:56.260
We have so right now as you can see the changes happening as I'm hovering over here.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.720
And the last one is actually going to be water.

07:59.960 --> 08:06.320
So here I'm going to say there's going to be a border and we would want basically bought a car.

08:06.410 --> 08:11.320
So if we want or here this morning we would just want a water cooler.

08:11.560 --> 08:15.590
So here say hair color I guess.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.840
And for the water we would want a dark color.

08:19.980 --> 08:23.860
So I more dark hair on this.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.590
So we're going to we need to go back here and have a dark.

08:28.160 --> 08:34.480
So I would say this you know here as I'm hovering You can see that right now I have my dark more.

08:34.640 --> 08:38.240
And once we have our border the last thing let's do the I.

08:38.270 --> 08:43.720
So here are going to just create a little bit more room here and you can see that I made the mistake.

08:43.730 --> 08:47.170
I need to create a curly braces.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.730
No let's do the icon.

08:48.910 --> 08:52.410
So we are going to say contact and let's do icon.

08:52.420 --> 08:57.060
So contact icon for the icon is going to be very straight forward.

08:57.200 --> 09:01.310
Well we're going to say well your margin will get a slim margin right.

09:01.500 --> 09:07.680
Is going to be zero point five rpms or so is going to create a little bit more room.

09:07.720 --> 09:10.100
So let's go ahead and let's actually check it out.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.790
We have with the S..

09:11.810 --> 09:14.340
So I'm going to go with the portfolio record.

09:14.410 --> 09:15.270
We're going to refresh.

09:15.330 --> 09:21.890
And this is how our contact action is going to work and once we're done with this section now we can

09:21.980 --> 09:23.600
go ahead and start working on it for.
