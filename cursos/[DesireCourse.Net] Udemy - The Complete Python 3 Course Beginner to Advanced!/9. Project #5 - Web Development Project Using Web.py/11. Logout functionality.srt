00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,259
Hey guys, in the last video we learned
about user management and session

2

00:00:04,259  -->  00:00:09,210
management, and we created our login
script which is fully functional to log

3

00:00:09,210  -->  00:00:15,330
a user in, however now we're going to
talk about logging a user out. It

4

00:00:15,330  -->  00:00:20,550
includes making some changes to our
program, including the logout function

5

00:00:20,550  -->  00:00:28,890
right here the class. So basically what
we need to do is we need to change, in

6

00:00:28,890  -->  00:00:33,870
our code we've been using this right
here to determine if a user is logged in

7

00:00:33,870  -->  00:00:40,469
or not, if user is logged in user becomes
the user object as defined down here.

8

00:00:41,040  -->  00:00:45,210
However, what we need to do, and we again we've been using this in all of our

9

00:00:45,210  -->  00:00:49,440
checks in our templates, what we need to
do is we need a way to reset this to

10

00:00:49,440  -->  00:00:53,969
a null value, and in python that null value
is just "None"

11

00:00:53,969  -->  00:01:00,930
it's a boolean operator. So, we're going
to set the initializer object to user is

12

00:01:00,930  -->  00:01:06,150
None, and then basically what we need to
do is down here, well first let's go

13

00:01:06,150  -->  00:01:12,720
through here, we need to manually check
now all of these instances "None" and change

14

00:01:12,720  -->  00:01:17,430
them "none", accordingly.

15

00:01:17,430  -->  00:01:22,799
Now, what I've added here in the main
layout is basically it's a very simple

16

00:01:22,799  -->  00:01:26,729
if statement that says, if session user
equals none

17

00:01:26,729  -->  00:01:30,630
meaning if the user is not logged in, we
want to provide them a login and

18

00:01:30,630  -->  00:01:31,920
register link,

19

00:01:31,920  -->  00:01:37,560
otherwise we need to provide them with a
logout link, and I've given this the ID

20

00:01:37,560  -->  00:01:40,409
of a logout link and you'll see why in
just a moment.

21

00:01:40,409  -->  00:01:46,590
Now this is not going to kill the
session automatically, what we need to do

22

00:01:46,590  -->  00:01:52,110
is we need to first clear out the user
object manually, and so we're going to go

23

00:01:52,110  -->  00:02:07,530
"session['user'] = None" and "session_data['user' = None]" and we're going to

24

00:02:07,530  -->  00:02:08,580
going to save this.

25

00:02:08,580  -->  00:02:13,560
We are also going to save our home
template and our main layout template,

26

00:02:13,560  -->  00:02:20,340
and now we're going to create the ajax
logout, and how we're going to do that is

27

00:02:20,340  -->  00:02:24,750
just add an "a" element here with an id of logout link, and we're going to be using this,

28

00:02:24,750  -->  00:02:29,040
this is going to be the event target. So
copy the ID and come over to scripty here,

29

00:02:29,040  -->  00:02:32,760
and what we're going to do is we're
going to just open up another event

30

00:02:32,760  -->  00:02:43,200
trigger. So "$(document)on('click', '#logout-link')" and that's going

31

00:02:43,200  -->  00:02:47,850
to result in the "function(e){ }" which we're
going to find next. We are going to pass

32

00:02:47,850  -->  00:02:58,200
the event to the function so that we can
do this "e.preventDefault( );" We don't want the default action

33

00:02:58,200  -->  00:03:04,830
of clicking on a link to have any impact
right now on this event. So what we need

34

00:03:04,830  -->  00:03:12,510
to do is we need to create an ajax
request to this url right here, so the

35

00:03:12,510  -->  00:03:25,530
log out page. Let's go ahead and "$.ajax({" "url: '/logout', type: 'GET',

36

00:03:25,530  -->  00:03:32,910
and when we use GET as a type for
an ajax request we actually don't even

37

00:03:32,910  -->  00:03:36,840
have to send any data, so what we're
going to do is move right on to the

38

00:03:36,840  -->  00:03:45,840
"success: function(res){ }" i'm going to be
capturing the response, and basically in

39

00:03:45,840  -->  00:03:51,780
the controller we've said to return
the word success, so that's what we're

40

00:03:51,780  -->  00:04:01,739
going to check now. So "if(res == 'success'){ }" we're just going to redirect

41

00:04:01,739  -->  00:04:06,330
them to the login page "window.location.href = '/login';"

42

00:04:09,460  -->  00:04:22,960
"else{" "alert("Something went wrong.");" there we go. Now we should all,

43

00:04:22,960  -->  00:04:28,390
we should have all the makings here for
a working login and logout system, so

44

00:04:28,390  -->  00:04:31,630
what we're going to do is I'm going to
save this, we're going to run the

45

00:04:31,630  -->  00:04:37,540
controller file, no socket could be created
and that's because I've already got it

46

00:04:37,540  -->  00:04:44,470
running, I guess. So let's close this tab, let's connect, re-run this, we're going to

47

00:04:44,470  -->  00:04:47,650
refresh here, as you can see we're not
logged in because we are presented with

48

00:04:47,650  -->  00:04:49,930
the generic Hello CodeWizard, so

49

00:04:49,930  -->  00:04:59,260
let's go ahead and login. I believe the
user was nick1 and avocado1.

50

00:04:59,260  -->  00:05:04,810
Now once we get logged in you'll notice
that it is personalized and this does

51

00:05:04,810  -->  00:05:07,000
demonstrate the fact that we are logged
in,

52

00:05:07,000  -->  00:05:11,710
in addition that if statement in the
main layout has presented now a logout

53

00:05:11,710  -->  00:05:15,220
link. So we can do whatever we're going
to do here, refresh pages, the session

54

00:05:15,220  -->  00:05:18,250
is going to remain persistent. However,
when we want to log out

55

00:05:18,910  -->  00:05:23,710
we just click that log out link and you
can see now the system is registering

56

00:05:23,710  -->  00:05:27,910
that we are logged out, we get the same
generic CodeWizard here, and we get the

57

00:05:27,910  -->  00:05:28,750
login links.
