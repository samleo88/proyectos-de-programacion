00:00.090 --> 00:01.000
All right all right.

00:01.230 --> 00:04.740
I know you're eager to start working with actual properties and values.

00:04.740 --> 00:11.040
So here it goes even though we have already used color properties pretty much for all our examples why

00:11.040 --> 00:16.980
don't we start with colors and then we're going to go from there and we'll start very simply by looking

00:16.980 --> 00:23.340
at two properties that you'll use most of the time with colors color property responsible for the color

00:23.340 --> 00:27.900
of the text and background color responsible for the color of the background.

00:27.900 --> 00:30.370
First let's practice with some more Ashley and.

00:30.540 --> 00:35.540
So I'm gonna head over to my index agency now and you know what maybe before we do that I'm gonna get

00:35.540 --> 00:41.030
rid of these paragraphs and whatever Asterix I'm not gonna need it right now.

00:41.130 --> 00:47.460
And then within the next session you know I'm just gonna create basically two headings with each of

00:47.460 --> 00:52.350
them having a separate div or I'm sorry not just Div I would separate ideas.

00:52.410 --> 00:57.060
So I'm going to say let's say there's going to be hanging three and within having three we're gonna

00:57.090 --> 01:05.750
write out an I.D. and let's call this first and this is just gonna be I am heading adding number one.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.580
And by the way I notice that all the time a misspelling this.

01:08.970 --> 01:10.440
So if you are annoyed by this.

01:10.440 --> 01:14.100
My apologies but unfortunately that's what happens.

01:14.100 --> 01:17.970
I do like the misspelled stuff so let's right here second.

01:18.150 --> 01:19.750
So I'm gonna have two headings.

01:19.830 --> 01:26.340
One is gonna be number and one let's say and the other one is gonna be number two.

01:26.340 --> 01:28.470
So let's see how this is gonna look like.

01:28.470 --> 01:30.650
Very simply we have two headings.

01:30.810 --> 01:36.950
Now I'm gonna head over back to Celsius as like I said I'm going to start working with the color properties.

01:37.020 --> 01:39.120
Now we're not gonna look at the values right now.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.440
Meaning all can I use the most basic ones.

01:41.460 --> 01:48.330
Those are all gonna cover in next videos but let's just start by looking at the properties that you

01:48.330 --> 01:50.300
will use all the time with your colors.

01:50.310 --> 01:55.490
So first let's start by selecting a div now the div or I'm sorry the I.D..

01:55.560 --> 02:02.850
Some reason I keep naming my I.D. the divs and my first I.D. is going to have color.

02:02.930 --> 02:04.980
Now the color property again could be anything.

02:05.400 --> 02:10.140
We're gonna go with I don't know something like this and this is gonna be my color and then we're looking

02:10.140 --> 02:11.530
for the background color.

02:11.610 --> 02:16.320
Now the background color is I going to be responsible for the background of the moment I'm gonna save

02:16.320 --> 02:16.670
it.

02:16.710 --> 02:23.070
Notice right now my I.D. with a name first is gonna look like this.

02:23.070 --> 02:26.470
So it's gonna have this background and obviously this would be the color.

02:26.750 --> 02:31.830
And again this would work with any element that you would like to apart from obviously something like

02:31.890 --> 02:37.890
image where image is totally separate HDMI element of let's say it would work with the link it would

02:37.890 --> 02:41.400
work with the paragraph now with the links there are some caveats to it.

02:42.400 --> 02:47.410
But generally speaking every time you would want the color of the text to be some kind of color you

02:47.410 --> 02:48.930
would use the code properly.

02:48.940 --> 02:52.960
And every time you would want a background you use the background color property.

02:52.960 --> 02:58.930
Now let's also test that out for the second Heidi because I would like to show you where the background

02:58.930 --> 03:00.780
actually has the shorthand.

03:00.790 --> 03:05.700
So I'm gonna go here and we're going to say that there is gonna be obviously the idea.

03:05.710 --> 03:08.140
Second I believe that's how he named it.

03:08.650 --> 03:11.130
And yeah let's again use some kind of color.

03:11.170 --> 03:14.220
Now this is just gonna be some crimson or something like this.

03:14.440 --> 03:17.720
And then let's work with the background now with the background.

03:17.770 --> 03:24.410
Eventually will and also look at the background images and what happens is that all images we would

03:24.410 --> 03:28.700
use something like this and again we're not going to cover this in a great detail right now because

03:28.700 --> 03:33.950
we're going to look at it later but at the end of the day we can combine both of these properties here

03:34.340 --> 03:35.900
and just write the shorthand.

03:35.900 --> 03:38.910
And this is something that you're going to see a lot in a C assess.

03:39.080 --> 03:43.710
And obviously we're going to cover this a lot because we can do the same thing we had let's say pairings

03:43.730 --> 03:45.820
or margin and you get an idea.

03:45.830 --> 03:50.950
So in our case instead of writing the long way where we're just looking for the color we can just write

03:50.950 --> 03:51.600
background.

03:51.650 --> 03:56.360
And then here we can write either the color or later on we're obviously going to start working with

03:56.360 --> 04:01.630
images as our background so in our case let's just say that this is gonna be yellow and we can save

04:01.630 --> 04:01.850
it.

04:01.870 --> 04:04.370
And notice that it's going to work exactly the same way.

04:04.940 --> 04:10.820
So just please be aware that you can use background color just as you're working on the color but later

04:10.820 --> 04:16.010
on as we're going to start work with the images we're also can use the background shorthand where we

04:16.010 --> 04:19.820
just write background and then whatever value we're typing here for the color.
