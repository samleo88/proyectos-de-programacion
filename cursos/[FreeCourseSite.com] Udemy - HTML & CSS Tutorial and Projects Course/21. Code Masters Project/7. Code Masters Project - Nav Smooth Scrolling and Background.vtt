WEBVTT

00:00.490 --> 00:03.360
And basically the way it works in a nutshell.

00:03.430 --> 00:07.510
Right what's going to happen is that I'm going to set with javascript.

00:07.580 --> 00:10.240
I write a rule for functioning.

00:10.350 --> 00:15.600
So what's going to happen is I'm going to say that once I scroll past some point.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.210
All right I'm going to add over here this class.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.860
I mean this background class right.

00:19.860 --> 00:21.360
So what's going to happen first.

00:21.390 --> 00:27.000
What I would need to do is actually I would need to have a background when someone is going to say we're

00:27.000 --> 00:29.430
here and I'm going to go back to the rules.

00:29.430 --> 00:29.680
Right.

00:29.680 --> 00:30.760
So this was all here.

00:30.780 --> 00:33.090
So this was for the men with.

00:33.150 --> 00:36.500
But now we're going to deal with a actual document.

00:36.500 --> 00:36.780
Right.

00:36.780 --> 00:40.170
So this is not going to be affected by the screen size right.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.350
This is going to be affected in general.

00:42.420 --> 00:43.020
Right.

00:43.020 --> 00:51.110
So for now if I'm going on a background class so I'm going to create this class I have background here

00:51.440 --> 00:56.090
and for that background all I'm going to say is I'm going to be background and the background is going

00:56.090 --> 00:58.090
to be here.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.480
Zero zero zero point five.

01:00.540 --> 01:00.940
Right.

01:00.980 --> 01:05.900
And again the same as would that change class that we added for the button we're not going to be able

01:05.900 --> 01:06.700
to see it right now.

01:06.700 --> 01:07.180
Right.

01:07.190 --> 01:09.570
We're going to be using it in javascript.

01:09.590 --> 01:16.460
Now what I also want to do is you see here in I have this number unsexual it fixed it.

01:16.470 --> 01:18.200
It's all the time stays fixed.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.160
So how do we do it.

01:19.250 --> 01:19.780
Right.

01:20.030 --> 01:22.580
And the reason why we're writing this separately right.

01:22.580 --> 01:27.470
Not all the way to the top of the document because I just want you to see how it actually works right

01:27.710 --> 01:31.250
because it makes a little bit more sense that we are actually adding this rule over here.

01:31.250 --> 01:31.800
Right.

01:31.850 --> 01:35.320
Not in the beginning of document where we couldn't see anything at all.

01:35.330 --> 01:36.000
Right.

01:36.080 --> 01:41.240
And the way it works here we're going to say this is going to be out of position here we're going to

01:41.240 --> 01:44.370
say this is going to be fixed or fixed.

01:44.510 --> 01:51.080
Then once we have the fix we would want a width here and we're going to send with it is going to be

01:51.080 --> 01:53.900
actually 100 percent or less.

01:54.050 --> 01:58.330
Once we have with 100 percent we'll have a z index.

01:58.370 --> 01:59.790
This is going to be 10.

01:59.790 --> 02:05.430
All right so this makes sure that our nav bar is always on top of the other elements.

02:05.630 --> 02:10.010
And over here we're going to say in transition and we're going to say transition is going to be for

02:10.010 --> 02:10.550
the background.

02:10.580 --> 02:11.170
Right.

02:11.180 --> 02:16.550
So basically what I'm saying is that once they have this Navara glass right this should happen over

02:16.550 --> 02:16.910
time.

02:16.910 --> 02:22.270
Some of them say background again two seconds and he's going this right.

02:22.460 --> 02:25.560
And this background is obviously going to be added with the Javascript.

02:26.000 --> 02:34.350
And last thing maybe on here while we're still see SS or want to change this with the screen size changes

02:34.380 --> 02:34.920
right.

02:35.090 --> 02:38.470
So we can do it separately or we can add it over here one more roll.

02:38.510 --> 02:39.180
Right.

02:39.230 --> 02:41.180
And that's really up to you.

02:41.240 --> 02:46.860
I'm just going to go back over here right within this media right within this 992.

02:47.030 --> 02:53.720
I'm going to say for the man or a card here I'm going to say class of banner card or here I'm going

02:53.720 --> 02:59.320
to say that this is going to be flex and 0 0 and this is going to be 70 percent.

02:59.530 --> 03:04.450
So basically what I'm saying is once the screen gets bigger I don't want it to be 90 percent.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.650
I want it to be 70 percent right.

03:06.710 --> 03:08.230
So I'll say this right.

03:08.430 --> 03:14.990
And now what we would need to do is actually go ahead and work or here in the jobs and because we're

03:14.990 --> 03:18.520
done with main CSSA four hour nap.

03:18.570 --> 03:19.130
All right.

03:19.210 --> 03:23.630
And the way we work is all here we're going to say script and let's say on here and this is going to

03:23.630 --> 03:28.340
be a comment that I'm going to say toggle button here.

03:28.400 --> 03:35.900
Now once we have the toggle button we're now going to have a transparent background so transparent background

03:36.360 --> 03:36.850
here.

03:37.070 --> 03:38.200
And how do we do that.

03:38.360 --> 03:42.950
So here we're going to use a query and we're going to select a window right.

03:43.040 --> 03:46.400
So I'm going to say window and then we're going to have a scroll.

03:46.610 --> 03:50.210
And so this is going to be another function the same how we have a ready function that we have clicked

03:50.210 --> 03:51.080
function.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.640
So this function works only when we are scrolling.

03:53.720 --> 03:54.140
Right.

03:54.200 --> 04:00.800
So I'm going to say function and open and close parentheses and all here and this is going to be a curly

04:00.800 --> 04:02.020
braces right.

04:02.150 --> 04:08.120
And then over here I'm going to create a variable and I'm going to say Position Position more here and

04:08.120 --> 04:09.660
this position is going to be equal.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.060
Right.

04:10.070 --> 04:18.800
So this variable is going to be equal to or here a dollar sign window window and this is going to be

04:18.800 --> 04:20.250
scrolled up.

04:20.650 --> 04:24.650
And basically what scroll of means is that this is going to give the value.

04:24.700 --> 04:24.980
Right.

04:25.070 --> 04:31.770
So this variable is going to be equal to the position of the window right here like this.

04:31.970 --> 04:37.070
And then what we're going to say is as we're scrolling right the position is obviously going to change

04:37.070 --> 04:38.920
right as we're scrolling down right.

04:38.930 --> 04:42.040
The actual number is going to keep on increasing.

04:42.050 --> 04:48.020
Now what we're saying here is that if we're here position which is the variable which is the actual

04:48.020 --> 04:53.800
scrolling position of the window is bigger or equal more here to the hundred.

04:54.110 --> 04:55.300
We're like this right.

04:55.430 --> 04:56.730
Something should happen.

04:56.780 --> 04:57.490
All right.

04:57.530 --> 05:02.570
And that something is going to be first that we're going to have a number of containers is going to

05:02.570 --> 05:03.800
have this background glass.

05:03.800 --> 05:04.300
All right.

05:04.410 --> 05:11.020
So here I'm going to say that this is going to be something that if it's if something were we're am

05:11.020 --> 05:16.190
going to say dollar sign and or here I'm going to select two things I'm going to say now I'm going to

05:16.190 --> 05:18.640
say now container or here like this.

05:18.650 --> 05:19.010
Right.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.330
So both of them.

05:20.570 --> 05:24.250
This guy over here on a smaller screen and now on a bigger.

05:24.260 --> 05:24.570
All right.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.300
But I want to affect them both.

05:26.440 --> 05:33.230
And I'm all here going to say add class and class and what will be the class and the class is going

05:33.230 --> 05:34.280
to be now background.

05:34.280 --> 05:38.540
So we're going to have background so that's going to be that transparent class.

05:38.540 --> 05:39.430
All right.

05:39.500 --> 05:43.130
And over here basically I'm saying if the position is more than a.

05:43.130 --> 05:43.590
Right.

05:43.640 --> 05:48.560
So if I scroll more than 100 However if I'm going to be less than 100 I'm just going to remove that

05:48.560 --> 05:49.230
class.

05:49.230 --> 05:49.650
All right.

05:49.790 --> 05:56.090
So what I can do over here is I'm going to say else here I'm just going to copy this right and I'm going

05:56.090 --> 06:00.820
to say remove the glass so I can just cut this or you know what I don't want to cut it.

06:00.830 --> 06:06.950
I want to leave it on a copy this and copy and paste it here instead of adding class we're going to

06:06.950 --> 06:10.980
say remove remove glass like this.

06:11.010 --> 06:13.250
Right now we may need to do.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.920
So we do have two classes like this.

06:16.130 --> 06:20.590
We say right now we have positions more than 100 right now.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.610
Now container and class else.

06:22.610 --> 06:26.250
Now there are of course right here very simple.

06:26.260 --> 06:26.760
All right.

06:26.840 --> 06:31.210
And this is still going to be you know scroll position right now.

06:31.220 --> 06:33.440
We're not going to be able to see it right now.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.040
All right.

06:34.100 --> 06:38.490
Because again for our document we're not really we have hundred viewers right now.

06:38.500 --> 06:38.720
Right.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.120
So it's not going to be squalling.

06:40.170 --> 06:42.590
However you can see obviously how it works here right.

06:42.590 --> 06:43.490
I have hundreds.

06:43.550 --> 06:46.180
And you can see that now I have this background here right.

06:46.340 --> 06:46.940
I go up.

06:46.970 --> 06:47.900
I don't have it.

06:48.170 --> 06:50.500
I go to the smaller screen the same thing right.

06:50.510 --> 06:55.020
I go over here the background changes right and stays like this.

06:55.040 --> 07:01.540
Now what I would want to do is also want to have this small scrolling rents or here you can see that

07:01.610 --> 07:02.840
as I press them.

07:02.970 --> 07:03.200
Right.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.100
I'm going to have a smooth scrolling or I like this right.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.920
So it's cruel scrolls all the way to the position.

07:08.920 --> 07:09.590
All right.

07:09.640 --> 07:14.810
And if I want to go back or here right and it doesn't happen right away it actually takes a little bit

07:14.810 --> 07:15.680
of time.

07:15.680 --> 07:16.980
So how do I do this.

07:16.990 --> 07:21.280
I mean so this was transparent background and I had another comment.

07:21.440 --> 07:29.200
And here we're going to the right smooth scroll scroll over here and how this moves scrolling should

07:29.210 --> 07:29.810
happen.

07:30.070 --> 07:35.380
So here we're going to say that we wouldn't want to select one here like this and we're going to say

07:35.430 --> 07:42.160
parentheses and numbers are not parentheses grab quotation marks nav links.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.190
All right.

07:43.390 --> 07:48.730
And the reason for this I don't want to select here the font awesome icons right because there were

07:48.730 --> 07:49.380
also links.

07:49.390 --> 07:55.050
I just want to select the mantling say an or hearing a click function again.

07:55.150 --> 07:59.700
Similar to what we had are here and we're going to write on your function.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.360
Open and close parentheses.

08:01.420 --> 08:03.340
Curly braces are here.

08:03.340 --> 08:10.750
And first what we would want to do is we're here in this function we just need to write a parameter

08:10.840 --> 08:14.740
and then we can write that this is going to be the link and you can write any name you want.

08:14.780 --> 08:15.310
Right.

08:15.340 --> 08:18.970
This is basically what saying is I'm going to select all the links right.

08:19.030 --> 08:21.930
And as I'm going each link something should happen right.

08:22.150 --> 08:28.180
So here I'm going to say link and I'm going to say prevent default and default So basically they're

08:28.180 --> 08:31.760
not going to let's say hash tag or something like that.

08:31.760 --> 08:32.260
Right.

08:32.320 --> 08:37.360
So I'm going to have a proven default and then we get to we're going to create a variable and I'm going

08:37.360 --> 08:43.030
to say target and we're going to said select this variable and we're going to say that this is going

08:43.030 --> 08:46.230
to equal two dollar sign here.

08:46.380 --> 08:49.990
This is an attribute.

08:49.990 --> 08:53.340
And we're going to say that this is going to be Tref attribute.

08:53.380 --> 08:57.970
So basically what I'm saying is because we're getting back a list of other things.

08:58.150 --> 09:04.570
So each of them as I'm passing through right now would want to get to HGF attribute and we know that

09:04.630 --> 09:07.450
Atra attribute basically is the value.

09:07.610 --> 09:11.270
I mean remember this guy out here we have the values right.

09:11.320 --> 09:14.770
Remember if the banner value or the skills value.

09:14.780 --> 09:15.390
Right.

09:15.470 --> 09:20.200
So we're going to go back to script and what we're going to say over here and again and we will want

09:20.200 --> 09:29.700
to select a HMO and body had both of them and we would want to had a annulment.

09:29.950 --> 09:31.990
Now before we have an inmate.

09:32.010 --> 09:32.330
Right.

09:32.350 --> 09:39.940
I just want to have a stop because you're not adding stop what's going to happen is after a while and

09:39.970 --> 09:46.930
you keep pressing it you'll notice that you're actually your browser gets stuck right.

09:46.930 --> 09:53.110
And it's not doing anymore right because it will have a lot of animations that are actually in the queue

09:53.110 --> 09:53.950
before.

09:53.960 --> 09:54.390
All right.

09:54.490 --> 09:57.040
So what you need to write here disfunctions stop.

09:57.090 --> 09:57.500
Right.

09:57.580 --> 10:01.120
And then we're going to write it now in order to test this.

10:01.120 --> 10:01.390
Right.

10:01.390 --> 10:05.700
You can write on here without the stop and you can test it out how it works.

10:05.710 --> 10:11.770
And you'll notice that after you click a few times actually your animation is going to stop because

10:11.890 --> 10:15.670
the browser is going to be scheduling way too many of these animations.

10:15.670 --> 10:16.130
Right.

10:16.360 --> 10:20.820
So we're going to have all had to stop and then will have animate and inanimate.

10:20.820 --> 10:26.140
Since this is an object we're going to find that this is going to be a property and the property we're

10:26.140 --> 10:28.860
interested in Scroll up scroll.

10:28.920 --> 10:34.720
We're going to set up right and here the value of this property is going to be here.

10:34.780 --> 10:37.650
We're going to get this variable right.

10:37.740 --> 10:41.110
And we're going to set it equal to right an Oreo going right.

10:41.110 --> 10:47.600
Target right equal to our variable offset set here.

10:48.550 --> 10:53.720
Like this offset function and then it will set up like this.

10:53.730 --> 10:54.230
Right.

10:54.260 --> 11:01.430
So basically what I'm saying is get me the link get me the attribute of the link and then use this attribute

11:01.430 --> 11:04.880
to set my whole body to that position.

11:04.900 --> 11:05.500
All right.

11:05.960 --> 11:12.200
So what I'm going to say on here top now what I also can do is all here place a comma and then I'm going

11:12.200 --> 11:13.040
to say 50000.

11:13.050 --> 11:13.550
Right.

11:13.640 --> 11:20.480
So basically again 3000 milliseconds which is three seconds and you can put a or hear a semicolon right

11:21.050 --> 11:27.940
and you'll see these things once we have a second here a section which is going to be our skills.

11:27.940 --> 11:30.860
However the final is going to look like this right.

11:30.860 --> 11:33.830
So again we're going to have a home which is going to be the banner.

11:33.950 --> 11:34.970
No here now.

11:35.120 --> 11:41.120
You can see that we're smooth scrolling skills then we smooth scrolling to about section and it's going

11:41.120 --> 11:46.420
to be the project section and then we'll have a team section and all here.

11:46.550 --> 11:50.540
We didn't have the last one or last to write but we added these two.

11:50.540 --> 11:52.130
So this is how it's going to work.

11:52.340 --> 11:55.990
And also you can see that only as I scroll past 100.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.420
All right I'm going to have this Bangham I scroll back.

11:58.460 --> 11:59.870
I don't have the background.

11:59.870 --> 12:03.740
The same thing works or here I scroll past hundred of the background.

12:03.770 --> 12:04.860
Scroll down.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.350
I don't have the background.

12:07.380 --> 12:11.690
Now I'm recording this just to show you that everything works right.

12:11.800 --> 12:17.100
And because I already had a door here the skills section and now the issue is that actually it doesn't

12:17.100 --> 12:17.560
work right.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.520
Because I actually made a mistake right.

12:19.530 --> 12:22.970
So you can see or hear we don't have the background over here right.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.120
And as I'm clicking nothing is happening.

12:25.320 --> 12:31.200
And the reason for that over here you can see that with the small scroll I missed over here this dot.

12:31.430 --> 12:34.840
So once we ended up now this is the function actually right.

12:34.860 --> 12:39.190
So if we save this and if we refresh Now you can see we're here now.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.100
I have this dark background.

12:41.430 --> 12:46.110
And once I click it or here now it's going to be only the skills section obviously.

12:46.290 --> 12:50.560
We haven't added the other sections or we can go back on more here right.

12:50.610 --> 12:52.900
But this is going to be the background is working right now.

12:52.920 --> 12:53.490
Right.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.260
And also the small scroll.
