WEBVTT

00:00.670 --> 00:05.850
And the first thing that we need to do is we need to do our set up so here you can see that I'm sitting

00:05.850 --> 00:11.340
in my desktop and I'm going to just create a folder all here and I'm going to say this is going to be

00:11.340 --> 00:14.680
Agency and I'm using the brackets texter.

00:14.820 --> 00:17.870
So the only thing that I'm going to do is I'm just going to drag on here as well.

00:17.880 --> 00:18.580
Right.

00:18.610 --> 00:23.840
Right away I'm going to create a new file and I'm going to say this is going to be index page.

00:24.130 --> 00:24.660
Right.

00:24.850 --> 00:30.870
Once I have the engine now here I'm just going to create a live preview so we can see it better.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.280
And I'm just going to put them side by side right.

00:33.350 --> 00:39.900
So now I have a live preview and I have my index HDMI right there and another new file right away can

00:39.900 --> 00:41.220
create is going to be made.

00:41.340 --> 00:44.680
That's probably going to be doing all styling right.

00:44.760 --> 00:48.640
And obviously you're here we need a ha mascot right.

00:48.660 --> 00:50.640
So I'm just going to be using brackets extensions.

00:50.640 --> 00:54.270
But you can actually write it or get it yourself or something like that.

00:54.270 --> 00:54.810
Right.

00:54.840 --> 00:59.420
So I'm just going to go with the basic one right with a basic metal tags.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.400
Or you could just put it in language is going to be English.

01:02.400 --> 01:02.980
Right.

01:03.090 --> 01:07.440
But really just going to say this is going to be title web agency.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.030
Right.

01:08.080 --> 01:13.380
And you can see that I messed up that I'm actually creating this in mainsheet SS So I apologize for

01:13.380 --> 01:15.930
that and was purely on me.

01:15.990 --> 01:16.310
Right.

01:16.310 --> 01:21.570
So I can just cut this one out and go back to the next page where we shouldn't be creating this.

01:21.570 --> 01:27.510
Right now we have the index page to himself and with the title of web agency right.

01:27.660 --> 01:30.940
And then we write a need in our head tag right.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.130
We need a few things right.

01:32.130 --> 01:36.800
First it's going to be a Google fonts of.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.610
Then we're going to have a font awesome right.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.430
This is what we are also going to need.

01:41.540 --> 01:46.610
Font are some more here and then it's going to be our mainsheet assess.

01:46.680 --> 01:50.760
So again our comment I'm going to say main CSSA right.

01:50.770 --> 01:56.070
I going to just start with this one which is going to create a link to Mencius us right now that we're

01:56.070 --> 01:57.040
connected.

01:57.120 --> 02:03.230
We can actually go head into Google tactual web browser and get our Google fonts right.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.550
So we're going to go back on here.

02:05.580 --> 02:09.640
It's going to maximize this one and you can see the first thing that Google finds right.

02:09.660 --> 02:15.010
So we obviously can google it or I mean just type right when Google fonts and we go here.

02:15.180 --> 02:17.010
And for those of you who don't know.

02:17.070 --> 02:17.340
Right.

02:17.340 --> 02:22.770
So this is you can pick all of the phones whatever you like and or here you can see that you can have

02:22.830 --> 02:24.780
a different preferences right.

02:24.810 --> 02:30.630
You have more specific right you can have a bigger thickness font or something like that.

02:30.630 --> 02:31.190
Right.

02:31.200 --> 02:36.400
So over here I'm just going to be using right away rebottle because that's my favorite one.

02:36.450 --> 02:38.680
So here are just a plus.

02:38.820 --> 02:40.390
And then I see what I would need to do.

02:40.380 --> 02:40.900
Right.

02:41.130 --> 02:46.440
Or hear what they say is get this link here like this and then obviously this is what we would need

02:46.530 --> 02:48.130
a font family right.

02:48.170 --> 02:50.130
So we're going to go back to our document.

02:50.460 --> 02:55.620
And I'm just going to paste this and if we say this in this age I'll know here.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.820
I'm just going to say for the body we're going to create it.

02:57.830 --> 02:58.940
All right.

02:59.090 --> 03:02.140
And copy capitis font family right.

03:02.190 --> 03:03.770
Are you doing this.

03:03.940 --> 03:05.300
To say copy.

03:05.610 --> 03:11.870
Post it here and once we're done with this and once we're done with Google phones the next one wouldn't

03:11.880 --> 03:12.960
be fun to us.

03:13.010 --> 03:18.200
It can cause this guy over here and over here you can see right away that they're offering us to download.

03:18.200 --> 03:18.710
Right.

03:18.790 --> 03:20.420
And we're actually going to do that right.

03:20.490 --> 03:24.430
Just get it out of the way and they are offering you some extra things.

03:24.610 --> 03:26.720
But Buddhisms say we don't want that.

03:26.820 --> 03:32.540
You know things just don't want to have some on here and you can see that for getting started right.

03:32.730 --> 03:33.820
And icons.

03:33.930 --> 03:37.510
So obviously we're going to be checking out the icons once we're working.

03:37.540 --> 03:37.900
Right.

03:38.040 --> 03:44.430
But if you want on your own you can go and see or hear where the My Cancer is going to look and getting

03:44.430 --> 03:44.820
started.

03:44.830 --> 03:46.260
What we would need to do right.

03:46.470 --> 03:48.420
So if we're downloading right.

03:48.490 --> 03:50.720
We think they're asking for here is the path.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.240
And over here they're saying if we're using SAS or less right now we're going to be downloading So what

03:58.260 --> 04:01.200
do we need to show is the actual path to form.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.230
Mincey.

04:02.390 --> 04:02.960
Right.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.980
So if we go back and I'm just going to go to my downloads and this is going to be my phantasm my soul

04:09.040 --> 04:10.740
is going to open why we're here.

04:10.950 --> 04:15.050
And that I just need to get this folder all the way over here.

04:15.220 --> 04:17.040
So I'm going to get it over here.

04:17.250 --> 04:24.010
And once it's over here then I can go back to my document or here in the page.

04:24.270 --> 04:28.280
And for the phantasm I'm just saying this is going to be a link.

04:28.440 --> 04:28.920
Right.

04:28.980 --> 04:33.140
And once I'll have a link I'm just going to say this is going to be fun and then I'm going to see assess

04:33.510 --> 04:34.520
and then I want a.

04:34.550 --> 04:35.320
Awesome.

04:35.350 --> 04:36.370
SS Right.

04:36.370 --> 04:42.460
And just to test it out and go ahead and let's create a phantasm Mike and I'm going to say for all.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.790
Let's make it like five times bigger.

04:44.840 --> 04:45.190
Right.

04:45.360 --> 04:49.210
So press tab and you can see that now we have our phone on right.

04:49.260 --> 04:50.540
So everything is working.

04:50.850 --> 04:56.250
So we can just delete this guy right now or here and if we go back and see what else we need to do.

04:56.250 --> 04:57.060
Right.

04:57.060 --> 05:03.130
So we're here I'm just going to get this right and or here you can see that of course right.

05:03.130 --> 05:11.800
So if you're struggling with coddlers like I am why this is a very good site this loss that CEO on here

05:11.890 --> 05:16.560
and what we can do is just press over here and we can start generating the colors right.

05:16.570 --> 05:19.170
So you can see that it's going to maybe take a little bit right.

05:19.270 --> 05:25.170
But once we press spacebar print or we can see that we have the options right for the college.

05:25.300 --> 05:30.640
And I really strongly suggest this for anybody who is really struggling to pick colors right because

05:30.640 --> 05:36.270
this is a really good option and obviously just write down the colors what you want get them to your

05:36.280 --> 05:38.310
document and you can start working right.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.920
And this is a really nice choice here.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.680
If you want you can like this color and you can see the rest of them are changing.

05:44.680 --> 05:49.010
So this is a very very good place to find your colors.

05:49.090 --> 05:55.660
Now after not one we would want is a images right now in the beginning of the next video you're obviously

05:55.660 --> 05:58.120
going to see what kind of images I have.

05:58.120 --> 06:02.640
But there's three sides that I couldn't suggest more which is pixels.

06:02.700 --> 06:08.070
Right then we have a splash and over here we have gladdest right.

06:08.230 --> 06:10.130
So again all of them are good.

06:10.150 --> 06:13.720
All of them high high quality Hunger-Free images right.

06:13.720 --> 06:17.200
So just go ahead download whatever you like for your project.

06:17.350 --> 06:17.740
Right.

06:17.890 --> 06:22.660
And let's start cracking and next video I'm going to show you the specific set of the.
