00:00.240 --> 00:01.040
Excellent.

00:01.050 --> 00:04.190
Our next topic is semantic age the AMA.

00:04.670 --> 00:05.070
OK.

00:05.140 --> 00:06.660
What does that mean.

00:06.660 --> 00:12.800
Well in general that means that you use specific elements to structure your content instead of Dave.

00:12.830 --> 00:19.860
This Dave dad's band this band that usually email semantic tags are no different than regular tags.

00:19.980 --> 00:22.240
Their syntax remains the same.

00:22.320 --> 00:28.770
We can still add classes we can still add ideas to them and we can style them from the CSA as using

00:28.770 --> 00:29.900
the elements selectors.

00:30.360 --> 00:38.400
However they do provide us with a structure and their content gives a browser idea of what to do and

00:38.400 --> 00:39.240
how to do it.

00:39.630 --> 00:46.770
Using semantic tags also improves your site's accessibility for let's say a screen readers and keyboard

00:46.770 --> 00:48.030
navigation.

00:48.030 --> 00:53.730
I would suggest though not to get too worked up about it because you have more important things to worry

00:53.730 --> 00:54.470
about.

00:54.570 --> 00:57.150
And since using them will seem natural.

00:57.150 --> 00:58.900
The more projects you are gonna build anyway.

00:59.490 --> 01:03.890
Okay so how do we can start working with HCM all semantic tags.

01:03.960 --> 01:07.610
First of all I guess we're going to get rid of everything that we have to.

01:07.950 --> 01:14.860
Then we're also gonna head over to in their session email and kind of give you an idea how before age

01:14.860 --> 01:20.030
the AML semantic tags came along we were writing the email and CFS.

01:20.170 --> 01:23.450
Let's say we had some kind of NAV so we wrote here Dave.

01:23.620 --> 01:26.200
Then they have a class of NAV.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.960
So within the NAV we placed everything that we had in.

01:29.530 --> 01:33.150
Now again I'm just going to use three dots to give you an idea.

01:33.370 --> 01:39.280
Then let's say you had some kind of a header and you had a div and class and then here were writing

01:39.280 --> 01:41.560
the banner and so on so forth.

01:41.590 --> 01:47.800
So again we can write Dave class and let's say this is gonna be four and hopefully you understand the

01:47.790 --> 01:48.340
idea.

01:48.820 --> 01:54.880
While this is technically Okay first of all it doesn't structure anything in your content you're just

01:54.880 --> 01:59.360
looking at 10000 deaths and that doesn't really make sense as well.

01:59.370 --> 02:03.920
It doesn't tell you the browsers anything what is happening within your content.

02:04.030 --> 02:09.940
And like I said also the accessibility is an issue because screen readers are not going to differentiate

02:09.940 --> 02:12.790
between them now what would be the solution.

02:12.800 --> 02:19.480
First of all let me say the styles here and we will gonna be looking at very general examples because

02:19.480 --> 02:24.520
like I said as we're working with the projects we all gonna be using those elements and it's not like

02:24.550 --> 02:29.040
just because we're at the element our site is gonna break or anything like that.

02:29.170 --> 02:35.200
Like I said also before I wouldn't really worry about it too much anyway right now because the more

02:35.200 --> 02:39.610
projects you're going to build the more semantic tags you're going to use the more you're going to remember

02:39.610 --> 02:43.510
them understand them and life is gonna be easier for you.

02:43.510 --> 02:47.740
Okay so we're all going to be looking we can just say Monty.

02:48.100 --> 02:54.940
It's not semantics semantic age the amount we can maybe try this one and they pretty much spit you back

02:55.030 --> 02:57.460
everything that there is about semantic.

02:57.490 --> 03:03.070
First maybe we can look at the images and the general idea would be like this where for the header and

03:03.160 --> 03:08.410
let's say we're going to be use the header element and we're gonna want an element then section section

03:08.410 --> 03:10.370
is gonna represent some kind of code.

03:10.510 --> 03:15.660
Then let's say a side and the footer and what's happening again we can add ideas to this.

03:15.670 --> 03:17.870
We can have the classes for this.

03:17.950 --> 03:23.900
We can place the content here and just because you add this h the email tag your h the email or CSA

03:24.030 --> 03:25.210
is not going to break.

03:25.340 --> 03:28.520
It's just gonna give you a structure where you're looking at your like Okay.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.000
So this is gonna be my header where I'm going to have the header.

03:31.030 --> 03:31.350
Okay.

03:31.360 --> 03:35.410
So this is gonna be my now and the same way the browser is gonna work.

03:35.710 --> 03:39.740
And the screen readers will understand what is happening now.

03:39.760 --> 03:45.340
Like I said we will gonna be covering this way more in the project because we're just gonna use them.

03:45.370 --> 03:49.940
So that's the best way how to actually cover this is just to use those elements.

03:49.960 --> 03:55.960
Now if you do want to research more again you can go to W3 three schools where they again explain everything

03:55.960 --> 03:58.360
what is happening and why would you use them.

03:58.360 --> 04:03.850
I will gonna do my explanations as we're working with the project because this is just makes more sense

04:04.270 --> 04:08.250
and in general the idea what we are simple will just go with some kind of header.

04:08.260 --> 04:13.000
Then there's going to be footer and then everything else I'm going to be structuring within the sections

04:13.480 --> 04:17.710
and then within the section let's say if I would want something separate we'll just gonna.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.270
I don't know setup the article or something like this.

04:20.380 --> 04:27.250
We can place the NAV within the header we can use the header within the section there is you know you

04:27.250 --> 04:28.710
can have multiple options.

04:28.750 --> 04:35.380
It's not has a rigid as you think right now just because you learned about them doesn't mean that it's

04:35.380 --> 04:37.300
exactly how you need to use them.

04:37.300 --> 04:42.450
Yeah there's some general ideas behind them you probably wouldn't want to put the footer whereas the

04:42.450 --> 04:42.900
header.

04:43.350 --> 04:48.260
But again if I would be you I really wouldn't lose too much sleep about it.
