00:00.060 --> 00:06.210
Next one up we're going to have a customer reviews and on you can see that we're going to be a little

00:06.210 --> 00:14.420
bit lazy because I'm going to be using the same images for a team that I was using or here for a customer.

00:14.430 --> 00:15.000
Right.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.970
So we're going to be using the same for the customers ask for it.

00:19.230 --> 00:21.600
So let's go to the Exchange now.

00:21.860 --> 00:26.950
And as always we're going to have here a customer right the start.

00:27.180 --> 00:29.350
And this is going to be a customer.

00:29.520 --> 00:33.880
So we're writing or here that this is going to be customers right.

00:34.050 --> 00:38.330
So customer list them to select the line.

00:38.400 --> 00:45.450
Then copy this and we're going to say and of custom that after that once we have this right we would

00:45.450 --> 00:50.330
want to first of all section with a hash tag over here.

00:50.540 --> 00:54.260
Customers customers here.

00:54.370 --> 00:58.570
Then we press tab then we're here would want to place a tie.

00:59.020 --> 01:02.170
So again we just need to find the nearest one.

01:02.520 --> 01:09.990
And out here this is going to be this guy who's going to grab this title swing down here and he's going

01:09.990 --> 01:11.040
to say this is going to be.

01:11.130 --> 01:12.180
I know.

01:12.210 --> 01:14.090
Then after that what we would want.

01:14.090 --> 01:16.730
We would want a customer center.

01:16.890 --> 01:19.620
I mean it's all going to say or your customers.

01:20.030 --> 01:24.240
And we're going to say Santer first time and once now we have the.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.480
Now we need to actually create three customers.

01:27.480 --> 01:34.590
So again we're going to start over here and this is going to be article article with a class of customer

01:36.200 --> 01:37.410
press tab.

01:37.410 --> 01:43.320
Now we have the article we're going to have image and again source code here and we're going to say

01:43.320 --> 01:45.240
this is going to be Meijers.

01:45.540 --> 01:52.080
We're going to say team we're going to go with team number one here then we're going to have a heading

01:52.080 --> 02:00.660
three we're hearing this and we're going to say John Doe here that we're going to say that he is a web

02:00.660 --> 02:10.000
developer and so having five a web developer here and then we're going to have one paragraph.

02:10.290 --> 02:20.210
So I'm going to go my over here and have a paragraph to say Warum and I'd say 50 Warham 15 first time

02:20.430 --> 02:22.250
and now we have all here.

02:22.680 --> 02:25.740
So what we will want to do is obviously have three of them right.

02:25.740 --> 02:30.230
So what does the article 1 do here.

02:30.270 --> 02:33.380
What's changed over here and this is going to be Team 2.

02:33.780 --> 02:39.850
And this is going to be Team 3 now that we're done with this we can actually save this and go to see

02:39.880 --> 02:41.370
assess and starts dialing.
