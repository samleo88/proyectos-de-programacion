00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,840
Hey guys, welcome back. So in styling our

2

00:00:03,840  -->  00:00:06,420
application here I've actually extended

3

00:00:06,420  -->  00:00:08,189
the functionality a little bit and I'm going

4

00:00:08,189  -->  00:00:09,780
to explain what I've done and give you

5

00:00:09,780  -->  00:00:11,759
guys some examples. So here's what I've

6

00:00:11,759  -->  00:00:13,950
got so far. I'm gonna be running a gaming

7

00:00:13,950  -->  00:00:16,770
blog, I guess, I'm not going to be going

8

00:00:16,770  -->  00:00:19,050
over the style so much as the changes I've

9

00:00:19,050  -->  00:00:21,720
made to the actual structure of the

10

00:00:21,720  -->  00:00:32,309
application. So, what we've got to do

11

00:00:32,309  -->  00:00:36,570
is as you notice my posts here changed a

12

00:00:36,570  -->  00:00:37,590
bit,

13

00:00:37,590  -->  00:00:41,370
regardless of the style we're more

14

00:00:41,370  -->  00:00:43,980
talking about the fact that you can

15

00:00:43,980  -->  00:00:46,530
upload images now. So if you go to the

16

00:00:46,530  -->  00:00:51,059
back end here you can load up a post and you

17

00:00:51,059  -->  00:00:54,239
can choose a file, you can upload that

18

00:00:54,239  -->  00:00:56,340
file, that one are used I think let's use

19

00:00:56,340  -->  00:00:59,850
that one, and then save it, and then if

20

00:00:59,850  -->  00:01:02,010
you go back to the web page and refresh

21

00:01:02,010  -->  00:01:03,960
you'll see that that has an image now.

22

00:01:03,960  -->  00:01:06,810
And so the way that I have done that,

23

00:01:06,810  -->  00:01:10,290
let's jump into our PyCharm project here

24

00:01:10,290  -->  00:01:16,350
and go into first our settings. So in

25

00:01:16,350  -->  00:01:19,229
settings the same way that we set the

26

00:01:19,229  -->  00:01:22,470
static URL here you also need to make

27

00:01:22,470  -->  00:01:26,670
sure to set media URL equal to the same

28

00:01:26,670  -->  00:01:30,329
format just /media/, and then create

29

00:01:30,329  -->  00:01:37,680
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,

30

00:01:37,680  -->  00:01:40,979
'media/') type it out just

31

00:01:40,979  -->  00:01:44,220
like that. That's going to allow you to

32

00:01:44,220  -->  00:01:47,520
use media files in the creation of posts.

33

00:01:47,520  -->  00:01:52,049
So, what you're going to do is open up

34

00:01:52,049  -->  00:01:54,540
the models here, and you'll see that I

35

00:01:54,540  -->  00:01:58,560
added an image property here to each

36

00:01:58,560  -->  00:02:01,500
post and it's equal to models.ImageField,

37

00:02:01,500  -->  00:02:04,110
which is camel case, and the

38

00:02:04,110  -->  00:02:07,799
default upload location is image. So,

39

00:02:07,799  -->  00:02:10,229
basically when you upload an image it's

40

00:02:10,229  -->  00:02:13,410
going to go into media/image and then

41

00:02:13,410  -->  00:02:13,880
it's

42

00:02:13,880  -->  00:02:16,100
gonna post it there, and it's going to

43

00:02:16,100  -->  00:02:18,380
build an image object inside of the

44

00:02:18,380  -->  00:02:20,600
database for that column. Now when you do

45

00:02:20,600  -->  00:02:22,070
this and you try to run the application

46

00:02:22,070  -->  00:02:25,070
you're going to get problems because some of

47

00:02:25,070  -->  00:02:27,890
the fields don't already have the image

48

00:02:27,890  -->  00:02:30,080
column, and so this is different from

49

00:02:30,080  -->  00:02:32,840
PyMongo. With mongodb you don't have

50

00:02:32,840  -->  00:02:35,390
to worry about that right, but in every

51

00:02:35,390  -->  00:02:39,560
other SQL database, this is SQLite

52

00:02:39,560  -->  00:02:41,450
here, has to lite

53

00:02:41,450  -->  00:02:43,430
whatever it's called there,

54

00:02:43,430  -->  00:02:45,470
not sure how they pronounce it.

55

00:02:45,470  -->  00:02:50,240
So what you're going to do is, what

56

00:02:50,240  -->  00:02:54,950
you need to do first, before you do

57

00:02:54,950  -->  00:02:59,390
anything is you need to make migrations

58

00:02:59,390  -->  00:03:03,740
for the blog before you do anything you

59

00:03:03,740  -->  00:03:07,790
migrate and fake the blog. Then you're going

60

00:03:07,790  -->  00:03:09,710
to go in here and you're going to add

61

00:03:09,710  -->  00:03:11,810
this, you're going to rerun the make

62

00:03:11,810  -->  00:03:14,960
migrations on your blog app, and then

63

00:03:14,960  -->  00:03:17,390
you're going to actually migrate it. So,

64

00:03:17,390  -->  00:03:20,480
this is going to give all other columns,

65

00:03:20,480  -->  00:03:23,180
basically when you,

66

00:03:23,180  -->  00:03:33,640
one sec I ran it up here.

67

00:03:33,640  -->  00:03:36,460
Alright, so when you run the make

68

00:03:36,460  -->  00:03:39,400
migrations the second time

69

00:03:39,400  -->  00:03:42,640
what's going to happen is it is going to

70

00:03:42,640  -->  00:03:43,900
recognize that you're trying to add a

71

00:03:43,900  -->  00:03:46,840
field, so it's gonna allow you to select

72

00:03:46,840  -->  00:03:48,580
a fix and we're going to provide a

73

00:03:48,580  -->  00:03:54,310
default value for all previous posts and

74

00:03:54,310  -->  00:03:57,130
also all posts the future that don't

75

00:03:57,130  -->  00:03:59,440
have an image uploaded to it, and so

76

00:03:59,440  -->  00:04:01,150
you're going to hit the one on your

77

00:04:01,150  -->  00:04:03,069
keyboard and you're just going to type

78

00:04:03,069  -->  00:04:07,330
the name of the placeholder,

79

00:04:07,330  -->  00:04:09,459
essentially. So this is going to be

80

00:04:09,459  -->  00:04:10,150
located in

81

00:04:10,150  -->  00:04:13,510
placeholder.png in the media

82

00:04:13,510  -->  00:04:16,299
directory right above image there. So if

83

00:04:16,299  -->  00:04:21,220
I were to jump over here and take this

84

00:04:21,220  -->  00:04:23,980
image right here, I'm going to copy it

85

00:04:23,980  -->  00:04:32,140
over to PyCharm projects, my site, media,

86

00:04:32,140  -->  00:04:34,990
and paste it right here. I'm going to

87

00:04:34,990  -->  00:04:40,780
rename it to placeholder and this isn't going

88

00:04:40,780  -->  00:04:44,740
to work because that's a JPEG image. So let's

89

00:04:44,740  -->  00:04:51,610
go ahead and find another image that is

90

00:04:51,610  -->  00:04:54,729
a png, do I have any? How about this right

91

00:04:54,729  -->  00:05:02,910
here, let's use that.

92

00:05:02,910  -->  00:05:10,170
Rename this to placeholder.png and now

93

00:05:10,170  -->  00:05:12,900
if we refresh the one post that didn't

94

00:05:12,900  -->  00:05:14,280
have an image you'll see it now has a

95

00:05:14,280  -->  00:05:17,010
placeholder image, and any new post is going

96

00:05:17,010  -->  00:05:19,050
to use whatever we defined as the

97

00:05:19,050  -->  00:05:21,480
placeholder image unless we override

98

00:05:21,480  -->  00:05:26,460
that. So make sure you do that, so again set

99

00:05:26,460  -->  00:05:29,370
an image property of your post, set it to

100

00:05:29,370  -->  00:05:33,210
models.ImageField with the default

101

00:05:33,210  -->  00:05:36,840
argument upload to equal to image, this

102

00:05:36,840  -->  00:05:38,490
is going to store that in the media

103

00:05:38,490  -->  00:05:42,540
image directory. Now in our templates

104

00:05:42,540  -->  00:05:47,880
here open up the index page and the way

105

00:05:47,880  -->  00:05:49,590
that you're going to display that is right

106

00:05:49,590  -->  00:05:54,720
here. You're going to open up a variable

107

00:05:54,720  -->  00:05:56,580
input here and you're going to type

108

00:05:56,580  -->  00:06:00,990
post.image.URL, or if you were to name

109

00:06:00,990  -->  00:06:04,890
this like img like that what you would

110

00:06:04,890  -->  00:06:07,860
do in here is use that same property, so

111

00:06:07,860  -->  00:06:09,870
if you are accessing the image property

112

00:06:09,870  -->  00:06:12,660
whatever we called it and then the URL

113

00:06:12,660  -->  00:06:19,790
property of the image.

114

00:06:19,790  -->  00:06:22,160
So that's one big change that I made the

115

00:06:22,160  -->  00:06:26,570
ability to add images there,

116

00:06:26,570  -->  00:06:29,450
the other big change that I've made is

117

00:06:29,450  -->  00:06:33,740
in the post.

118

00:06:33,740  -->  00:06:37,460
So, when we go to a single post you'll

119

00:06:37,460  -->  00:06:39,920
notice that we have the post itself and

120

00:06:39,920  -->  00:06:43,250
then we've also got some recent posts on

121

00:06:43,250  -->  00:06:44,510
the side we're going to be making a

122

00:06:44,510  -->  00:06:48,440
sidebar, and the way to do this is

123

00:06:48,440  -->  00:06:52,400
basically we first so there's the base

124

00:06:52,400  -->  00:06:54,500
layout right here, and then we're going

125

00:06:54,500  -->  00:06:57,230
to create a single template file which

126

00:06:57,230  -->  00:06:59,330
extends the base and this is going to

127

00:06:59,330  -->  00:07:02,840
contain the sidebar and then you create

128

00:07:02,840  -->  00:07:04,280
another block here which is going to be

129

00:07:04,280  -->  00:07:07,220
overwritten by the post page itself so

130

00:07:07,220  -->  00:07:09,830
in this case I'm calling entry, and then

131

00:07:09,830  -->  00:07:12,290
the post file here we just extend single

132

00:07:12,290  -->  00:07:14,690
template instead of base HTML and what

133

00:07:14,690  -->  00:07:16,490
that does is it puts this right here

134

00:07:16,490  -->  00:07:20,000
into this right here, and then this right

135

00:07:20,000  -->  00:07:24,890
here goes into that. So, we're extending

136

00:07:24,890  -->  00:07:27,260
and extending this is a three-level deep

137

00:07:27,260  -->  00:07:30,800
extension of a template I guess you call

138

00:07:30,800  -->  00:07:32,960
it. Something else I want to mention just

139

00:07:32,960  -->  00:07:34,730
very quick, how do you turn

140

00:07:34,730  -->  00:07:38,120
line breaks into HTML line breaks

141

00:07:38,120  -->  00:07:39,950
because that's something that we haven't

142

00:07:39,950  -->  00:07:43,370
done yet. So, in your post template you're

143

00:07:43,370  -->  00:07:45,410
going to print out post content, put a

144

00:07:45,410  -->  00:07:47,690
pipeline after that, and then

145

00:07:47,690  -->  00:07:50,780
line breaks keyword right there, that's

146

00:07:50,780  -->  00:07:56,300
all you have to do. So I guess another

147

00:07:56,300  -->  00:07:59,960
thing to mention is that in the post

148

00:07:59,960  -->  00:08:05,450
view I've got all posts instead of just

149

00:08:05,450  -->  00:08:08,810
the the one post based on the slug, and

150

00:08:08,810  -->  00:08:11,360
these posts are used to populate the sidebar,

151

00:08:11,360  -->  00:08:14,240
and then I pass in posts to the

152

00:08:14,240  -->  00:08:17,720
post.HTML page as a separate variable to post.

153

00:08:17,720  -->  00:08:19,880
So this is the single post right there

154

00:08:19,880  -->  00:08:22,400
this is all posts, and what you can do is

155

00:08:22,400  -->  00:08:23,960
it's going to go ahead and load the

156

00:08:23,960  -->  00:08:25,700
single template and then it's going to

157

00:08:25,700  -->  00:08:28,100
extend it from, or it's going to load the

158

00:08:28,100  -->  00:08:30,110
post HTML then it's going to extend it

159

00:08:30,110  -->  00:08:32,950
from this, so any variables that you have

160

00:08:32,950  -->  00:08:36,790
accessible in post.HTML is going to

161

00:08:36,790  -->  00:08:38,620
be accessible to higher levels as well,

162

00:08:38,620  -->  00:08:41,800
so here I just put a loop similar to how

163

00:08:41,800  -->  00:08:48,910
the index page used to be. So that's

164

00:08:48,910  -->  00:08:52,000
really the only improvements I've made,

165

00:08:52,000  -->  00:08:54,820
so we're going to, in the next video I

166

00:08:54,820  -->  00:08:56,620
mean, this kind of video is kinda catch

167

00:08:56,620  -->  00:08:58,570
up because a few changes were made and I

168

00:08:58,570  -->  00:08:59,920
didn't want to get you guys lost and I

169

00:08:59,920  -->  00:09:01,510
actually didn't intend to make all these

170

00:09:01,510  -->  00:09:02,410
changes.

171

00:09:02,410  -->  00:09:04,360
When I said I was just going to style

172

00:09:04,360  -->  00:09:05,650
it like well you know what we need

173

00:09:05,650  -->  00:09:09,310
images, you know, so I decided to do that,

174

00:09:09,310  -->  00:09:12,010
and I hope you guys understand how. I'm

175

00:09:12,010  -->  00:09:16,120
going to provide a written demonstration

176

00:09:16,120  -->  00:09:17,920
and put it in this discussion for this

177

00:09:17,920  -->  00:09:20,620
video just make sure. I think I've

178

00:09:20,620  -->  00:09:22,780
explained it well but you guys you might

179

00:09:22,780  -->  00:09:24,520
want to look at the some more example

180

00:09:24,520  -->  00:09:31,020
code and have access to it.
