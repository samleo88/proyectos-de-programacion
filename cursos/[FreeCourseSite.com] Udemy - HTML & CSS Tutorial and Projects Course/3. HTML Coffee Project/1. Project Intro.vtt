Well spending time in tutorial was a lot of fun.

00:03.780 --> 00:07.840
The real learning starts whenever we start creating the project.

00:07.890 --> 00:09.950
So this is gonna be our first project.

00:09.960 --> 00:15.830
We're going to use the knowledge that we learn about email to create our first site on the site is gonna

00:15.840 --> 00:17.200
be very basic.

00:17.210 --> 00:19.590
WE'RE ALL GONNA USE ONLY age email in the site.

00:19.770 --> 00:26.130
Well when I say only age email there's gonna be tiny bit now neither side is gonna start off with a

00:26.130 --> 00:31.530
logo and then I'm going gonna have a few pages then let's say for the homepage there's gonna be big

00:31.530 --> 00:32.640
banner image.

00:32.850 --> 00:38.460
Then we're looking for headings with future product and then let's say there's gonna be some kind of

00:38.460 --> 00:44.310
product or every product we're gonna have the details not the details is gonna be a link that's just

00:44.310 --> 00:49.790
gonna go to Wikipedia or as you can see we will then open it up in the new tab.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.420
Now there's gonna be three of them.

00:51.570 --> 00:57.990
There's gonna be house blend French roast and Colombian roast as well as all the way at the bottom we're

00:57.990 --> 01:02.880
gonna have link that's gonna scroll all the way up to the top of the page.

01:02.910 --> 01:06.220
Now this would be the homepage and we're looking for the about page.

01:06.370 --> 01:11.830
Again the navigation and the image is gonna be exactly the same as well as the background.

01:12.060 --> 01:15.670
However here we're going to have just some text about the company.

01:15.660 --> 01:22.110
Again we can click on back to the top and we're gonna be brought back to the top then in the numbers

01:22.140 --> 01:27.270
we're gonna have the table where there's just gonna be a little bit of information about the stores

01:27.270 --> 01:30.760
of the company and then we can scroll back to the top.

01:30.780 --> 01:36.450
Last but not least there's going to be contact where we have the contact form now in the contact form

01:36.450 --> 01:38.970
we can just enter some kind of information.

01:39.060 --> 01:41.070
Again let me read some gibberish.

01:41.070 --> 01:46.470
And obviously once we're gonna embedded this is gonna be displayed in your URL but we're not gonna be

01:46.470 --> 01:49.580
collecting this data in any way shape or form.

01:49.680 --> 01:53.370
Again we can go back to the home page and this is gonna be our homepage.

01:53.430 --> 01:54.990
So this is going to be our project.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.160
I hope you guys enjoy it.

01:56.220 --> 01:57.630
And let's start working on it.
