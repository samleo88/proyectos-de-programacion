WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:07.710
Once we have covered justify content as well as the on line items why don't we do a small project where

00:07.710 --> 00:11.250
in fact we do set up our hero component.

00:11.310 --> 00:17.610
Now when I say hero component I mean a massive background image and then within the background manage

00:17.970 --> 00:20.630
there's going to be some kind of title.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.160
Now first and foremost we're going to need one image.

00:24.330 --> 00:28.650
We only need one image so I'm going to head over to the pixels.

00:28.650 --> 00:32.040
Again you can download whatever image you like.

00:32.310 --> 00:33.420
I'm gonna go with.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.350
I don't know beach I guess.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.600
Let's go with beach.

00:38.160 --> 00:41.490
I think I'm gonna pick this one let's save images.

00:41.780 --> 00:44.260
I'm gonna save it in my project.

00:44.300 --> 00:53.420
So when this stop I have like mock sartorial and in here I'm gonna go with hero BCG OK something like

00:53.420 --> 00:53.810
that.

00:53.810 --> 00:55.840
That's step number one.

00:55.900 --> 01:01.610
And then let's roll back to our project and in fact I don't want to pollute the actual tutorial within

01:01.610 --> 01:03.100
the next session email.

01:03.200 --> 01:11.480
So we're gonna create a new file going gonna call this banner h t email again we're going to set up

01:11.540 --> 01:15.060
in fact our H mouse Carlton.

01:15.620 --> 01:17.600
That's number one.

01:17.600 --> 01:23.840
And then you know what may be within the next issue email why don't we set up a link so that way we

01:23.840 --> 01:25.910
can easily navigate back and forth.

01:26.300 --> 01:35.550
So right after the container I'm gonna set up a link and Link is gonna head over to a banner HD e-mail.

01:36.230 --> 01:39.490
Okay so where are you uh where are you.

01:39.490 --> 01:40.160
Link.

01:40.260 --> 01:42.170
Let's see let's see let's see let's see.

01:42.330 --> 01:46.640
And of course I can see the link because I didn't type anything manner aged yet.

01:46.960 --> 01:47.480
Okay.

01:47.560 --> 01:53.610
When we say it and of course I navigate to our page which currently is an empty page then let's head

01:53.610 --> 01:56.210
over back to the email once.

01:56.310 --> 01:57.040
Right.

01:57.050 --> 02:01.000
Banner example and so on.

02:01.010 --> 02:02.430
For some reason I deleted it.

02:02.980 --> 02:03.910
Let's save it.

02:03.920 --> 02:04.310
Okay.

02:04.310 --> 02:07.970
I do have my banner example that works out really well.

02:07.970 --> 02:13.540
Then I'm gonna set up the body and here within the body there's gonna be two things.

02:13.550 --> 02:19.280
So first of all we're gonna come up with a header element and we're just gonna add the class of hero

02:19.820 --> 02:29.020
and also let's place a hearing 1 like so with a our page title page title.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.200
Save that.

02:30.210 --> 02:30.660
Okay.

02:30.660 --> 02:32.430
That's already a good start.

02:32.490 --> 02:33.290
Let's refresh it.

02:33.300 --> 02:38.060
Now we can see it and you know it also lets and maybe a link back.

02:38.670 --> 02:39.570
Let's go with link.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.570
Let's go with index.

02:41.670 --> 02:46.990
I am out and back on something like that.

02:47.050 --> 02:48.730
Now next I like to set up.

02:48.760 --> 02:53.760
In fact my header which is not gonna use right now any flex box.

02:53.770 --> 02:57.250
But like I said I would want to create a hero component.

02:57.250 --> 03:03.400
So we're going to do something that we already have done few times before by setting up a background

03:03.460 --> 03:04.060
image.

03:04.060 --> 03:09.730
Now I could create an underclass solution and all that but in order to save time I'm just gonna go with

03:09.730 --> 03:10.530
style tags.

03:10.900 --> 03:17.200
And then within style tags why don't we first get rid of some default bindings and margins.

03:17.200 --> 03:21.000
So I'm going to write margin zero to all of them.

03:21.150 --> 03:22.050
And you're not.

03:22.150 --> 03:23.920
I think I can just skip the padding.

03:24.370 --> 03:31.240
Then as far as we have the header rect so let's target a hero class that's first and foremost.

03:31.470 --> 03:35.300
Let's add some background just so we can see where we are operating.

03:35.410 --> 03:37.150
And I'm gonna go with red.

03:37.260 --> 03:43.830
And then after that since we would like to place this title in fact in the center we're gonna have to

03:43.830 --> 03:44.440
have some height.

03:44.910 --> 03:51.020
And I do prefer using the viewport height because that doesn't set the absolute values.

03:51.090 --> 03:54.230
In fact it sets up the values for screen sizes right.

03:54.540 --> 04:00.870
So usually what I like to do is set up the mean height and I'm gonna go in this case with hundred percent.

04:00.870 --> 04:06.960
Now what this means is that even though the content of this particular component or I'm sorry element

04:06.990 --> 04:11.260
I guess is smaller or would be smaller than hundred percent.

04:11.310 --> 04:12.940
What I'm saying here is men height.

04:13.200 --> 04:18.840
So regardless of the content that's sitting within this element the height of this element is going

04:18.840 --> 04:19.950
to be a hundred percent.

04:20.010 --> 04:23.800
So as you can see the moment I start scrolling This is where I see the link.

04:24.330 --> 04:30.240
And the screen size this hundred percent is going to be whether on this stop or a phone or whatever.

04:30.330 --> 04:32.310
That's the reason why I like to set this up.

04:32.520 --> 04:38.860
Now instead of going for a background of just color or red in fact we're gonna set up our image.

04:39.270 --> 04:44.390
Now the syntax for that is you are all let's say is sitting here hero BCG.

04:44.670 --> 04:52.960
So let's type hero B C G and then the full extension is J.

04:53.310 --> 05:00.370
Okay the moment we set this up of course we do have our background image and everything works really

05:00.370 --> 05:00.900
well.

05:01.060 --> 05:03.910
And next to help there's few things that we will need to clean up.

05:04.030 --> 05:06.210
As far as the image is concerned.

05:06.220 --> 05:09.420
First of all probably would want to place it in the center.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.120
And you know what.

05:10.150 --> 05:11.650
In this case I'm gonna go.

05:11.650 --> 05:17.730
In fact with a long way instead of setting up everything within one line because I think it's gonna

05:17.740 --> 05:19.440
be easier for us to understand.

05:19.540 --> 05:25.210
So we have a background position and we need to set this in the center.

05:25.540 --> 05:27.880
So let's start with the center.

05:28.090 --> 05:30.250
So let's place the image in the center.

05:30.250 --> 05:38.530
Then we also like to use background and then we have the size background size and we're gonna go with

05:38.530 --> 05:46.390
cover to make sure that our background always covers the space that we have for our element and then

05:46.390 --> 05:54.680
also when we go with background repeat no repeat background repeat no repeat and optionally we can come

05:54.680 --> 05:59.080
up with fixed where the image is gonna stay fixed and enforced crawling.

05:59.090 --> 06:01.880
In fact we're going to have deeper likes effect.

06:02.150 --> 06:04.160
Now maybe I'm gonna leave that one for last.

06:04.160 --> 06:09.640
Because I'm mostly interested in working with this title in a setting this up in the center.

06:09.710 --> 06:16.340
So we have our image we have our awesome hero component and then our main goal is to place this title

06:16.700 --> 06:21.380
exactly in a center vertically as well as horizontally.

06:21.740 --> 06:28.760
Now first of all why don't we add some kind of parameters for our title where I'm going to go with let's

06:28.760 --> 06:35.100
say a text transform I'm pro case work.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.070
So that's number one.

06:37.070 --> 06:46.130
Then let's also go with font size bigger font size would say 60 pixels and maybe just so we can see

06:46.130 --> 06:47.830
it a little bit better.

06:47.990 --> 06:50.510
Why don't we go with color.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.890
I'm gonna go with red.

06:51.890 --> 06:53.350
Let's see how that works.

06:53.390 --> 06:54.680
I think it works fine.

06:54.680 --> 07:00.260
We have our page title and then like I said all the knowledge that we have from the Flex box.

07:00.260 --> 07:03.090
I'd like to use it to place it exactly in the center.

07:03.580 --> 07:07.040
And this is as easy as writing three lines of code.

07:07.850 --> 07:09.590
So first of all hero.

07:09.650 --> 07:13.430
Remember that is our parent container.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.670
And like I said the same thing works even if we have only one child.

07:18.690 --> 07:19.070
All right.

07:19.430 --> 07:26.720
So the same setup we have our Flex parent and then we have our Flex items that are our children and

07:26.720 --> 07:31.510
for the Flex parent first and foremost we set up display as flex.

07:31.540 --> 07:32.770
That's step number one.

07:33.060 --> 07:38.330
And then remember in order to set it up horizontally what we needed to use now we are justified content

07:38.720 --> 07:42.950
and instead of flex start why don't we just set it equal to the center.

07:43.020 --> 07:48.170
And now it's sitting in a center horizontally and then it would like to place it actually in the center

07:48.170 --> 07:49.560
vertically.

07:49.580 --> 07:54.120
It's as easy as it gets a line items and center and that's it.

07:54.120 --> 08:00.020
And literally with three lines of code and of course I'm not counting setting up this mean height and

08:00.020 --> 08:03.430
whatever whether we would like to have some background or background image.

08:03.440 --> 08:03.920
OK.

08:04.040 --> 08:04.880
I'm not counting that.

08:04.910 --> 08:10.560
So technically I'm a little bit cheating but the whole idea is very simple with three lines of code.

08:10.610 --> 08:12.790
We are setting up this in a center.

08:12.870 --> 08:18.700
And believe me prior to flex box it was much much more painful in order to do that.

08:19.250 --> 08:26.090
So that's the beauty of the Flex box where even though we have the grid and we can of course use the

08:26.090 --> 08:34.310
grid later on once we cover it I do still find it flex box very useful because it allows me to set some

08:34.460 --> 08:37.370
type of layouts very very quickly.

08:37.370 --> 08:42.470
Now lastly like I said I would like to cover how we can background attachment fixed.

08:42.470 --> 08:46.090
So why don't we do this let's say right after the header.

08:46.700 --> 08:54.250
I'm gonna go with Dev on that has a class of banner banner linked so I'm gonna leave it empty.

08:54.400 --> 09:01.600
And as far as banner is concerned again I'm gonna go with banner main height is going to be again hundred

09:01.600 --> 09:09.100
v height just so I can see that it is a hundred percent of the screen background is going to be color

09:09.140 --> 09:12.280
of I don't know blue and.

09:12.280 --> 09:13.130
Like so.

09:13.300 --> 09:21.130
And then you'll notice that is going to be of course my banner and then let's set up a background attachment

09:21.640 --> 09:23.290
for my image.

09:23.290 --> 09:25.380
And again this has nothing to do with the flex box.

09:25.390 --> 09:30.410
This is just has this attachment effect that creates that parallax effect.

09:30.610 --> 09:38.740
So background attachment fixed and once we set it up for our hero a number does not put a banner.

09:38.740 --> 09:39.890
This is for the hero.

09:39.910 --> 09:46.780
Now this gives you as you can see as we're scrolling we have this parallax effect where before if we

09:46.780 --> 09:53.130
don't have it as you can see the whole page scrolls the same way but if we have this background attachment

09:53.130 --> 09:56.110
a fixed well we do have this parallax effect.

09:56.140 --> 10:01.970
Now we do need to be careful though because some forms do not support us.

10:02.260 --> 10:08.380
So when you're setting this up as you're looking at your project on a phone while the phones are not

10:08.380 --> 10:09.240
going to support it.

10:09.270 --> 10:14.800
So you need to be careful about that but like I said our main goal was to show that with three lines

10:14.800 --> 10:21.070
of code now that we know in fact flex box well we can set up everything in the center whether that's

10:21.070 --> 10:22.870
horizontally or vertically.
