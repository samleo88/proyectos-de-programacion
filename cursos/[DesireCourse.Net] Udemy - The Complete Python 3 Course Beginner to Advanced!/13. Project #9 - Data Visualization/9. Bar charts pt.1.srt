1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,190
Alright guys, so there's a few more

2

00:00:02,190  -->  00:00:03,840
things that I want to cover when it

3

00:00:03,840  -->  00:00:06,420
comes to data visualization, and so this

4

00:00:06,420  -->  00:00:08,730
video is going to be about bar charts,

5

00:00:08,730  -->  00:00:10,230
but it's also going to be about mapping

6

00:00:10,230  -->  00:00:14,130
out some more data than just like

7

00:00:14,130  -->  00:00:16,199
one or two lines. So we're going to be

8

00:00:16,199  -->  00:00:18,000
making a bar chart and the bar chart

9

00:00:18,000  -->  00:00:19,859
we're going to be making is going to be

10

00:00:19,859  -->  00:00:24,180
based on different subjects from school

11

00:00:24,180  -->  00:00:28,320
scores, the average score or country on

12

00:00:28,320  -->  00:00:31,590
these subjects. So what I mean is if I

13

00:00:31,590  -->  00:00:33,750
open up safari here I've got a chart

14

00:00:33,750  -->  00:00:38,070
here that spells out basically the

15

00:00:38,070  -->  00:00:40,110
scores, and we're going to be using the first

16

00:00:40,110  -->  00:00:43,170
column the mean score here, and it's

17

00:00:43,170  -->  00:00:45,390
going to be based on the year 2012. And

18

00:00:45,390  -->  00:00:46,890
we're going to be choosing a few of

19

00:00:46,890  -->  00:00:48,360
these countries and then putting in the

20

00:00:48,360  -->  00:00:53,129
data for each subject here, math, reading,

21

00:00:53,129  -->  00:00:56,070
and science, so that we can visualize it

22

00:00:56,070  -->  00:00:58,859
because having exact numbers is neat but,

23

00:00:58,859  -->  00:01:00,420
this is difficult to read especially

24

00:01:00,420  -->  00:01:02,250
when you're trying to

25

00:01:02,250  -->  00:01:05,309
trace and then compare numbers. A lot of

26

00:01:05,309  -->  00:01:07,409
numbers are similar and that's why that

27

00:01:07,409  -->  00:01:09,479
doesn't really work. Not that it is

28

00:01:09,479  -->  00:01:12,930
impossible or difficult to do, I'm pretty

29

00:01:12,930  -->  00:01:15,509
sure we can all read numbers, however it's

30

00:01:15,509  -->  00:01:17,250
just easier sometimes to take a quick

31

00:01:17,250  -->  00:01:20,159
glance at a chart, and be presented with the

32

00:01:20,159  -->  00:01:22,530
same information just in a more visual

33

00:01:22,530  -->  00:01:25,740
way. So what we're going to be doing here

34

00:01:25,740  -->  00:01:29,430
is first we need to import a few things.

35

00:01:29,430  -->  00:01:33,360
We're going to be using just pyplot

36

00:01:33,360  -->  00:01:36,840
for this I guess, so import matplotlib.

37

00:01:36,840  -->  00:01:43,020
pyplot as plt. We're going to be using

38

00:01:43,020  -->  00:01:47,850
the same thing here, and so let's plot

39

00:01:47,850  -->  00:01:50,100
out some of this data. Let's start with

40

00:01:50,100  -->  00:01:58,020
Korea here, so Korea scores. Now let's go

41

00:01:58,020  -->  00:02:00,780
ahead and create a tuple, and the first

42

00:02:00,780  -->  00:02:03,719
one is 554, that's their

43

00:02:03,719  -->  00:02:06,630
average score at mathematics, and now see

44

00:02:06,630  -->  00:02:08,340
I have to trace the line over in order

45

00:02:08,340  -->  00:02:10,940
to get the correct number, 536

46

00:02:10,940  -->  00:02:19,370
in reading, and then pull this over even more, and then 538

47

00:02:19,370  -->  00:02:22,430
in science. So as you can see it

48

00:02:22,430  -->  00:02:25,370
takes you quite a while to to be able to

49

00:02:25,370  -->  00:02:27,440
grab each number that you want to, and that's

50

00:02:27,440  -->  00:02:28,880
why we're going to be putting this into

51

00:02:28,880  -->  00:02:38,750
a chart. Let's go with Canada. Alright, so,

52

00:02:38,750  -->  00:02:46,910
Canada math is 518, and now I'm going to

53

00:02:46,910  -->  00:02:50,570
trace this again way over here, 523,

54

00:02:50,570  -->  00:03:00,560
and 525, and this is gonna kind of be

55

00:03:00,560  -->  00:03:02,510
boring because this chart is actually

56

00:03:02,510  -->  00:03:06,680
already organized from most to least. So you could

57

00:03:06,680  -->  00:03:08,450
just read the list here and find out you

58

00:03:08,450  -->  00:03:12,710
know who has the higher mean score,

59

00:03:12,710  -->  00:03:22,520
but, yeah. So, let's add in a Shanghai,

60

00:03:22,520  -->  00:03:27,620
China, so China scores. I'm going to create another

61

00:03:27,620  -->  00:03:29,720
tuple, and that's the first row here so it's

62

00:03:29,720  -->  00:03:32,420
going to be easier, 613

63

00:03:32,420  -->  00:03:39,350
for math, 570 for reading, then 580 for

64

00:03:39,350  -->  00:03:41,720
science. And then one more, let's go ahead

65

00:03:41,720  -->  00:03:50,570
with France. So, france_scores, so

66

00:03:50,570  -->  00:03:55,720
we're gonna say math is 495,

67

00:03:59,480  -->  00:04:06,080
reading is 505, and 499. Alright,

68

00:04:06,080  -->  00:04:12,709
so, I've got all my data plotted out here,

69

00:04:12,709  -->  00:04:15,349
well I've got it collected now and

70

00:04:15,349  -->  00:04:17,959
arranged, so what we're going to do is

71

00:04:17,959  -->  00:04:24,410
we're going to, I'm going to show you

72

00:04:24,410  -->  00:04:26,360
guys just one thing printed out, and

73

00:04:26,360  -->  00:04:28,130
we're gonna have a problem when we try

74

00:04:28,130  -->  00:04:29,419
and add a second line. So let's go ahead

75

00:04:29,419  -->  00:04:35,660
and we're going to say k1 equals...we

76

00:04:35,660  -->  00:04:37,580
don't have a lot there so let's go ahead

77

00:04:37,580  -->  00:04:47,900
and include numpy as well. import numpy as np,

78

00:04:47,900  -->  00:04:51,199
and what we're going to do with that is

79

00:04:51,199  -->  00:04:54,260
we're going to create an integer

80

00:04:54,260  -->  00:04:59,000
variable with how many of these values

81

00:04:59,000  -->  00:05:03,350
each item has, or how many columns each

82

00:05:03,350  -->  00:05:11,120
will create, so in this case col_count

83

00:05:11,120  -->  00:05:14,270
equals three, and we're going to need to

84

00:05:14,270  -->  00:05:18,950
use this to manually space

85

00:05:18,950  -->  00:05:24,919
some of our things. And then in order to

86

00:05:24,919  -->  00:05:26,690
iterate to we're going to create a range,

87

00:05:26,690  -->  00:05:32,479
so index equals np.arange, we're

88

00:05:32,479  -->  00:05:35,419
going to pass in the column count. And

89

00:05:35,419  -->  00:05:38,450
now this is going to act as the x-axis

90

00:05:38,450  -->  00:05:40,190
for us, so we don't actually need to

91

00:05:40,190  -->  00:05:43,430
create an x-axis at this point. We're

92

00:05:43,430  -->  00:05:48,470
just going to pass in index, and you'll

93

00:05:48,470  -->  00:05:50,870
see why we're doing this in a moment. Now

94

00:05:50,870  -->  00:05:55,490
what we need to do is pass in the y-axis

95

00:05:55,490  -->  00:05:59,210
which is vertical, so it's Korea stores,

96

00:05:59,210  -->  00:06:06,770
the bar width for right now let's

97

00:06:06,770  -->  00:06:10,310
just leave this as is. Let's drop down

98

00:06:10,310  -->  00:06:11,870
here a few lines and I'm just going to

99

00:06:11,870  -->  00:06:12,590
show the chart, because

100

00:06:12,590  -->  00:06:14,780
this is where we're going to start. So

101

00:06:14,780  -->  00:06:21,470
plt.show. So I'm going to save this and run

102

00:06:21,470  -->  00:06:29,090
the program here, and I don't have

103

00:06:29,090  -->  00:06:40,460
anything happening. Let me find out why,

104

00:06:40,460  -->  00:06:46,550
that's weird. Label is Korea, let's add a

105

00:06:46,550  -->  00:06:58,460
color, so

106

00:06:58,460  -->  00:07:08,270
.3, .3, .7...

107

00:07:08,270  -->  00:07:11,980
...

108

00:07:14,620  -->  00:07:17,199
Okay, something terrible just happened,

109

00:07:17,199  -->  00:07:21,580
and I can't figure this out. Okay, let me

110

00:07:21,580  -->  00:07:23,199
see what's wrong. I'm going to erase this

111

00:07:23,199  -->  00:07:25,120
because something went terribly wrong

112

00:07:25,120  -->  00:07:31,780
there, and I'm going to redo this. Korea

113

00:07:31,780  -->  00:07:39,790
scores, and then the bar width let's set

114

00:07:39,790  -->  00:07:44,020
to .5 right now, and now let's drop down

115

00:07:44,020  -->  00:07:47,560
here and put color. Why is it doing that,

116

00:07:47,560  -->  00:07:56,229
when I'm trying to add the color? Oh, okay,

117

00:07:56,229  -->  00:07:59,380
well I feel a bit silly right now. I'm

118

00:07:59,380  -->  00:08:01,030
just creating a

119

00:08:01,030  -->  00:08:02,530
tuple here, I'm not actually creating a

120

00:08:02,530  -->  00:08:05,800
chart, so obviously this is a method of

121

00:08:05,800  -->  00:08:08,650
the plt class or object that we're using

122

00:08:08,650  -->  00:08:11,470
right now. So, plt.bar and that's where

123

00:08:11,470  -->  00:08:13,150
we pass in all these variables, and

124

00:08:13,150  -->  00:08:14,979
that will actually create the charts. Now

125

00:08:14,979  -->  00:08:18,250
if I start it you will see this chart

126

00:08:18,250  -->  00:08:20,830
right here. We're going to add a grid

127

00:08:20,830  -->  00:08:22,930
just so that we can better identify between

128

00:08:22,930  -->  00:08:26,080
the different subjects. So plt.grid is

129

00:08:26,080  -->  00:08:30,190
going to be true. Now when I restart this

130

00:08:30,190  -->  00:08:31,270
we're going to see a grid on the

131

00:08:31,270  -->  00:08:36,159
background there. Makes it easier to find

132

00:08:36,159  -->  00:08:38,760
out what goes where.
