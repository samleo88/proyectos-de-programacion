WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:02.460
Pressure of the form submission.

00:02.460 --> 00:08.090
We would like to finish here with our Web site at least to the point where we're gonna be heading over

00:08.130 --> 00:12.070
back to number and now button and here we just have the footer.

00:12.150 --> 00:18.310
So it's safe to say that I think we're gonna finish everything here in one video where the HD UML and

00:18.310 --> 00:24.000
easy access is gonna be had it all let's start probably by creating the footer element and we right

00:24.000 --> 00:25.960
away we're gonna give it a class of four.

00:26.070 --> 00:31.770
Also I'd like to use the section center that was for our pairings and for the layout overall.

00:32.250 --> 00:39.950
So let's use Section center and within the section center let's create another div so we'll show so

00:40.230 --> 00:41.980
show icons.

00:41.990 --> 00:45.450
That's gonna be the name and what I would like to do here.

00:45.460 --> 00:50.050
Well let's create three icons all of them are gonna be links and they're all gonna be linking to the

00:50.050 --> 00:52.320
Facebook to Twitter and Instagram.

00:52.690 --> 00:59.470
So I'm going to say first of all there's gonna be a comment social icon that's gonna be the first thing

00:59.910 --> 01:05.350
I'm going to copy and paste it I'm gonna say end of social icon and then let's create our link let's

01:05.350 --> 01:11.230
say there's gonna be a link link for now is gonna be the dummy link but I would like to add a class

01:11.230 --> 01:21.000
of social icon and let's write what we would want and that would be a font awesome icon f a b though

01:21.270 --> 01:27.130
in this case this is going to be different and then we're gonna be looking for f a Facebook.

01:27.190 --> 01:29.240
So this should give us the Facebook icon.

01:29.520 --> 01:36.130
And yeah we have our Facebook icon now what we can do right now is just copy and paste this let's say

01:36.160 --> 01:37.980
that I would want to more.

01:38.030 --> 01:41.200
1 2 obviously here we're going to be changing the values.

01:41.470 --> 01:45.220
When I say then this is not going to be Twitter or I'm sorry Facebook.

01:45.220 --> 01:50.560
This is gonna be Instagram Instagram something like this.

01:50.560 --> 01:54.640
And then let's go up and let's say with here we're gonna be looking for Twitter.

01:54.700 --> 01:56.830
So those are gonna be my social media icons.

01:57.430 --> 02:02.470
I also would like to add that paragraph what I was talking about about the copyright.

02:02.560 --> 02:03.550
So let me double check.

02:03.550 --> 02:10.810
So within the section centre and outside the social icons there's going to be paragraph the class is

02:10.810 --> 02:14.900
gonna be put out text and within the paragraph let's add right away.

02:14.900 --> 02:15.690
Copy symbol.

02:16.690 --> 02:18.160
So right copy.

02:18.220 --> 02:26.410
Then we're adding the semicolon and let's do maybe some span span and within the span we can right away.

02:26.430 --> 02:26.820
Right.

02:26.840 --> 02:30.250
The station the station.

02:30.500 --> 02:37.220
And if you remember all the way in the beginning we added this global class where the colour of the

02:37.220 --> 02:38.960
text would be primary.

02:38.960 --> 02:44.510
So now we can just use this class and say text Prime Mary.

02:44.870 --> 02:46.170
Yeah we have our T station.

02:46.530 --> 02:47.310
What else.

02:47.310 --> 02:51.090
Well right after this panel let's just place a dot and let's say.

02:51.090 --> 02:59.160
All rights reserved something like this should be an outraged email after the HRC email where I was

02:59.290 --> 03:04.210
gonna set up everything in the sea assess where again we're not gonna have a bunch of rules anyway.

03:04.210 --> 03:10.660
So here I can just say end of contact and we can technically write footer but again it's gonna be the

03:10.660 --> 03:18.030
last one anyway so I can write for a class background is gonna be main dark so it's right.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.060
Main dark is gonna be in the background this is how it's gonna look like.

03:21.340 --> 03:25.450
Then we can also align everything in the center stone center.

03:25.450 --> 03:28.800
Now everything is sitting nicely for social icon.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.190
For each and every icon what I would like.

03:32.190 --> 03:40.620
Well we can do different color so I'm going to see a color and that one is gonna be main white so main

03:40.620 --> 03:47.430
white color as well as I wouldn't want it a little bit bigger font size so font size would be I don't

03:47.430 --> 03:49.470
know one point three are.

03:49.540 --> 03:53.010
Now this is gonna be bigger than we can also do margin right.

03:53.040 --> 03:56.950
So there's gonna be a little bit of margin one hour I guess.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.790
Something like this.

03:58.810 --> 03:59.810
Now it's gonna be bigger.

04:00.360 --> 04:04.860
And also let's right away at the transition because I would like to add the hover effect so we might

04:04.860 --> 04:10.580
as well have the main transition since we have been using it all throughout the project.

04:10.780 --> 04:11.080
Yeah.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.910
So social.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.640
SOCIAL icon.

04:14.770 --> 04:16.070
Now it's gonna be the name.

04:16.110 --> 04:18.610
So as we're hovering what should happen.

04:18.720 --> 04:19.610
Let's change the color.

04:19.620 --> 04:22.050
Let's say color is gonna be primary color.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.390
So now the color is gonna be green.

04:24.510 --> 04:27.390
So I'm gonna be hovering now the color is going to be changing.

04:27.410 --> 04:28.240
Awesome.

04:28.260 --> 04:35.090
And last but not least we have the text of the text and text transform.

04:35.170 --> 04:40.110
Let's have it as a pillow case and case color is gonna be made white.

04:41.540 --> 04:44.820
Color is gonna be main white right here.

04:44.840 --> 04:50.510
Now I can see this is gonna be our main color apart from the one that we have it in our primary color

04:50.960 --> 04:52.360
because we added the class of course.

04:52.820 --> 04:54.840
Let's add maybe some letter spacing.

04:55.300 --> 05:01.580
So it's gonna be just a little regular letter spacing so I can just say letter spacing and a little

05:01.580 --> 05:03.650
bit of margin to the top.

05:03.650 --> 05:03.980
I don't know.

05:03.980 --> 05:05.230
One hour Ms.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.430
Thing that should do.

05:06.590 --> 05:07.330
And you know what.

05:07.340 --> 05:15.070
Let's maybe decrease the font size a little bit silly font size zero point eight five Ari.

05:15.110 --> 05:16.500
Ms.

05:16.550 --> 05:20.930
So now the font size is gonna be smaller and yeah we're done with our footer.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.810
And next one up is gonna be this snap button.

05:23.950 --> 05:25.410
So there's gonna be now button.

05:25.600 --> 05:31.030
We're also going to look at the now bar and last but not least we're gonna figure out how we can attach

05:31.390 --> 05:37.450
the javascript so we have this effect where if I'm clicking I'm getting the nav bar if I'm clicking

05:37.450 --> 05:39.880
on X the nav bar is disappearing.
