WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:03.040
And the next section we're going to be building.

00:03.420 --> 00:08.980
It's going to be quote section where we're actually going to be using a our carousel.

00:09.010 --> 00:15.050
So again first things are still going to build a section and then we're actually going to add a jack

00:15.050 --> 00:17.580
work plug in our carousel.

00:17.920 --> 00:23.170
So we're going to do this again we're going to go to where is the pricing section.

00:23.170 --> 00:28.200
You know we're going to create hear a comment and we're going to say this is going to be quote.

00:28.410 --> 00:31.750
And so the line copy paste.

00:31.970 --> 00:32.330
Right.

00:32.400 --> 00:38.950
And of quote You know this and then we're going to say that section right.

00:38.970 --> 00:43.300
And we're going to have an ID of quotes like this.

00:43.440 --> 00:48.510
And then once we have the section first things first we would want a title right.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.740
So we're going to skip over here and we're going to find it.

00:51.740 --> 00:55.740
Where is actually our title here.

00:55.760 --> 01:04.550
So if this was the pricing and so against just get this this title here come and see.

01:04.580 --> 01:06.360
So I'm going to copy this one.

01:06.600 --> 01:12.890
I'm going to go back over here and you can see that actually here in the quote I'm going to copy and

01:12.890 --> 01:16.780
paste this right and all he'll then have a icon.

01:17.060 --> 01:17.350
Right.

01:17.390 --> 01:20.190
And this is going to be a comment.

01:20.360 --> 01:27.500
This is going to be our font or some I can comment on here it's going to say our amazing and we're going

01:27.500 --> 01:29.360
to say what they say.

01:29.420 --> 01:35.930
So instead of our amazing prices we're going to say what they say and say what they were going to say

01:35.930 --> 01:37.080
say.

01:37.670 --> 01:46.120
And then once we're done with this we actually would want to start working with our main section in

01:46.220 --> 01:49.740
all year with them end of title.

01:49.780 --> 01:58.760
First we're going to create a div and there is going to have a class quote here and center and then

01:58.760 --> 02:02.250
we're going to add two things that we actually going to be using for Alcoa or so.

02:02.390 --> 02:05.390
So maybe right now they're not going to make much sense.

02:05.450 --> 02:05.810
Right.

02:05.930 --> 02:09.290
But I'm going to go over why we actually added these classes right.

02:09.290 --> 02:10.890
So don't worry about right now.

02:10.880 --> 02:17.060
It does make sense when you're writing all curso because those are actually classes that we need to

02:17.060 --> 02:25.790
add if we want our culture to be working and then we'll have all the this press tab and now we have

02:25.790 --> 02:32.660
heard and on the first things first we're going to have a image with this source on here we're going

02:32.660 --> 02:37.990
to see images and not say we're going to use images of team number four.

02:38.480 --> 02:45.860
So I'm going to say team number four here and we're going to have a team number where you can see them

02:45.920 --> 02:46.890
stop.

02:46.940 --> 02:48.650
Now we have it here.

02:48.650 --> 02:49.940
We're going to say alternative.

02:49.960 --> 02:57.740
We're just going to say an image like this cause it right now again this image is very big for an hour

02:57.740 --> 02:57.980
right.

02:57.980 --> 03:03.860
So don't worry about it we're obviously going to be actually making it smaller and after We're going

03:03.860 --> 03:14.380
to have a block quote mark cowrote element and they are and this is going to have a paragraph and the

03:14.380 --> 03:16.390
paragraph is going to have I.

03:16.720 --> 03:21.030
And then we're going to say you know the golden rule right.

03:21.070 --> 03:27.880
So we're going to say is this going to be I see or hear within the paragraph.

03:28.450 --> 03:38.290
And then in the paragraph know this and this is going to be if they fake quote quote We're going to

03:38.290 --> 03:44.240
say we left left or here and then we're going to press the tab.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.100
I'm going to we're going to have a subtext.

03:47.270 --> 03:47.570
Right.

03:47.650 --> 03:54.050
So this is going to be blockquote here within the paragraph we're going to still add some text.

03:54.060 --> 03:56.070
Right so this is going to be warum.

03:56.270 --> 03:59.310
What's going on some time words right.

03:59.330 --> 04:05.480
What he would say and then we're going to have the actual footage for a black block or so this is going

04:05.480 --> 04:14.370
to be her and we're all going to say a customer customers know this and we're actually done with this

04:14.370 --> 04:20.650
one right now the only thing here I may say actually is going to be a article.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.890
So we need to actually wrap all this.

04:22.900 --> 04:27.110
So I'm going to say article class quote press tab.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.150
Now what I would want to do is get this going on here.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.630
Price cut number here.

04:33.670 --> 04:40.000
If this was actual live right over here I would want to add an article.

04:40.010 --> 04:40.260
Right.

04:40.260 --> 04:44.650
So still this center right then it will have some children.

04:44.700 --> 04:45.410
Right.

04:45.550 --> 04:45.940
Right.

04:46.040 --> 04:51.760
And our to have one to an hour here and we're going to do all is going to change this to six.

04:51.790 --> 04:52.070
Right.

04:52.070 --> 04:54.540
And this is going to be image number six.

04:54.630 --> 04:56.740
This is going to be image number five.

04:57.010 --> 04:59.680
So right so this is going to change the image images.

04:59.950 --> 05:05.740
Now we're going to say this and again we're going to go to Maine see this and we just need to stop it.

05:05.790 --> 05:09.350
And then at the very end we're going out on our cause.

05:09.620 --> 05:12.440
So we're going to we're going to have a comment.

05:12.450 --> 05:13.040
Right.

05:13.080 --> 05:18.800
So we're all going to say that this is going to be quote quote here and another hash tag.

05:19.170 --> 05:19.490
Right.

05:19.530 --> 05:24.190
And then when we're going to do will hear what is going to create some more room.

05:24.300 --> 05:31.530
Mean once we have this one here we're going to say hash tag quote and over here we're going to say first

05:31.530 --> 05:35.050
that this is going to be padding 40 pixels.

05:35.180 --> 05:35.550
Right.

05:35.580 --> 05:36.690
And then zero.

05:36.930 --> 05:43.200
So 40 pixels top Marnham and we're going to have a background here right away we're going to have a

05:43.420 --> 05:45.390
huge roll over here.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.170
We're going to say quote background.

05:47.330 --> 05:49.790
So I saved this image with the photographs.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.180
Some would say images.

05:51.180 --> 05:53.610
And then we're going to say where is the quote.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.570
And we want codes back.

05:55.760 --> 05:59.700
Right so this is going to be the image that I'm going to be using for here.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.450
We're going to add some more stuff.

06:01.450 --> 06:02.080
All right.

06:02.210 --> 06:05.370
And first we're going to say that we would want it in a center right.

06:05.370 --> 06:09.430
And again we're going to be writing it a shorthand version right.

06:09.510 --> 06:10.890
We're going to take cover.

06:11.170 --> 06:11.530
All right.

06:11.540 --> 06:16.150
So Eamon should cover it and we're going to say it's going to be fixed.

06:16.300 --> 06:19.510
I'm going to say no repeat or here on this.

06:19.530 --> 06:19.930
Right.

06:20.100 --> 06:26.640
So all those things that we actually wrote as a property rule we just made over here a simple one right.

06:26.790 --> 06:28.810
I mean the way shorthand version.

06:28.860 --> 06:33.950
Real oddly near grade end here.

06:34.070 --> 06:37.940
And again we're going to have someone here great and this is going to be the black one.

06:38.010 --> 06:46.330
So our GPA 0 0 0 point let's say seven right and we're here we need the next one.

06:46.330 --> 06:48.420
So I'm going to say our GPA.

06:48.650 --> 06:52.840
Zero zero zero point seven.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.360
Right so pretty dark.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.880
And don't forget to place a comma here.

06:56.880 --> 07:03.580
And so now we have a black background and over here what we want is title heading to be different color

07:03.580 --> 07:04.130
again.

07:04.420 --> 07:07.550
So again we're going to say we're here that counts.

07:07.560 --> 07:12.280
I'm going to say title adding more here like this.

07:12.530 --> 07:13.790
And that's going to be color.

07:13.870 --> 07:15.920
I going to say hashtag FFC.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.770
Nine one for this.

07:18.850 --> 07:27.520
So now I'd start working with this quote article right and let's do first the image so then we can see

07:27.520 --> 07:29.140
everything else that we're doing.

07:29.140 --> 07:36.220
So we're here to say class quote and I'm going to say image here and we're going to say that this is

07:36.220 --> 07:41.580
going to be with let's say here hundred fifty pixels or right.

07:41.680 --> 07:45.520
So now we have a with then we're going to do more here.

07:45.580 --> 07:48.210
Imagine this.

07:48.430 --> 07:57.850
So I'm going to say a margin and that's going to be zero 0 0 overhearing this then we want a border

07:57.860 --> 08:00.540
radius and we're going to say 150 pixels.

08:00.670 --> 08:07.840
Right so we're going to say a border reuse and we're going to say it's say 50 percent.

08:08.080 --> 08:16.060
I realize now obviously what we would want to do right now is actually what we would want it if we want

08:16.060 --> 08:21.570
to place in center where I also would want a fuller quote to text the line.

08:22.110 --> 08:29.530
So let's go back over here and we're going to say quote here and for the code talkers say text align

08:30.370 --> 08:34.680
center and so non-sexually sitting in the center.

08:35.050 --> 08:45.690
And then after that we would want is a color that five three or five here and padding twenty pixels

08:45.870 --> 08:48.120
and or year zero.

08:48.170 --> 08:55.590
So this is going to be for the image and then will have a margin 20 pixels and zero here right.

08:55.620 --> 09:02.080
So the same thing for the paddings and we're also getting a much now what you would want so margin is

09:02.100 --> 09:05.280
obviously going to be in between and padding is inside here.

09:05.330 --> 09:11.710
Right then now we would want to actually style the font awesome right.

09:11.890 --> 09:16.780
So here what we're going to say is for the quote awesome right.

09:16.900 --> 09:22.450
And for a paragraph and then phantasmal here is this we're this color.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.170
Right.

09:23.230 --> 09:30.540
So we're going to say we're here quote We're going to say something like this and we're going to say

09:30.540 --> 09:40.480
font size 35 would say 35 pixels on this 10 and we're going to have a margin.

09:40.620 --> 09:42.500
We're going to say margin right.

09:43.630 --> 09:53.860
And this right this is going to be a five pixels here and then we're going to have a color right and

09:53.860 --> 09:59.540
the color is going to be actually FFC nine for color.

09:59.780 --> 10:03.870
And we're going to say hash tag see nine on four.

10:04.020 --> 10:08.160
Now we need to go and check because I'm actually not selecting.

10:08.180 --> 10:08.700
All right.

10:09.050 --> 10:11.120
So let's go back over here.

10:11.470 --> 10:17.540
Let's go to the next and see where it is actually my match up right now.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.870
I have a f a.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.200
You can see I didn't delete this right.

10:22.220 --> 10:27.120
So now I have all here this my quote and the same thing over here.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.480
Right so very quote.

10:29.480 --> 10:33.200
Now you can see that what we were actually doing right so we had to find that some.

10:33.470 --> 10:36.340
And we were actually adding a color to it.

10:36.380 --> 10:36.950
Right.

10:37.060 --> 10:41.810
So here this was called left and then we have somewhere in one more.

10:41.840 --> 10:42.510
Right.

10:42.530 --> 10:44.650
So here is this is going to be the same thing.

10:44.660 --> 10:45.310
Right.

10:45.380 --> 10:53.140
So now we have a class of font Awesomes and then we're going to have a font size margin right and car.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.120
Now we're done with this.

10:55.210 --> 11:02.590
The last rule we're going to have is going to be for paragraph and for the quote paragraph quote here

11:02.600 --> 11:07.270
paragraph what we would want is over here pretty simple right.

11:07.310 --> 11:15.350
So here we're going to say a line height 1.5 and this will have a with I would say we're going to say

11:15.440 --> 11:26.160
80 80 percent here and that margin let's say 10 pixels and we're going to say Arto like this.

11:26.210 --> 11:33.320
Now if you're wondering why we're not doing anything responsibly because actually the all cursor is

11:33.320 --> 11:34.840
going to take care of this.

11:34.940 --> 11:35.230
All right.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.370
So for now this is going to look like this.

11:37.610 --> 11:40.140
And once we add a how.

11:40.280 --> 11:44.590
So he's going to make everything responsive here.

11:44.630 --> 11:45.030
Right.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.850
So let's go ahead and let's add all colors.
