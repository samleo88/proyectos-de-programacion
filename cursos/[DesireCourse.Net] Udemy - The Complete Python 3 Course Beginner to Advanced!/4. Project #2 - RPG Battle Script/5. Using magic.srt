1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,979
Alright guys, an infinite battle when

2

00:00:01,979  -->  00:00:04,170
your hit points are zero is not very fun

3

00:00:04,170  -->  00:00:06,629
because you can just keep going and

4

00:00:06,629  -->  00:00:08,400
there's no sense of achievement when you

5

00:00:08,400  -->  00:00:10,800
finally defeat the enemy just because

6

00:00:10,800  -->  00:00:12,509
your hit points have been 0 a long time

7

00:00:12,509  -->  00:00:15,120
ago, and even still you're both dead and it

8

00:00:15,120  -->  00:00:17,160
still goes. So, what we need to do is

9

00:00:17,160  -->  00:00:19,680
determine if the battle is over. So at

10

00:00:19,680  -->  00:00:22,650
the end of the while loop here, in each

11

00:00:22,650  -->  00:00:25,380
iteration of the loop, we need to check

12

00:00:25,380  -->  00:00:29,160
if the enemy's hit points are 0, or our hit points are

13

00:00:29,160  -->  00:00:31,890
zero, and if they are we need to print

14

00:00:31,890  -->  00:00:33,360
out that the battle is over, essentially.

15

00:00:33,360  -->  00:00:42,750
So, if enemy get HP equals 0, going to

16

00:00:42,750  -->  00:00:46,800
print out bcolors

17

00:00:46,800  -->  00:01:00,600
green, it's going to be green, you win, and we need to end

18

00:01:00,600  -->  00:01:06,510
the color there. We need to set running

19

00:01:06,510  -->  00:01:08,850
to false.

20

00:01:08,850  -->  00:01:17,970
If player HP equals 0,

21

00:01:17,970  -->  00:01:19,380
we're going to print out basically that

22

00:01:19,380  -->  00:01:23,040
you lost. So we're going to print that

23

00:01:23,040  -->  00:01:37,290
out in fail, enemy has defeated you. There we

24

00:01:37,290  -->  00:01:41,579
go and in that color as well, and we're

25

00:01:41,579  -->  00:01:45,899
also going to set running equal = false.

26

00:01:45,899  -->  00:01:48,210
Now what we get as you can imagine if we

27

00:01:48,210  -->  00:01:50,100
run the script we are allowed to attack,

28

00:01:50,100  -->  00:01:52,140
and they attack us, so we're just going

29

00:01:52,140  -->  00:01:55,680
to keep going, and at some point enemy

30

00:01:55,680  -->  00:01:59,100
has defeated us, that's very unfortunate.

31

00:01:59,100  -->  00:02:02,040
Now, what we can do to actually defeat

32

00:02:02,040  -->  00:02:04,530
the enemy is adding some more options like the

33

00:02:04,530  -->  00:02:06,899
ability to heal and use magic, and the

34

00:02:06,899  -->  00:02:09,399
magic is going to do a bit more damage

35

00:02:09,399  -->  00:02:11,769
then our attack. Let's make it do more

36

00:02:11,769  -->  00:02:20,980
damage actually. So, what I'm going to do is up here going to

37

00:02:20,980  -->  00:02:23,980
add a 1. Let's make that

38

00:02:23,980  -->  00:02:33,189
100, 100 and 124. So, now we need a

39

00:02:33,189  -->  00:02:39,849
way to choose the magic, and this is

40

00:02:39,849  -->  00:02:41,440
going to come down to in this if

41

00:02:41,440  -->  00:02:44,530
statement if index is 0 obviously we want

42

00:02:44,530  -->  00:02:46,900
to attack,

43

00:02:46,900  -->  00:02:50,560
if lf index equals one we're going to be

44

00:02:50,560  -->  00:02:52,030
using magic.

45

00:02:52,030  -->  00:02:54,790
So what we need to do is basically just

46

00:02:54,790  -->  00:02:56,709
allow the player to choose magic and

47

00:02:56,709  -->  00:02:58,689
then generate the spell damage and then

48

00:02:58,689  -->  00:03:02,319
attack the enemy, and that's basically

49

00:03:02,319  -->  00:03:04,720
going to take the same flow as here. So,

50

00:03:04,720  -->  00:03:10,569
magic damage is going to be equal to player generate

51

00:03:10,569  -->  00:03:15,459
spell damage for, we haven't even

52

00:03:15,459  -->  00:03:19,750
chosen the magic yet. So, let's go ahead

53

00:03:19,750  -->  00:03:26,109
and player choose magic, and then we need

54

00:03:26,109  -->  00:03:32,109
to capture their input so magic choice

55

00:03:32,109  -->  00:03:35,440
will be equal to input.

56

00:03:35,440  -->  00:03:38,470
Actually, let's do it this way.

57

00:03:38,470  -->  00:03:48,519
Ok, so, choose magic.

58

00:03:48,519  -->  00:03:52,629
However, what we're going to do is we're

59

00:03:52,629  -->  00:03:54,549
not going to do the same thing we did up

60

00:03:54,549  -->  00:03:56,379
here where we separated it into two

61

00:03:56,379  -->  00:03:58,479
variables to be able to reduce the

62

00:03:58,479  -->  00:04:01,269
number of the input by one, what we're

63

00:04:01,269  -->  00:04:02,470
going to do is we're going to do that

64

00:04:02,470  -->  00:04:04,750
all in one line. So how we're going to do

65

00:04:04,750  -->  00:04:07,659
that is we're going to wrap the input in

66

00:04:07,659  -->  00:04:10,329
int right off the bat and then reduce it

67

00:04:10,329  -->  00:04:15,530
by one, so we can pass that right through.

68

00:04:15,530  -->  00:04:21,200
So this is going to generate the spell

69

00:04:21,200  -->  00:04:23,240
damage and as you can see what it's

70

00:04:23,240  -->  00:04:24,980
going to do we're passing in the number,

71

00:04:24,980  -->  00:04:28,220
it's going to get that index of the list

72

00:04:28,220  -->  00:04:30,919
of magic, and it's gonna get the damage

73

00:04:30,919  -->  00:04:33,200
then you know choose a random between

74

00:04:33,200  -->  00:04:34,880
magic lower magic and high which is going to

75

00:04:34,880  -->  00:04:37,700
be -+ 5.

76

00:04:37,700  -->  00:04:41,330
So, after we've generated the spell

77

00:04:41,330  -->  00:04:45,860
damage we need to also reduce the magic

78

00:04:45,860  -->  00:04:51,620
points by the cost of that spell. So, I'm

79

00:04:51,620  -->  00:04:59,240
gonna set spell equal to player get

80

00:04:59,240  -->  00:05:06,290
spell name, my magic choice, and then also

81

00:05:06,290  -->  00:05:11,210
the cost is going to be player get spell

82

00:05:11,210  -->  00:05:15,500
and np cost. I'm also going to pass in magic

83

00:05:15,500  -->  00:05:19,040
choice so that we can get basically each

84

00:05:19,040  -->  00:05:21,440
thing we need from the spell right here,

85

00:05:21,440  -->  00:05:26,270
and then we're going to get the current

86

00:05:26,270  -->  00:05:41,539
magic points of the player. So, get MP. So,

87

00:05:41,539  -->  00:05:44,030
if we have enough magic points we want

88

00:05:44,030  -->  00:05:46,910
to successfully cast the spell, otherwise we

89

00:05:46,910  -->  00:05:50,030
want to say you can't do this.

90

00:05:50,030  -->  00:05:56,630
So, what we're going to do is if cost is

91

00:05:56,630  -->  00:06:05,930
more than the current MP, we need to

92

00:06:05,930  -->  00:06:08,240
basically say you don't have enough MP.

93

00:06:08,240  -->  00:06:18,140
So, print out bcolors, fail, we're

94

00:06:18,140  -->  00:06:22,220
going to skip a line say

95

00:06:22,220  -->  00:06:31,100
not enough MP, then bcolors, end color.

96

00:06:31,100  -->  00:06:34,310
Now what we need to do at this point is

97

00:06:34,310  -->  00:06:37,760
we need to skip back to the beginning,

98

00:06:37,760  -->  00:06:39,290
well actually for right now

99

00:06:39,290  -->  00:06:43,340
they're just going to miss their turn, so

100

00:06:43,340  -->  00:06:54,620
otherwise they're actually going to we

101

00:06:54,620  -->  00:06:56,780
need a way to restart that. We will come

102

00:06:56,780  -->  00:06:59,360
back to this in the next video. What

103

00:06:59,360  -->  00:07:00,380
we're going to do right now is we're

104

00:07:00,380  -->  00:07:02,330
just going to continue along and we're

105

00:07:02,330  -->  00:07:04,520
going to reduce the MP cost if they're

106

00:07:04,520  -->  00:07:09,830
able to, so player reduce MP and it's

107

00:07:09,830  -->  00:07:14,750
going to reduce it by cost. Then we're

108

00:07:14,750  -->  00:07:19,370
going to generate the magic damage. It's

109

00:07:19,370  -->  00:07:21,110
going to be equal to...

110

00:07:21,110  -->  00:07:28,400
we've already generated the spell damage

111

00:07:28,400  -->  00:07:32,270
damage right there. Okay, cool. So we

112

00:07:32,270  -->  00:07:34,370
don't need to generate that here,

113

00:07:34,370  -->  00:07:37,490
got a little mixed up there. What

114

00:07:37,490  -->  00:07:39,890
we're going to do is we're going to tell

115

00:07:39,890  -->  00:07:44,840
the enemy to take the damage, and the

116

00:07:44,840  -->  00:07:47,120
damage that they're going to take is the

117

00:07:47,120  -->  00:07:52,700
magic damage. Then we're going to print

118

00:07:52,700  -->  00:07:55,970
out that the magic spell deals x amount of

119

00:07:55,970  -->  00:07:59,419
damage. So, print and for this we're going

120

00:07:59,419  -->  00:08:07,130
to be using the okay blue color. So, let's

121

00:08:07,130  -->  00:08:21,280
print out a line break, spell name, deals

122

00:08:21,280  -->  00:08:25,600
going to use a comma here, convert this

123

00:08:25,600  -->  00:08:32,830
to a string, magic damage, another comma,

124

00:08:32,830  -->  00:08:41,349
points of damage. Then we're going to end

125

00:08:41,349  -->  00:08:52,330
that and we need to then print out the

126

00:08:52,330  -->  00:09:01,450
enemies current hit points. Actually, let's

127

00:09:01,450  -->  00:09:06,640
at the end of the statement we're going

128

00:09:06,640  -->  00:09:09,310
to print out everybody's hit points just to

129

00:09:09,310  -->  00:09:11,050
make it a bit cleaner here,

130

00:09:11,050  -->  00:09:13,839
so where is player hit points as well.

131

00:09:13,839  -->  00:09:19,120
Alright, so down here we're actually going to

132

00:09:19,120  -->  00:09:22,510
go ahead and print out the hit points,

133

00:09:22,510  -->  00:09:24,970
your magic points, and the enemy hit points. So,

134

00:09:24,970  -->  00:09:30,190
in order to separate that from the rest

135

00:09:30,190  -->  00:09:31,480
of the turn

136

00:09:31,480  -->  00:09:33,160
we're going to put a single line here.

137

00:09:33,160  -->  00:09:45,700
Enemy's hit points are three colors

138

00:09:45,700  -->  00:09:55,200
let's make that fail so it's red,

139

00:09:55,200  -->  00:10:02,040
HP I'm going to put a slash here so the current HP

140

00:10:02,040  -->  00:10:13,710
out of enemy get max HP, and then we

141

00:10:13,710  -->  00:10:27,780
need to end the color. So and we're also

142

00:10:27,780  -->  00:10:29,790
going to do a line break there because

143

00:10:29,790  -->  00:10:30,930
we're going to print out your

144

00:10:30,930  -->  00:10:39,030
information next. So, print your hit points

145

00:10:39,030  -->  00:10:43,290
equal to bcolors,

146

00:10:43,290  -->  00:10:53,340
ok green so just convert to a string, player

147

00:10:53,340  -->  00:11:06,120
get HP out of player get max HP, and then

148

00:11:06,120  -->  00:11:12,750
we're going to end that color. And then

149

00:11:12,750  -->  00:11:13,890
you need to print out your magic points

150

00:11:13,890  -->  00:11:16,260
because we have begun to use magic now

151

00:11:16,260  -->  00:11:18,210
and so your magic points are going to

152

00:11:18,210  -->  00:11:19,710
reduce, and it's helpful to know what

153

00:11:19,710  -->  00:11:27,090
your magic points are. So, your MP is

154

00:11:27,090  -->  00:11:29,580
going to be equal to bcolors,

155

00:11:29,580  -->  00:11:34,770
okay blue, convert this to a string player

156

00:11:34,770  -->  00:11:47,790
get MP out of

157

00:11:47,790  -->  00:11:55,200
get max MP, and then we're going

158

00:11:55,200  -->  00:12:00,330
to end that as well and then skip a line

159

00:12:00,330  -->  00:12:04,470
because we're all done here. So, we did a

160

00:12:04,470  -->  00:12:07,230
lot here so let's go ahead and run this

161

00:12:07,230  -->  00:12:08,820
and see what happens.

162

00:12:08,820  -->  00:12:14,340
So we can choose to attack and we get a

163

00:12:14,340  -->  00:12:19,740
problem there because we did not add the

164

00:12:19,740  -->  00:12:22,770
parentheses after the get HP I think

165

00:12:22,770  -->  00:12:24,120
that's the only problem there, let's start

166

00:12:24,120  -->  00:12:27,000
again. So we have attacked and as you can

167

00:12:27,000  -->  00:12:30,150
see now we actually have the actions

168

00:12:30,150  -->  00:12:33,870
being printed out, and then the stats

169

00:12:33,870  -->  00:12:35,760
being printed out, and then the next term

170

00:12:35,760  -->  00:12:36,240
again.

171

00:12:36,240  -->  00:12:39,090
So if we continue doing that let's

172

00:12:39,090  -->  00:12:43,230
choose magic. So now if we choose magic

173

00:12:43,230  -->  00:12:46,470
let's go ahead and choose thunder. As you

174

00:12:46,470  -->  00:12:48,000
can see thunder deals a 120

175

00:12:48,000  -->  00:12:49,380
points of damage

176

00:12:49,380  -->  00:12:51,930
so now things are looking a bit better.

177

00:12:51,930  -->  00:12:54,540
We can then go ahead and choose thunder again,

178

00:12:54,540  -->  00:13:01,260
we've got 41 magic points, some fire, there we go.

179

00:13:01,260  -->  00:13:03,210
We're definitely going to lose

180

00:13:03,210  -->  00:13:11,820
still, although we're striking for a lot

181

00:13:11,820  -->  00:13:13,590
more damage right now than the enemy is.

182

00:13:13,590  -->  00:13:16,410
If I had not started at...I don't have

183

00:13:16,410  -->  00:13:25,200
enough MP. Oh, yeah, that works. Okay, hold on

184

00:13:25,200  -->  00:13:27,540
look up here. So basically what

185

00:13:27,540  -->  00:13:31,650
happens is if you don't have enough

186

00:13:31,650  -->  00:13:33,600
magic points by putting continue here, I

187

00:13:33,600  -->  00:13:36,330
totally missed this, by putting continue

188

00:13:36,330  -->  00:13:38,520
here it we don't miss the turn the enemy

189

00:13:38,520  -->  00:13:40,380
doesn't attack us and stuff because it

190

00:13:40,380  -->  00:13:41,730
just skips back to the next iteration

191

00:13:41,730  -->  00:13:44,010
which allows us to choose our action

192

00:13:44,010  -->  00:13:45,240
against so we can then choose attack

193

00:13:45,240  -->  00:13:49,020
instead of magic.

194

00:13:49,020  -->  00:13:50,520
Let's go ahead and lose this battle,

195

00:13:50,520  -->  00:13:53,970
enemy has defeated us, and the problem

196

00:13:53,970  -->  00:13:56,160
here is that we don't have a way to heal.

197

00:13:56,160  -->  00:13:58,620
And so what we need to do, we're going to

198

00:13:58,620  -->  00:13:59,080
be doing

199

00:13:59,080  -->  00:14:00,790
the next video, but we're going to add a

200

00:14:00,790  -->  00:14:06,720
way to heal.
