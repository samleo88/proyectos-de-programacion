00:00.330 --> 00:07.080
And the first property we're going to look at the one that affects only the Flex items or children is

00:07.080 --> 00:09.030
going to be an older property.

00:09.330 --> 00:15.990
And by default all children are going to have or property with a value of zero.

00:15.990 --> 00:17.400
Now what does that mean.

00:17.490 --> 00:19.170
We have five items correct.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.070
And all of them have the order of zero.

00:22.080 --> 00:28.660
And since we know that in fact we can start manipulating our items without changing the HMO because

00:28.680 --> 00:34.380
obviously you could place let's say the item number two on the front if you just move it here within

00:34.380 --> 00:42.860
the HMO or what we're gonna do is in fact we're gonna make our changes only in the CSF so our operational

00:42.900 --> 00:45.760
structure is going to stay the same.

00:46.290 --> 00:48.140
Let's start with Box Number 1.

00:48.180 --> 00:55.300
Let's imagine the scenario where all like the move box number one all the way at the end of my line.

00:55.580 --> 01:01.380
Now the way we can do that is in fact setting a box number one some targeting box number one and I'm

01:01.380 --> 01:07.060
going to use my order property and knowing that the rest of the boxes have order 0 0.

01:07.080 --> 01:12.120
Well what we could do is I could set up order being 1.

01:12.150 --> 01:18.000
Now this case what happens is that number 2 has 0 3 0 4 0 5 0.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.410
However this guy the box number one as the order of 1.

01:22.650 --> 01:26.540
And now since this order is in fact bigger than 0.

01:26.710 --> 01:30.620
And that's the reason why this box is sitting all the way at the end.

01:30.660 --> 01:37.200
Now since we know that both of them or I'm sorry all of them are by default 0 less than 1.

01:37.200 --> 01:37.740
Of course not.

01:37.740 --> 01:38.990
We changed our No.

01:39.060 --> 01:46.100
Well I could do the same thing only move box number five all the way to the beginning of my line.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.610
Now the way I do that is in fact go less than zero.

01:49.620 --> 01:52.640
So remember all of them are zero by default.

01:52.920 --> 02:00.340
So if I'm gonna set up as negative 1 as you notice my box is in fact moving to a beginning of the line.

02:00.360 --> 02:07.200
And again keep in mind we're not touching on each team no more racially in our structure stays exactly

02:07.200 --> 02:07.940
the same.

02:07.980 --> 02:11.160
We're making our changes only see SS now.

02:11.250 --> 02:18.540
I also like to show that the same is going to work if we're going to go with Lux direction and we're

02:18.540 --> 02:24.750
going to set it for column and doesn't change the fact again five is number one even though it shouldn't

02:24.750 --> 02:25.090
be.

02:25.230 --> 02:33.270
No reason why because the order is less than zero and then sends box number one as bigger than zero.

02:33.270 --> 02:36.150
Or that's the reason why is all the way at the end.

02:36.180 --> 02:44.100
Now if I'm gonna change let's say or the box number 1 to 2 and let's say I would want to place box number

02:44.100 --> 02:45.740
2 in between.

02:45.810 --> 02:49.610
So I want to place it in between 4 and 1.

02:49.620 --> 02:51.120
How I would do that.

02:51.280 --> 02:59.040
Well very simply not just set up box number two and let's go with order now needs to be bigger 0 and

02:59.040 --> 03:00.570
less than 2.

03:00.630 --> 03:03.060
And of course the answer is 1.

03:03.140 --> 03:09.840
So that way again we're just changing the order of our content just by using our SS.
