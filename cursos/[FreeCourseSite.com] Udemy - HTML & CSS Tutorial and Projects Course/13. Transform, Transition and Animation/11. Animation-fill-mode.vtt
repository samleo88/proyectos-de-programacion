00:00.520 --> 00:05.740
While we're still on a topic of animation why don't we take a look at the animation film on property

00:06.070 --> 00:15.160
and what it stands now the theory is that animation film mode is helpful with defining the values outside

00:15.160 --> 00:16.360
the animation.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.060
Now in practical how this is gonna look like.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.740
Well I don't know maybe an index each demo.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.670
Let's get her of this transition we don't need it as well as LET'S MAKE OUR SUCCESS A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:27.670 --> 00:33.400
Slim where we're not gonna have these styles for transitions because we already have covered it.

00:33.550 --> 00:38.170
And you know what also I would like to get rid of all these comments here and you know what might as

00:38.170 --> 00:44.290
well let's get her of the animation for now at least and delete all the information that we had within

00:44.290 --> 00:49.250
the move animation to begin with just I would like to start from scratch.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.320
So I have my animation and you know what the moment I save it.

00:52.340 --> 00:53.520
Obviously this is gonna be my day.

00:54.290 --> 00:59.770
And let's imagine some kind of scenario where there's gonna be an animation and I would want to start

00:59.770 --> 01:05.540
with the opacity of zero which would mean that we wouldn't be able to see this live and we're gonna

01:05.560 --> 01:09.400
do the animation where it goes back to zero point five percent.

01:09.580 --> 01:15.830
So then we would want to decide how the animation film mode is going to come into play.

01:15.880 --> 01:22.880
First things first let's set up our animation and I'm gonna say that at 0 percent there is gonna be

01:22.970 --> 01:27.930
the opacity of zero right opacity zero.

01:28.070 --> 01:32.240
Then also there's going to be 50 percent animation so at all you know what.

01:32.540 --> 01:34.970
Let's maybe write 25 percent.

01:34.970 --> 01:38.600
At 25 we would like to transform property again.

01:38.600 --> 01:45.110
And there's gonna be translate X negative 200 or not 200 let's do 200.

01:45.140 --> 01:51.580
This is gonna shift to the right as well as let's add a little bit more opacity in this case opacity

01:51.640 --> 02:00.580
is gonna be I don't know zero point twenty five since this is 25 percent then let's copy and paste it.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.860
So let's say 1 2 we have 50 percent.

02:03.860 --> 02:04.040
Yeah.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.630
That should be enough.

02:05.630 --> 02:13.860
So with 50 percent we're gonna have the capacity of zero point five then at hundred percent.

02:14.120 --> 02:19.110
We're also going to have a opacity of let's say you know what.

02:19.110 --> 02:23.480
No let's change it around let's say 50 percent there's gonna be opacity 1.

02:23.660 --> 02:29.960
And then once we go back 200 percent we're gonna have a capacity of zero point five.

02:30.530 --> 02:33.300
We already know how we can use the animation.

02:33.370 --> 02:37.340
So the right animation and the name is gonna be what.

02:37.340 --> 02:38.870
Well the name was move.

02:38.990 --> 02:40.540
So that would be a first value.

02:40.730 --> 02:44.040
Then we're looking for how long the duration would be.

02:44.060 --> 02:47.960
So let's say five seconds and let's run this two times.

02:47.970 --> 02:51.270
Now the moment we save it our innovation is kicking in.

02:51.290 --> 02:52.820
Everything is working fine.

02:52.820 --> 02:54.140
But what happened.

02:54.770 --> 02:59.980
Well we get to the 50 percent and this is where we're gonna stop then.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.060
And here obviously there's a mistake.

03:02.090 --> 03:02.460
Sorry.

03:02.570 --> 03:07.560
I'm looking at I'm thinking why this is doing that because I was a little left the translate with two

03:07.570 --> 03:09.320
hundred so let me fix this.

03:09.350 --> 03:12.230
I would want to have not two hundred so my bad.

03:12.230 --> 03:15.630
I was waiting waiting for it and I'm like looking at it well wait a minute.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.420
Nothing is really happening.

03:17.420 --> 03:20.140
And then let's say zero.

03:20.150 --> 03:25.640
So this is gonna bounce to the right then bounce left back and then end up with zero.

03:25.780 --> 03:26.650
In the moment we save it.

03:26.660 --> 03:30.110
Now we have our information when it bounces first time bounces.

03:30.110 --> 03:39.020
The second time and then the end of the second time it stays back to a capacity of one because we can

03:39.020 --> 03:44.060
clearly see where the actual devastating sitting for and maybe that's not something we would want.

03:44.090 --> 03:47.260
Maybe I would want to end up with opacity of zero point five.

03:47.510 --> 03:53.570
So this is where the property of animation film mode comes into play where we can head over back here

03:53.600 --> 03:59.960
and we can see animation and film mode and we have few options we have backwards where this would go

03:59.960 --> 04:05.200
back to original value which in our case would be something like this where we have an option of.

04:05.480 --> 04:11.390
Now how the forwards is gonna look like the moment I'm going to save it eventually once the animation

04:11.390 --> 04:15.650
is gonna stop running my device is going to stay with opacity of zero point five.

04:15.840 --> 04:16.750
Don't believe me.

04:16.790 --> 04:20.180
Let's test it out the animation runs the first time.

04:20.280 --> 04:21.920
Okay so far so good.

04:21.920 --> 04:26.240
Then again we run the animation the second time and the moment it stops running.

04:26.390 --> 04:34.550
Instead of going back to opacity one which would be our original value we are going forwards and staying

04:34.550 --> 04:36.670
with whatever values we had here.

04:36.680 --> 04:43.190
So if I'm going to add let's say translation of 20 pixels what's gonna happen is my div is gonna be

04:43.190 --> 04:44.760
by default right now.

04:44.780 --> 04:50.300
Also translated not only of passive and in general terms this is how we can work with animation film

04:50.300 --> 04:56.870
mode where you would want your day of let's say to get the values that you end up with with hundred

04:56.870 --> 05:02.120
percent then yours is gonna add animation film mode and you're going to use the value of forward.
