WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:02.630
Okay we know what we're going to build.

00:02.640 --> 00:08.430
Why don't we get busy doing that and we'll start off by creating general project setup which by the

00:08.430 --> 00:10.830
way you're gonna do for most of your projects anyway.

00:11.550 --> 00:18.190
But before we get too carried away let me give you an A brief explanation of why I chose to use CSX

00:18.270 --> 00:21.130
floats for our layout instead of legs box.

00:21.150 --> 00:21.980
Great.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.230
Now first and foremost it's very simple.

00:24.330 --> 00:30.480
We haven't covered flex box or agreed yet so it only makes sense that we're using only the tools that

00:30.480 --> 00:33.000
we have talked about during our tutorial.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.340
Second as you're progressing in what development you'll still see a bunch of code using as well.

00:39.870 --> 00:45.230
And it only makes sense that you would have at least general understanding how floats work.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.690
Are you going to use floats once you learn about legs box Ingrid.

00:49.020 --> 00:50.110
Probably not.

00:50.340 --> 00:56.700
But to have at least basic knowledge of floats we're only going to benefit you as a side note if you

00:56.700 --> 01:01.630
don't want to bother roll this video and fall along how we're setting up the folder structure.

01:01.800 --> 01:06.920
You can just get the set of files and then when I say folder structure meaning we're going to get images

01:06.920 --> 01:11.220
the font awesome custom fonts as well as general CSO setup.

01:11.400 --> 01:17.040
Again if you want to skip that just go to the resource of this video and you're going to get the set

01:17.040 --> 01:20.970
of files which are going to include exactly everything that we're doing.

01:20.970 --> 01:24.990
So first things first we would need to start with a folder structure.

01:24.990 --> 01:25.980
Now what does that mean.

01:25.980 --> 01:32.490
Well I am on my desktop and I can just say that there is going to be new folder and let's say and rename

01:32.490 --> 01:36.180
this I'm going to rename this T station.

01:36.300 --> 01:41.340
This is going to be my beautiful product or product project name.

01:41.610 --> 01:42.620
So far so good.

01:42.630 --> 01:43.530
What else we're having.

01:43.530 --> 01:48.120
Well we need a text that are right and we're gonna say there's going to be a text that are gonna open

01:48.120 --> 01:54.180
up my text that are then we're going to set up our first indexation email so let's write indexation

01:54.210 --> 01:58.590
the email let's get our basic structure with our Emmett.

01:58.590 --> 02:04.710
Brief suggestion and now that I have this now basically once I have the next session email why don't

02:04.710 --> 02:06.450
we open up in the browser.

02:06.450 --> 02:11.190
So here I'm gonna say that I would like to open up the browser and that again we can use all kinds of

02:11.190 --> 02:12.390
option for this.

02:12.390 --> 02:17.740
And basically what we are doing is we are using right now the visual studio called Live preview.

02:17.760 --> 02:22.260
Now I'm going to set them side by side so I'm going to say that there is gonna be side by side.

02:22.260 --> 02:27.990
My project as well as my little side browser window where we can see everything that we're going to

02:27.990 --> 02:30.120
be doing throughout the project.

02:30.120 --> 02:36.920
And here let me write first of all title and let's write the station and I'm gonna write recording.

02:36.930 --> 02:40.700
Now you don't have to do that but I would like to play side by side.

02:40.740 --> 02:43.990
My final project which is the one that we're recording right now.

02:44.100 --> 02:46.060
So I might as well distinguish them somehow.

02:46.470 --> 02:49.800
MARGARET So we have all this good one else we're having.

02:49.830 --> 02:55.220
Well I'm going and like I said open up the new browser window and here I'm gonna say one twenty seven

02:55.470 --> 03:00.150
so I know this is gonna be where my project and you know it by the way just so we can see that we actually

03:00.150 --> 03:01.370
have the project.

03:01.470 --> 03:07.640
Let me write some think one with basic low world where I know that.

03:07.720 --> 03:11.130
Okay so this is gonna be my project NOW FOR NOW.

03:11.130 --> 03:16.710
YOU KNOW WHAT I WILL gonna zoom this out meaning I'm gonna have the full browser window and now let

03:16.710 --> 03:18.170
me look for my project.

03:18.180 --> 03:22.500
So here I believe the name was changed the amount and something T station.

03:22.500 --> 03:27.750
So this is gonna be our final project and I'm gonna set this on the left hand side so as we're working

03:27.750 --> 03:32.970
we're gonna be able to see the bigger browser window off our the project that we're currently working

03:33.390 --> 03:34.880
as well as the finish line.

03:34.950 --> 03:37.230
So that way I can always explain hey listen guys.

03:37.230 --> 03:42.300
So now we're gonna be working this section then we're going to move onto that section and so on and

03:42.300 --> 03:43.130
so forth.

03:43.140 --> 03:47.280
Now let me head over back to my desktop and let's see what we're gonna have.

03:47.280 --> 03:52.020
Well I talked about the set of files so if you want to skip all this chatter that I'm doing right now

03:52.470 --> 03:56.340
just head over to the set of files and then we have the folder structure.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.770
Well do we have the complete folder structure.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.210
I don't think we do at the moment.

04:00.210 --> 04:06.390
So let me open up the right now the folder and first let me create some kind of I don't know folder

04:06.780 --> 04:13.800
that I can name either images or AMG where you guessed that already we're going to be keeping our images.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.420
So I'm gonna say who are here images the long one and then we might as well go get the images.

04:20.430 --> 04:21.500
I don't see why not.

04:21.510 --> 04:26.270
Because since we already have the folder we can right away go and look for images.

04:26.460 --> 04:29.480
Now for the images there's gonna be few options that we can use again.

04:29.490 --> 04:33.140
There is grab Instagram feed their pixels nearest pixel Bay.

04:33.180 --> 04:34.620
I'm gonna go with pixels.

04:34.740 --> 04:38.050
You can again choose whatever option suits your needs.

04:38.050 --> 04:40.880
And let me go to our good old friend Google.

04:41.030 --> 04:45.730
I'm gonna save pixels and within the pixels all I did was royalty.

04:45.760 --> 04:49.590
Now this is gonna be the case where I'm going to be checking what kind of images I had.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.360
So I believe I had this guy.

04:51.360 --> 04:54.290
So let me head over back and let me find the image.

04:54.870 --> 04:57.300
So I believe this is this one.

04:57.350 --> 04:59.650
And let me save image now.

04:59.760 --> 05:06.600
The naming is technically not important but in the sense that if I'm gonna be referring to my files

05:06.660 --> 05:11.940
some kind of name you just need to remember that if you named your files differently then obviously

05:12.240 --> 05:16.050
this is gonna be the case where you need to follow the your own syntax.

05:16.050 --> 05:20.220
And I believe my when I called about BCG or you know what.

05:20.220 --> 05:20.590
No.

05:20.670 --> 05:22.560
My apologies it was main BCG.

05:22.950 --> 05:25.020
So this was the main background.

05:25.020 --> 05:29.690
And this is how I'm saving this then I'm gonna see the other one.

05:29.790 --> 05:30.360
What I had.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.200
So let me check the other image.

05:32.250 --> 05:33.360
This was the about one.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.120
So I'm looking for this kettle.

05:35.140 --> 05:36.780
Hopefully I'm gonna be able to find it.

05:37.230 --> 05:44.940
So the kettle was here and we're gonna say save him in jars then we're gonna have here about BCG so

05:45.000 --> 05:49.090
this was the involved BCG and then I had three for the product.

05:49.170 --> 05:52.740
So this one was here the second one on the third one.

05:52.740 --> 05:57.990
Now let me head over again back to the pixels and this is going to be the tricky one I believe that

05:57.990 --> 06:04.470
one of them must pressure this guy so I can right away save him in jars and then I can write product

06:04.530 --> 06:09.780
let's say one or two it doesn't really matter I just named them product one two three.

06:09.780 --> 06:15.160
That was my naming but I don't think it really matters which one you're actually placing there.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.220
So I believe this guy was the number one.

06:17.280 --> 06:22.010
Yeah I believe so it's a as well we would like to save this.

06:22.110 --> 06:26.500
So in this case this is going to be already product number two and you already see that I'm making a

06:26.500 --> 06:30.440
mistake right now my my mistake is that I'm not saving this thing in images.

06:30.450 --> 06:31.910
So that is not correct.

06:31.920 --> 06:32.840
So let me fix this.

06:32.850 --> 06:33.630
Let me say that.

06:33.630 --> 06:35.720
Product number two is gonna be in images.

06:36.060 --> 06:41.310
And what I would like to do right now is head over back to my folder structure and grab all these images

06:41.310 --> 06:42.780
that I have right now.

06:42.780 --> 06:48.030
Copy and paste it or saved it on my machine and I'm gonna get rid of them.

06:48.120 --> 06:53.610
So I would like to say that I can either copy them or we can just move them into the images because

06:53.610 --> 06:57.380
that was obviously the whole point why we had the file to begin with.

06:57.390 --> 07:02.940
Now what else we can do well I can head over back to the actual file and get rid of them.

07:03.080 --> 07:03.930
Can say you know what.

07:03.930 --> 07:09.340
I don't need them right now on my project route I need them in my image responder.

07:09.490 --> 07:11.960
Now there's going to be one more thing that we're gonna do with the cropping.

07:11.970 --> 07:17.540
But before we do that let me just get the last image and I think it's gonna be really pain because I

07:17.550 --> 07:19.710
already forgot which one was which.

07:19.710 --> 07:20.670
So let me double check.

07:20.670 --> 07:21.660
So this was this guy.

07:21.660 --> 07:23.820
So cattle with a flower.

07:23.820 --> 07:31.700
And if you see it please scream so that I can hear that if I scrolled maybe two down too much.

07:31.950 --> 07:34.430
Keep on scrolling oh there it is.

07:34.440 --> 07:35.950
There is an image.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.050
So let me say product number three.

07:38.250 --> 07:42.970
And I'm wondering why none of you help me as I said please scream once you see the image.

07:43.650 --> 07:44.480
I don't he.

07:44.570 --> 07:48.050
I didn't hear anybody screaming so I am very disappointed in you.

07:48.490 --> 07:50.950
OK so this is gonna be our image number three.

07:51.030 --> 07:57.420
Now what I did is again I use the quick and dirty way where I used Mac for help.

07:57.420 --> 08:03.180
So I selected all three images then we can do open with and just because I would want them all to be

08:03.180 --> 08:06.610
the same size and I know that this is a little bit annoying.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.870
So let me just grab this one.

08:09.180 --> 08:10.690
This is not what I would want.

08:10.710 --> 08:11.720
Thank you for using.

08:11.730 --> 08:12.910
Well yeah okay.

08:12.930 --> 08:14.460
So that's all good.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.380
I don't want to rate you.

08:16.380 --> 08:18.650
Let me move this guy a little bit smaller.

08:18.930 --> 08:24.080
Again my apologies then I would like to select them all and once I have all the images then we're going

08:24.080 --> 08:31.380
to do adjust the size and I went again kind of brutal way where I just went 800 by 600.

08:31.380 --> 08:37.440
As always you can use obviously Photoshop for days but since I don't want to get into all this right

08:37.440 --> 08:43.050
now I would like to use this quick and dirty way where we're just using the Mac for that and for now

08:43.060 --> 08:45.790
we would have all our images the same way.

08:45.990 --> 08:51.690
I think that should cover the images and again let me get my little notebook where it tells me what

08:51.690 --> 08:52.160
we're doing.

08:52.170 --> 08:57.700
So we have a set of files we had some kind of folder structure we did talk about it now there's going

08:57.700 --> 09:02.010
to be more things to it but for now this is going to be good and then we're looking for the font awesome

09:02.010 --> 09:07.520
icons the nice icons that we can add to our project there's going to be two ways that we can do it.

09:07.570 --> 09:13.140
Well first of all we need to go to their web page and remember we had an option of let's say starting

09:13.140 --> 09:16.650
using free and you can just use the CDM.

09:16.740 --> 09:20.430
However I don't know where in future you are watching this.

09:20.940 --> 09:27.030
So if the version has changed if the version is not anymore it's 5.2 or whatever.

09:27.060 --> 09:31.870
Well most importantly if it's something like six I believe they're not going to change manually if you're

09:31.890 --> 09:37.590
watching let's say five point nine but if you're already watching six that means that they have maybe

09:37.650 --> 09:39.150
made some adjustments to it.

09:39.690 --> 09:44.010
So if you're watching this in a future which obviously you will and I think you're going to be watching

09:44.010 --> 09:45.040
this in the past.

09:45.270 --> 09:52.040
But if the version has changed then you do need to get the same folder where I'm gonna have my fantasy

09:52.040 --> 09:55.570
I'm downloaded and actually using local in our project.

09:55.590 --> 10:00.680
So that's something to remember if the version is somewhat similar obviously you can just copy and paste

10:00.680 --> 10:06.200
the CDM and then we'll have to head over back to our document and somewhere here we're going to have

10:06.430 --> 10:07.650
obviously the CDM.

10:08.020 --> 10:13.740
Now maybe let's do right after title let's say font awesome answer.

10:14.040 --> 10:18.690
Let's say this is gonna be whatever the CDM that you would need to copy and you know what.

10:18.790 --> 10:22.150
Right after this maybe let's write custom.

10:22.480 --> 10:27.930
Because this is where our CSI style is gonna live more as our city assess file.

10:28.030 --> 10:30.840
Sorry not style but file okay.

10:31.240 --> 10:37.330
If you are watching this in future why don't we go over also how I'm going to be done on this in the

10:37.330 --> 10:38.190
first place.

10:38.290 --> 10:42.670
So let's say I'm going to be looking for the download then remember within download there right away

10:42.690 --> 10:45.310
told us that there's many options we can choose.

10:45.310 --> 10:49.770
Well I'm going to be choosing this one and for this I would need them on this first and then I'm gonna

10:49.780 --> 10:51.670
head over to my downloads.

10:51.670 --> 10:55.800
Hopefully there are gonna be empty so there's not going to be a bunch of files and actually this state

10:55.810 --> 10:57.680
from already tutorial already.

10:57.730 --> 11:02.650
So what I can do is I can just open up again the new one just so you can see that it's there and what

11:02.650 --> 11:05.560
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna drag and drop the file.

11:05.650 --> 11:10.870
I could have just drag and drop it right away maybe into the folder that would have made a little bit

11:10.870 --> 11:14.210
more sense and then we're looking for is all synapses.

11:14.410 --> 11:17.700
Now it is important that you drag and drop the folder.

11:17.740 --> 11:22.150
This is exactly what they're saying because if you're just gonna drag and drop the one file that you

11:22.150 --> 11:29.410
would need let's say all say it says it's not going to work people know okay Phantasm how are we gonna

11:29.410 --> 11:30.500
get phantasm.

11:30.550 --> 11:34.960
We know we can use the link tag and within the line tag we just need to specify this.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.480
So I'm looking for the folder name.

11:36.550 --> 11:42.300
And again as a side note if you rename this folder anything different then you need to look for that

11:42.310 --> 11:42.990
folder.

11:43.180 --> 11:48.010
Please don't rename this orange and then be upset that if you're looking for Phantasm you're not able

11:48.010 --> 11:49.020
to find it.

11:49.130 --> 11:52.630
Then we have this useless folder then within the instance folder.

11:52.640 --> 11:53.390
Damn.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.570
Drumroll please.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.530
We do have our phantasm.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.860
Well maybe I got too carried away already.

11:58.870 --> 12:00.520
Maybe let me double check.

12:00.610 --> 12:05.470
Remember the syntax was the tag and then I'm gonna use the immature kids right now where I'm going to

12:05.470 --> 12:13.720
say a face halfway home my probably most favorite one and let's write F.A. AND almost 6 x just so we

12:13.720 --> 12:20.530
have the massive font awesome image and now I can do the drumroll because we do have the phantasm so

12:20.530 --> 12:26.400
we have covered successfully that I can right away may be right and we close it as well as pixels with

12:26.400 --> 12:27.560
only pixels.

12:27.720 --> 12:31.850
And let me go again back to my sticky note and let's see what I have next.

12:31.900 --> 12:34.310
I have found awesome icons awesome.

12:34.330 --> 12:40.720
We covered that and then we have custom font custom ones we're going to use Google funds for the now

12:40.720 --> 12:44.470
let me look for first of all Google fonts.

12:44.710 --> 12:47.440
And here I'm gonna be obviously going to the gold funds.

12:47.650 --> 12:55.810
And again right away I can apologize if my spelling is not awesome or maybe not spelling sorry pronunciation

12:56.400 --> 13:02.490
because I'm gonna be looking for I believe it pronounced cut to my round again I might be wrong.

13:02.500 --> 13:06.730
You can laugh all day long but that's unfortunately how I pronounce it.

13:06.790 --> 13:08.680
So let me read this card.

13:08.930 --> 13:11.940
My round and we're getting basically this one.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.780
So this is gonna be my phone that I'm looking for.

13:14.770 --> 13:18.090
However with this point I would like to customize it a little bit.

13:18.310 --> 13:22.950
So there's going to be a regular one and there's gonna be the bold one let's say 700.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.900
That's gonna be my option.

13:24.910 --> 13:32.230
Also I'd like to look for one more so I can minimize this guy and instead of cut down Maran I'm purposely

13:32.390 --> 13:34.710
not pronouncing if I'm saying this wrong.

13:34.840 --> 13:40.190
Hopefully this doesn't make you laugh because believe it or not it does make me laugh.

13:40.600 --> 13:46.570
Grand Hotel is gonna be my second one which you already can tell we're gonna be using as our styling

13:46.570 --> 13:47.280
option.

13:47.380 --> 13:52.840
So if you would want some text to send out we're gonna use this grand hotel and what we have right now

13:52.840 --> 13:53.760
is gonna be two of them.

13:54.280 --> 13:58.240
If I'm gonna head over again to embedding you'll notice that I have two of them.

13:58.510 --> 13:59.410
So you know what.

13:59.410 --> 14:00.880
No I won't.

14:00.880 --> 14:06.140
My apologies I didn't have the font so I keep on talking as if I would have to funds but I don't know

14:06.140 --> 14:11.290
the load time is gonna be moderate and yes I agree that probably is not something you're looking for

14:11.320 --> 14:17.210
but for a first project really I don't think we need to worry about it too much.

14:17.350 --> 14:22.240
So let's say we have two options again we can import it in the CSX or we can just have it as a link

14:22.720 --> 14:29.080
again to have it as a link just copy and paste it here within your I don't know let's say right after

14:29.080 --> 14:29.850
phantasm.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.900
Now just switch things around.

14:31.900 --> 14:36.380
I'm going to do import and we're gonna be importing this in our CSX.

14:36.430 --> 14:37.480
Now the question is.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.210
Well you don't have to CSX.

14:39.810 --> 14:41.050
Yeah that's true.

14:41.050 --> 14:49.190
But don't we know how to make the CSX file a new file and the name is gonna be against Stiles CSX.

14:49.250 --> 14:55.990
As always you can name this whatever your heart desires but you do need to link it because we can write

14:55.990 --> 14:57.460
here whatever you'd like.

14:57.520 --> 15:02.920
It is not going to work my friends because if we haven't linked it so I'm going to say links or I'm

15:02.920 --> 15:09.370
linking this right now it's late then I'm looking for the Stiles the name of your file don't mix and

15:09.370 --> 15:15.280
match them if you named as something weird also link this to something we're OK.

15:15.850 --> 15:19.720
We have all this covered so now within the styles I would like to copy and paste it.

15:19.780 --> 15:23.150
These are going to be my files or I'm sorry my fonts.

15:23.350 --> 15:26.560
We have successfully imported them so far so good.

15:26.590 --> 15:27.280
What else we have.

15:27.310 --> 15:34.150
Well then we have these font family but before we work hard on the font families and adding them why

15:34.150 --> 15:40.630
don't we also do the general CSA setup like when the variables and reset which we will gonna reuse all

15:40.630 --> 15:44.260
throughout the project now how this is gonna work.

15:45.840 --> 15:46.350
Let's see.

15:46.350 --> 15:48.270
So first of all I would like to do the reset.

15:48.360 --> 15:53.820
Remember we had those default padding the margins and I would just like to get it in now quick and dirty

15:53.820 --> 15:58.280
where it would be something like this where we are selecting all the elements.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.080
I'm gonna say all the elements.

16:00.270 --> 16:02.330
I don't know why I'm choosing the max with that.

16:02.430 --> 16:04.000
That is not what I want.

16:04.050 --> 16:09.710
I wanted margin margins in the zero padding is gonna be you guessed it zero.

16:09.930 --> 16:16.000
And then whoever knows the answer for this guy can watch the next videos for free.

16:16.230 --> 16:22.140
Which by the way you're watching anyway because you have only one cause but obviously that was my lame

16:22.140 --> 16:27.800
attempt on being sarcastic but we're looking for box sizing which is gonna be equal to the border.

16:27.810 --> 16:35.160
But again just to recap the reason why we're using this border box because as we having let's say some

16:35.160 --> 16:42.450
kind of padding or border we wouldn't want our device or our elements or boxes to expand would want

16:42.450 --> 16:48.780
to set some kind of width and then the changes should be applied to the box itself not by making the

16:48.780 --> 16:49.820
box bigger.

16:49.960 --> 16:52.680
Then we also know that we can use the CSA as wearables.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.570
Remember those guys and where I would want to use them.

16:55.720 --> 17:01.350
Well I think I'm going to my I might be wrong but I think I would want to use them all throughout the

17:01.350 --> 17:02.130
project.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.300
What was the way for doing that.

17:03.750 --> 17:04.830
Well we had a route.

17:04.830 --> 17:09.330
We had this selector not just random selector by the way.

17:09.330 --> 17:16.410
This was our pseudo selector and now I'm selecting my email and within this nation email element I would

17:16.410 --> 17:18.460
like to set up my variables here.

17:18.510 --> 17:22.830
This is where the colors are going to come in and you know what I have to apologize I messed up a little

17:22.830 --> 17:26.760
bit on my sticky note as well as you know what I'm gonna add a new one.

17:26.760 --> 17:34.350
So I'm going to say general setup is gonna have colors my apologies I did mess that one up.

17:34.350 --> 17:38.880
Let me make this bigger so just so you can see it a little bit better.

17:39.030 --> 17:40.920
Now let me make this one may be smaller.

17:40.920 --> 17:46.380
And now we have colors so successfully we also have a color because I didn't cover the color.

17:46.380 --> 17:53.170
However may be our first thing should be dealing with the funds because right now we have to find families

17:53.170 --> 17:54.060
that we need to include.

17:54.070 --> 17:56.770
And I kind of keep on ignoring them.

17:56.770 --> 17:57.960
So why don't we do this.

17:57.970 --> 18:03.640
Why don't we first of all within the route create our first variable where we're gonna call this slanted

18:03.640 --> 18:05.020
text.

18:05.020 --> 18:08.330
As always you can name this whatever you like.

18:08.350 --> 18:10.480
This is just gonna be holding your value.

18:10.660 --> 18:15.370
And if somebody gets annoyed by the fact that I'm going to say as always you can name this where you're

18:15.370 --> 18:15.720
like.

18:16.510 --> 18:21.040
I know but I kind of need to repeat this because so people don't think that there's some kind of secret

18:21.040 --> 18:26.610
syntax that you need to use because these two dashes might look overwhelming and a beginning.

18:26.620 --> 18:27.800
I do agree with that.

18:27.850 --> 18:29.230
You're like looking you're liking.

18:29.260 --> 18:33.480
Okay there's two dashes there's probably this name has to do something with a text.

18:33.490 --> 18:33.890
Well no.

18:33.910 --> 18:36.460
This is just a container that's holding your value.

18:36.580 --> 18:39.250
So don't get too hung up on this.

18:39.340 --> 18:42.700
I just called a slanted text because the text is gonna be slanted.

18:42.700 --> 18:43.890
I could have called this.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.050
Johnny is great.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.920
It will work exactly the same way.

18:47.140 --> 18:47.960
Slide the text.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.880
And now I'd like to use my font family remember.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.990
And in this case I'm gonna be using this grand called.

18:55.070 --> 19:01.260
So let me grab this guy and let's say that this slanted text is gonna be equal to this one family.

19:01.270 --> 19:07.110
Now I copy and pasted everything and that is not correct because I only need the value here.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.910
So my slanted text is going to hold this value.

19:10.090 --> 19:14.810
Then every time I like to use the font family for this not next I'm just gonna grab this.

19:15.020 --> 19:20.230
And that would be number one just to finish with the font so we're done with them and we don't need

19:20.230 --> 19:21.820
to carry about them.

19:21.830 --> 19:24.100
Let's do body and for the whole body.

19:24.100 --> 19:26.530
This is where I wouldn't want to use the other one.

19:26.530 --> 19:34.740
The famous catamaran and yeah I purposely didn't like a Russian version just so it sounds even funnier.

19:34.990 --> 19:38.680
But our catamaran right now is in our project.

19:38.680 --> 19:39.670
So that is all good.

19:39.670 --> 19:42.010
So that would be the basic setup for all our phones.

19:42.160 --> 19:46.300
And then whenever we would like to use them let's say slanted ones we can use this guy.

19:46.300 --> 19:50.500
Now maybe just to test it out just to prove that actually I do make sense.

19:50.500 --> 19:55.300
We have the herring one and why don't we over go here and we will gonna delete this of course.

19:55.300 --> 20:00.960
But let's say for all the heading ones the fun family is gonna be you guessed it drum.

20:01.120 --> 20:04.470
We have the variable not the variable is gonna be slanted text.

20:04.540 --> 20:11.020
Now you can write the long way var this word that and then parentheses or with Visual Studio code you

20:11.020 --> 20:17.710
have a very very nifty setup where just two dashes and then you're looking for your whatever variables

20:17.970 --> 20:24.040
not at the moment we have one GA but later on we're going to multiples on this is this would be a little

20:24.040 --> 20:24.960
bit easier setup.

20:25.240 --> 20:28.240
Now I'm getting my slant indexed and booyah.

20:28.300 --> 20:33.430
We have our heading one that has right now the font family of this grand hotel.

20:33.820 --> 20:38.320
So every time we're gonna use it or I'm sorry every time we're gonna need it we're just gonna grab those

20:38.320 --> 20:39.860
values longer.

20:39.910 --> 20:41.370
What I also would like to add here.

20:42.220 --> 20:44.790
Let's do maybe a line height for the body.

20:45.340 --> 20:49.990
Let's do the full so the whole text throughout the whole document is gonna have some kind of line height

20:50.500 --> 20:52.330
which is gonna be one point five.

20:52.510 --> 20:53.940
Again nothing really specific.

20:53.940 --> 20:56.720
This is very general that you always see.

20:56.740 --> 21:01.150
And then if you want to change the line height and you just add different kind of number and so on and

21:01.150 --> 21:02.370
so forth.

21:02.410 --> 21:04.340
Let me say this you this.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.140
Let me get rid of the font.

21:06.220 --> 21:08.330
I do believe we cover them.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.500
I do believe everything has been covered.

21:10.660 --> 21:16.150
And now let's go over the colors because I'm gonna add some colors again in the road just so we can

21:16.150 --> 21:17.560
access them later.

21:17.690 --> 21:19.910
I'm not going to be looking for these colors right now.

21:19.920 --> 21:24.310
We're going to show you again that we can use the coolers and then within the coolers you can start

21:24.310 --> 21:28.900
your generator and then you can just keep on slamming on the spacebar.

21:28.900 --> 21:30.920
And this is gonna give you the options.

21:31.030 --> 21:35.200
Now this is in general way how you can get the colors and actually you know what this is.

21:35.200 --> 21:38.410
This actually looks very very nice color theme.

21:38.410 --> 21:43.330
So just in case you're wondering yeah you can just pause the video and get these colors because I do

21:43.330 --> 21:44.470
find them real good.

21:44.500 --> 21:48.780
The green one really goes with the gray one and the blue one is also awesome.

21:48.790 --> 21:53.530
Again I I really digress a little bit but this actually came out really good.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.430
Now I'm not going to be using these colors.

21:55.450 --> 21:56.880
I already have the setup colors.

21:56.890 --> 22:01.740
So in the style see assessment and look for wrote and within the rules.

22:01.740 --> 22:03.240
Let's just name our callers.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.400
We can name this differently.

22:05.400 --> 22:10.290
The reason why I'm naming this primary let's say color is the simple fact that even though we're all

22:10.290 --> 22:16.380
gonna be using the green color for this project maybe later on I change it to blue let's say now is

22:16.380 --> 22:21.360
it gonna be big deal if I'm named this let's say Maine green color and then change it.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.630
No no probably not.

22:23.640 --> 22:27.430
But it would help if you will just have some kind of primary color.

22:27.490 --> 22:30.240
Then if you change in the blue it's not confusing to you.

22:30.270 --> 22:33.920
Maybe later on as well as if somebody else is working on a project.

22:34.230 --> 22:36.480
Again this is really a preference.

22:36.640 --> 22:41.480
You'll see a lot where people are using primary colors secondary color but you can name them.

22:41.480 --> 22:45.660
I would say with the white ones I just named the main white and my da because there's always gonna be

22:45.660 --> 22:48.110
some kind of main white and mean darker.

22:48.510 --> 22:50.400
Like I said this is gonna be green.

22:50.400 --> 22:56.150
And now we will gonna type them unless you are actually downloading the set of files of course.

22:56.370 --> 23:03.480
6 9 8 f 3 F and the good news is that this is gonna be the only time we have to type them like this

23:04.020 --> 23:07.700
because the moment I'm gonna start working on the project which is a primary color.

23:07.710 --> 23:08.740
That's it.

23:08.790 --> 23:13.430
Imagine how annoying this would be if I would have to use it like 50 times with hashtag.

23:13.500 --> 23:16.010
6 9 8 f 3 F.

23:16.220 --> 23:22.860
Granted the visual studio code gives you a nice setup so later on you can already do a quick switch

23:22.860 --> 23:24.110
where you're just getting this rather.

23:24.570 --> 23:29.620
But I still think that primary color would be easier to remember than we have the second record that

23:29.630 --> 23:34.290
dairy colors can vary color and we're gonna use this literally in one place.

23:34.290 --> 23:34.850
I believe.

23:34.890 --> 23:43.270
I'm not wrong and this is gonna be the yellow one so f see a 3 1 1 people.

23:43.290 --> 23:48.840
So that's gonna be our yellow one and then we have the like I said mine dark mane dark.

23:48.840 --> 23:51.170
So that would be kind of a black ish one.

23:51.240 --> 23:55.970
So let's say 3 a re e.

23:56.510 --> 24:00.260
And then we have three be very very original name.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.980
So three a three three B and now what.

24:03.980 --> 24:05.960
You know this is not really mean dark.

24:05.960 --> 24:06.800
This is.

24:06.800 --> 24:07.010
Yeah.

24:07.040 --> 24:10.660
Well it kind of is it's kind of dark ish greenish or whatever you call it.

24:11.140 --> 24:13.690
And then I would also have the main White now the main White.

24:13.700 --> 24:15.960
Just gonna be kind of straightforward.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.400
We're gonna say man white and hashtag f.

24:19.850 --> 24:26.950
That's gonna be our main white color as well as I would like to have some men grey one main grey and

24:26.960 --> 24:34.880
let's set it up with hashtag e five E five E five while we're still on a subject on the variables.

24:34.880 --> 24:40.550
Why don't we set up the transition a letter spacing and I kind of understand it's a lot for this video.

24:40.550 --> 24:44.000
You might be like Hey listen you know this set of video and all that.

24:44.060 --> 24:44.450
Yeah.

24:44.480 --> 24:48.170
But once we're done with the setup this is gonna be a smooth sailing.

24:48.170 --> 24:49.830
If we already set up everything.

24:50.230 --> 24:54.200
And I think this is gonna be much more faster going to say main transition.

24:54.200 --> 25:01.350
Again this is gonna be just my variable name and how we did we work with transitions.

25:01.610 --> 25:03.280
What was the general setup.

25:03.440 --> 25:05.230
Remember we had the properties.

25:05.230 --> 25:07.110
So in my case I'm just gonna say all of them.

25:07.290 --> 25:12.260
So on the properties and then I'm going to be looking for some kind of timing and the key here is very

25:12.260 --> 25:12.960
simple.

25:13.070 --> 25:18.020
I'm gonna say Here zero point three and all throughout the document we're all gonna be using our transitions

25:18.410 --> 25:23.750
we will going to use the zero point three if we would like to change something else we can just come

25:23.750 --> 25:28.880
here and change the value and that way we're going to access it all throughout the document or we can

25:28.880 --> 25:34.100
rewrite the new transition but let's say if we're using transition and like I don't know six places

25:35.190 --> 25:40.020
I do find it much more easier if we just set it up in one place you know variables you technically don't

25:40.020 --> 25:44.700
have to do it but I'd just like to do it that way and then let's write Easy in and out.

25:44.700 --> 25:49.290
Remember this was by default ease you can maybe write linear.

25:49.290 --> 25:52.690
This could also probably work but I'm just gonna go with ease in and out.

25:53.100 --> 25:59.280
And last but not least as far as our variables are concerned are gonna be letter and then we're looking

25:59.280 --> 26:04.560
for spacing and again this is just my naming and four letter spacing remember we had some kind of values

26:04.950 --> 26:10.350
in my case I would like to use zero point five grams and now we set up the letter spacing for the whole

26:10.350 --> 26:11.020
document.

26:11.130 --> 26:17.270
Now we're not using honestly this value right now but this should generally help us out whenever we

26:17.270 --> 26:21.440
are working with any kind of document to set up these variables.

26:21.480 --> 26:26.640
Now the moment I'm gonna start using the variables I will gonna head over back here I will gonna cover

26:26.640 --> 26:32.760
again what we did and why we did and maybe that might be annoying for somebody but in my case I think

26:32.760 --> 26:37.770
that kind of solidifies the knowledge that we had but in general this would be our shut up and now we

26:37.770 --> 26:39.150
can start working on our project.
