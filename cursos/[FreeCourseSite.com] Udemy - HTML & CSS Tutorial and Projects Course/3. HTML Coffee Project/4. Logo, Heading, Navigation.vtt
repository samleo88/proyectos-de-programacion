Once we have our images we can start working on a project and actually start doing some kind of HDMI.

00:06.690 --> 00:10.800
Now as you can see we need to start by getting the logo first.

00:10.890 --> 00:15.360
Then we're gonna have the heading three and then we're gonna have our little board.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.640
Now this is the first thing that I would like to do.

00:17.800 --> 00:22.790
And then we're gonna start moving on and working with different sections of the project.

00:22.900 --> 00:27.360
Now first of all I would like to get an image obviously where we know that we would need to use the

00:27.360 --> 00:27.810
image there.

00:28.380 --> 00:33.960
So here within the body and I just start getting the image and for the image we're going to be looking

00:33.960 --> 00:36.210
for the source or our slate with new.

00:36.210 --> 00:40.740
Also I meant right away that we're going to give us the source and within the source now we would need

00:40.740 --> 00:42.850
to navigate to the images folder.

00:42.870 --> 00:47.790
Now we know that we would need to use the relative past and maybe I didn't mentioned this before but

00:47.790 --> 00:50.310
you also going to see a lot of times this duck.

00:50.490 --> 00:57.240
So again this that would mean the same thing where we are navigating somewhere within the folder meaning

00:57.330 --> 01:01.050
the index right now and the images are still within the same folder.

01:01.500 --> 01:05.420
However the image that we're looking for is in the images folder.

01:05.460 --> 01:10.670
So first we would need to navigate still within this folder and look for the images folder.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.880
Once we get the images folder what's going to be next.

01:14.310 --> 01:16.320
Well then we're gonna be looking for the logo right.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.090
So as you can see right now we're getting the logo.

01:19.190 --> 01:20.810
Now let's just right here.

01:20.850 --> 01:23.550
Coffee coffee.

01:23.550 --> 01:24.810
Logo.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.290
Yeah.

01:25.290 --> 01:26.600
Now we have our image.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.010
So this is all good.

01:28.020 --> 01:34.800
Next what we have after the image we have some kind of heading on my case I used I believe heading three

01:35.400 --> 01:41.780
so I'm gonna say heading three and we're just gonna call this the this is gonna be the name of the company

01:41.780 --> 01:44.760
your website or whatever you would like to make it.

01:44.790 --> 01:47.340
And in this case I'm gonna say coffee junkie.

01:47.470 --> 01:53.610
And next we would need to create our now but not for the nav bar I said that we would be using on our

01:53.610 --> 01:59.490
list of first we would need to create another list then for every list item we know that we need to

01:59.670 --> 02:05.340
create a list item element and then within the last night of women this is where we are creating our

02:05.340 --> 02:09.270
legs now for every link we're gonna have to have the atrium.

02:09.320 --> 02:14.970
So basically the path or the direction where this link is gonna be go and on since we're gonna start

02:14.970 --> 02:19.620
with the homepage and say that the homepage is gonna be going to indexation email.

02:19.680 --> 02:23.760
Now obviously we haven't created yet the rest of the pages.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.110
However it doesn't stop us from creating these links.

02:27.120 --> 02:32.520
So what I would like to do right now is just copy and paste this three times and instead of having this

02:32.610 --> 02:37.460
as a whole I'm going to change it to about numbers and contact.

02:37.470 --> 02:43.570
So first of all let me again do multiple cursors so we know that we would need to use all product.

02:43.570 --> 02:49.600
So in this case if I'm gonna press on multiple places notice I'm gonna be having multiple quarters.

02:49.710 --> 02:54.840
So let me delete first of all home because each and every one of them is going to be different as well

02:54.840 --> 02:57.440
as to let's get rid of all the indexes at the same time.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.710
So just like that we got rid of all the indexes and let's say the second page is gonna be about each

03:03.720 --> 03:09.330
normal and a name in our nav bar is going to be about.

03:09.420 --> 03:10.410
Now let me say this.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.330
Let's see.

03:11.400 --> 03:17.890
Sure enough we have the bolt and then let's have the numbers numbers change the amount this is going

03:17.890 --> 03:21.890
to be our page and in the number we have numbers.

03:21.890 --> 03:29.200
Now last but not least we're looking for contact measured the amount and this will be equal in the number

03:29.280 --> 03:31.440
to contact and just contact.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.980
We're not going to add anything else.

03:33.140 --> 03:33.700
Good.

03:33.710 --> 03:40.400
We added logo we added heading three as well as our number and maybe just to double check we can go

03:40.460 --> 03:43.770
to the bigger browser window and let's see how this is gonna look.

03:43.820 --> 03:49.280
I think it looks good enough and we already move on to start working the next part of our project.
