00:00.210 --> 00:00.990
Beautiful.

00:00.990 --> 00:05.340
Once we have our setup let's start with general naming conventions.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.690
So each and every time we're gonna work with flux box we're gonna have two things a parent container

00:12.930 --> 00:18.930
referred to as a flex container and children referred as flex items.

00:18.930 --> 00:23.100
Now keep in mind in our case we have five children correct.

00:23.100 --> 00:28.780
We have five boxes but the same would work even if we would have only one child.

00:28.980 --> 00:31.660
Also a parent and children can be any age.

00:31.660 --> 00:34.380
The amount elements as long as it makes sense.

00:34.410 --> 00:38.400
So please don't try to put divs within the button.

00:38.610 --> 00:42.690
Now once we got that out of the way how we can start working with the flex box.

00:42.870 --> 00:45.290
Well it's essentially quite easy.

00:45.300 --> 00:51.960
So again I'm gonna head over to a style but of course we could have done it within the CNS within the

00:51.960 --> 00:59.050
style C assess and I'm gonna have to select a parent container or a flex container.

00:59.070 --> 01:02.160
Now what is the class for my flex container.

01:02.160 --> 01:06.410
Oh I believe it is a container container like so.

01:06.590 --> 01:08.310
And then we have a display property.

01:08.850 --> 01:15.580
So display property and now the value is going to be either flex or in conflicts.

01:15.710 --> 01:21.080
And then the second I'm going to show you the differences but let's go with the flex and you'll notice

01:21.090 --> 01:25.130
that right away my boxes are stacked side by side.

01:25.140 --> 01:27.490
Now I wanted to let you know right away.

01:27.580 --> 01:32.400
There's multiple properties with multiple values that come by default.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.320
That's the reason why we right away see this kind of layout.

01:35.640 --> 01:40.170
And of course we're gonna cover those properties and we're gonna take a look at those defaults.

01:40.530 --> 01:45.080
But please understand that it is not just this property that makes it happen.

01:45.090 --> 01:51.030
However the moment we type it like I said behind the scenes there are some properties with some defaults

01:51.030 --> 01:55.340
already and that's the reason why we have this current layout right away.

01:55.460 --> 02:01.470
Now like I said we also had an option of inline flex so just for your reference I'm going to keep this

02:01.730 --> 02:07.320
and I'm just gonna come in to sell it and then let's write again and display and in this case we're

02:07.320 --> 02:11.880
gonna go for display property and let's write in line flex.

02:11.890 --> 02:18.660
Now the difference between these two is as you see in the browser while the flex is in fact a block

02:18.750 --> 02:23.970
level element where it's spanning all across the page and I think it's going to be a little bit easier

02:23.970 --> 02:29.070
to take a look at that in the browser where we're taking a look at the bigger browser window.

02:29.520 --> 02:32.520
So let me open up a new browser window.

02:32.660 --> 02:37.150
Let's head over actually to believe it was 80 80.

02:37.170 --> 02:38.310
Something like that.

02:38.310 --> 02:46.650
And notice this is in line flex when in fact it is a inline element so it takes up only the space that

02:46.680 --> 02:48.480
in fact the boxes have.

02:48.480 --> 02:52.620
So if the boxes would be bigger then of course we would take up a bigger space.

02:52.630 --> 03:00.360
However as far as the block level element the one that is flex while it takes up the whole screen size.

03:00.450 --> 03:05.490
So depending on the screen size it is going to be spanning all across just like a normal block level

03:05.490 --> 03:06.100
element.

03:06.240 --> 03:09.380
So those would be the differences now with our examples.

03:09.390 --> 03:13.450
We're just going to focus on the flex so the block level one.

03:13.470 --> 03:19.350
But please keep in mind that you also have an option of working with the inline element and then the

03:19.350 --> 03:22.950
property is going to have a value of inline flex.
