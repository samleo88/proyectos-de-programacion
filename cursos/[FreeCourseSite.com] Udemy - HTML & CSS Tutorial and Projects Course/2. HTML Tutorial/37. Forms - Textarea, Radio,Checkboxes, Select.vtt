WEBVTT

00:00.590 --> 00:04.770
Input elements are not the only thing that we can display within the form.

00:04.820 --> 00:07.280
So let's look at the other popular ones.

00:07.400 --> 00:12.500
Now with your permission I'm just gonna continue working with the same file again if you'd like to access

00:12.500 --> 00:14.640
the resources of the previous video.

00:14.750 --> 00:21.470
You can just download resources for the previous video but after the email input we're just gonna look

00:21.470 --> 00:24.280
at the few other more popular ones.

00:24.410 --> 00:30.170
Now the first one is gonna be text area where we can have some longer description and you can already

00:30.170 --> 00:35.780
see that right away as we start typing with them and this gives us few attributes that we haven't seen

00:35.780 --> 00:36.540
before.

00:36.650 --> 00:40.690
Now first one would be columns and the second one is gonna be there.

00:41.330 --> 00:44.570
So let's say we would like to have some kind of description.

00:44.570 --> 00:45.650
Check this out.

00:45.680 --> 00:51.190
So again this is not gonna be styled very nicely right now because we have everything all over the place.

00:51.410 --> 00:56.120
But let's say that if you would like to have some kind of line break in between them.

00:56.120 --> 01:02.120
Again just for styling for now we all gonna have our description let's say here and maybe we can just

01:02.120 --> 01:09.310
add the paragraph of the description and we can accurately write our description within our text editor

01:10.150 --> 01:15.900
and columns would mean how many columns of I'm going to say 40 I'm going to have 40 columns if I'm going

01:15.900 --> 01:20.760
to say 20 I'm going to have 20 columns and the same thing would go for.

01:20.900 --> 01:25.220
Now also we have the radio buttons and for the radio buttons.

01:25.220 --> 01:30.890
What's unique is that you can have only one value meaning you can submit one value.

01:30.920 --> 01:36.920
That's the whole point of the radio but now you don't have to specifically do it that way but that would

01:36.920 --> 01:39.910
make sense since are obviously we're designed for that.

01:40.270 --> 01:44.260
And again let me add another line break just so it's gonna be displayed there.

01:44.420 --> 01:58.230
And let's say that we're gonna have a paragraph which ask Louise please like select your favorite coding

01:58.950 --> 02:02.790
language so hopefully this is written correctly.

02:02.790 --> 02:08.650
Once we have our paragraph read and for us what is your most favorite coding language.

02:08.690 --> 02:13.590
Also maybe add a question mark gonna make a little bit more sense and then we are going to be working

02:13.590 --> 02:19.890
with the input type of radio so we can use the semicolon or we can just create a basic one and change

02:19.890 --> 02:19.980
it.

02:20.530 --> 02:25.710
So I'm gonna use the right away I'm at and here I'm gonna have the name and I.D. Now I'm not going to

02:25.710 --> 02:31.090
need any of them for now meaning I will gonna use later on name but for now I'm not going to use it.

02:31.130 --> 02:33.570
Let's just write that this is gonna be javascript.

02:33.830 --> 02:38.760
So once I'm gonna save it notice I'm gonna have my radio button and there's gonna be some kind of value.

02:39.390 --> 02:46.740
Now the thing is with the radio buttons the names should match because the whole idea behind radio button

02:46.740 --> 02:52.410
is the fact is that you would just choose one of them later on you will gonna have select boxes where

02:52.410 --> 02:59.420
we can pick multiple but if you would like to use the radio button the name of the input should match.

02:59.470 --> 03:03.310
Now how this is going to look first of all let me copy and paste this.

03:03.330 --> 03:08.340
So let's say there's gonna be three of them and let's write the second one is gonna be Java language

03:08.790 --> 03:14.780
and the third one we're gonna have as Python python.

03:14.940 --> 03:21.000
Now the moment I'm gonna save this I'm gonna have an option of choosing one over here because again

03:21.000 --> 03:24.490
the idea was would be that if I am selecting something.

03:24.840 --> 03:30.720
Now you also would want as you're submitting it as some kind of value because you not only would want

03:30.720 --> 03:34.300
to click on the radio button you would like to collect the value.

03:34.670 --> 03:38.150
So in our case we're gonna hard code that this is gonna be javascript.

03:38.190 --> 03:44.630
Now as the value has to match to whatever you would like to submit if you would like to submit some

03:44.630 --> 03:48.130
kind of John Doe obviously you would need to write it in the value John Doe.

03:48.560 --> 03:52.620
So in our case for Java we're gonna write all your Java.

03:52.730 --> 03:55.920
This is gonna be my value as well as for the python.

03:56.020 --> 03:59.900
I'm going to copy and paste it and here we're gonna write Python.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.840
I hope you understand the whole purpose of this.

04:02.950 --> 04:09.170
Since you would want to submit this kind of data whether this is gonna be a javascript language or Java

04:09.170 --> 04:14.510
language and radio button is gonna allow you to choose which one you're submitting.

04:14.510 --> 04:20.720
However the value is gonna be the one that's passed on whenever we're adding this information to the

04:20.720 --> 04:21.520
data.

04:21.550 --> 04:24.300
This is just showing what the user is picking.

04:24.350 --> 04:29.840
So again in our case we're not using the actual value for now but is obviously important to use it later

04:29.840 --> 04:32.530
on as you actually submitting the data.

04:32.570 --> 04:38.450
Now if you mess up here with this name remember the name attribute all of them need to match.

04:38.450 --> 04:42.530
Because if I'm gonna do like this if I'm going to say that let's say the second one is gonna be not

04:42.530 --> 04:46.280
coding it's gonna be called in and if we're gonna save it.

04:46.340 --> 04:52.010
Now the trick here is that I can pick javascript and I can pick Java and this is not something we would

04:52.010 --> 04:57.380
want with radio button because the whole idea is to use checkboxes for that.

04:57.770 --> 04:58.280
Okay.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.950
So your next question probably is.

04:59.980 --> 05:03.710
Well what is checkbox is then how do we start using it.

05:03.860 --> 05:09.380
Well again we're gonna do the same old deal where we have first of all probably some kind of Lindberg

05:10.450 --> 05:11.140
in between.

05:11.150 --> 05:17.060
So we can see a little bit better and let's say again before we submit and right after the radio button

05:17.700 --> 05:21.740
that's and the airline break and we'll gonna have to again have the input.

05:21.860 --> 05:24.560
Now in this case this is gonna be checkbox.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.890
So again we're not looking for radio or this is gonna be the checkbox.

05:27.890 --> 05:33.410
And you know what right away also let's add the paragraph and let's write out the same old deal that

05:33.410 --> 05:34.750
we had before.

05:34.760 --> 05:40.700
So with your permission I'm just gonna copy paste this just so we save a little bit of time as well

05:40.700 --> 05:47.180
as you notice we have the type of checkbox and now again we have the same old deal where we have the

05:47.180 --> 05:48.970
name as well as the value.

05:49.820 --> 05:53.250
So what do you think what a value what we would like to write.

05:53.300 --> 05:54.850
I think we can do the same thing right.

05:54.860 --> 05:59.600
So we have the value first of all is gonna be javascript that's gonna be the first thing that's gonna

05:59.600 --> 06:04.180
be passed on as well as we would need to write the actual javascript here.

06:04.250 --> 06:05.210
So I'm going to say you know what.

06:05.240 --> 06:05.520
Okay.

06:05.540 --> 06:07.280
So this is gonna be javascript.

06:07.310 --> 06:13.360
Now the difference with actual checkboxes here is that we can pick multiple.

06:13.760 --> 06:17.380
So let's say we're gonna change first of all the name to programming.

06:17.510 --> 06:23.880
Again this is gonna be our name programming and let me make sure that I read this correctly.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.440
And now it's copy and paste this.

06:26.060 --> 06:28.380
Let's say one two three.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.400
And you know what I did.

06:29.430 --> 06:30.180
One too many.

06:30.780 --> 06:37.410
So let's first of all change whatever value we have because I was so we don't want to JavaScript or

06:37.410 --> 06:42.240
3 JavaScript in our case we would want only to meeting.

06:42.300 --> 06:43.980
Sorry we would want only one.

06:44.250 --> 06:47.210
And let's change the second one to Java.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.910
Is also gonna be value of Java.

06:50.460 --> 06:52.590
Value of Python.

06:52.590 --> 06:57.540
And again I know I'm repeating this but the values we're gonna use only when we're submitting data.

06:57.690 --> 07:04.580
Now you could write whatever you would like order and let's write Python on right over here and what

07:04.600 --> 07:10.470
we have here is the checkbox is all with checkbox checkboxes we can click multiple so we can choose

07:10.470 --> 07:14.530
let's say that our favorite languages are gonna be all three of them.

07:14.550 --> 07:20.350
So that would be the biggest difference between checkboxes and the radio buttons.

07:20.380 --> 07:25.960
The simple fact that with trademarks is we can click multiple look and choose multiple but we have the

07:25.960 --> 07:26.650
radio buttons.

07:26.650 --> 07:29.100
The whole idea is that you're just choosing one.

07:29.830 --> 07:30.210
OK.

07:30.220 --> 07:36.490
So we also have an option of select so select would be something like a drop down menu or something

07:36.490 --> 07:36.880
like that.

07:37.360 --> 07:43.600
So again same old deal right after the python let's create maybe in this case again a paragraph and

07:43.600 --> 07:45.760
the paragraph is gonna same old deal.

07:45.760 --> 07:51.610
We're gonna ask the same old question because again I don't see the point of being really creative during

07:51.610 --> 07:57.820
the editorial right now because the most important thing is to understand the general concept and for

07:57.820 --> 07:58.900
the select box.

07:59.110 --> 08:04.240
This would be different where again we create an element and the element is gonna be select.

08:04.240 --> 08:08.580
And here we need to write let's say what kind of name it would be.

08:08.590 --> 08:15.920
Now we're going to write again languages which is how we can just leave the idea for now empty.

08:15.940 --> 08:16.360
You know what.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.060
You know what.

08:17.080 --> 08:22.390
One last thing that I wanted to show you with checkboxes we also have an option of check.

08:22.900 --> 08:30.060
So if we have checked already the checkbox let's say by default we can add an attribute.

08:30.070 --> 08:36.550
So for this I'm gonna add our back to let's say my first one and we have the attribute of checked and

08:36.550 --> 08:39.560
we can just leave it like this or we can set it equal to check.

08:39.810 --> 08:41.730
It's gonna work exactly the same way.

08:41.800 --> 08:42.290
So I notice.

08:42.310 --> 08:47.640
Now once they have the check for JavaScript the javascript is gonna be automatically checked.

08:47.680 --> 08:52.660
Now I can still on track it but by default is gonna be checked since we added this attribute and we

08:52.660 --> 08:58.030
can add this attribute to all of them if you want and sometimes you're gonna see the long way written

08:58.150 --> 09:05.380
not the HD email where we're gonna be looking for check is going to be to check again this would mean

09:05.380 --> 09:09.130
exactly the same thing as just having a check like this.

09:09.790 --> 09:18.490
So let's get rid of this and now let's finish off we can select now within the select we have options.

09:18.490 --> 09:24.400
Those would be something similar like you have with all the Nord list Remora you had the list items.

09:24.490 --> 09:31.000
So the same deal would work with select where within the select there is an option element now within

09:31.000 --> 09:31.840
the option element.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.030
Again we're working with the values.

09:34.030 --> 09:36.790
So we're saying okay what is the value here.

09:36.880 --> 09:42.850
Again we're gonna start with a javascript javascript which again will be submitted.

09:42.870 --> 09:48.070
I know I've said this many times but I just think that it's important to kind of get this point across

09:48.070 --> 09:50.540
where the value is gonna be shown.

09:50.890 --> 09:55.900
So the text is gonna be shown within the amount but the value is gonna be something that's going to

09:55.900 --> 09:57.000
be submitted.

09:57.010 --> 09:59.740
Now again we have few other options.

09:59.740 --> 10:01.160
So let me you know what.

10:01.170 --> 10:06.210
Maybe let me make this a little bit smaller on the right hand side.

10:06.220 --> 10:12.370
So then we can see better and if we copy and paste this multiple times and again we're gonna do the

10:12.370 --> 10:21.900
same deal where we have Java where we have also Python python and we also would like to change these

10:21.900 --> 10:22.880
values.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.000
So let's say Java.

10:25.380 --> 10:29.950
And last one but not least we have the python.

10:30.450 --> 10:33.120
So this would be a drop down menu now and you know what.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.440
Maybe not.

10:34.530 --> 10:40.350
And a little bit more might break and sure enough now this is there's gonna be a lot more space.

10:40.350 --> 10:43.320
So if we want to collect something let's say again we can choose Java.

10:43.770 --> 10:44.820
And this is gonna work.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.610
So let's say if we wanna test it all.

10:46.620 --> 10:52.090
But let me just write some mumbo jumbo gibberish here and add something to the email this is gonna work.

10:52.090 --> 11:00.240
This is gonna be inscription Jar Jar Jar our Java and something let's say from the select is gonna be

11:00.240 --> 11:01.570
select as a job.

11:01.590 --> 11:08.520
And again we can just submit now in the URL we're gonna see our key value pairs if we're going to copy

11:08.520 --> 11:11.880
paste it or whatever if we're gonna name this bigger notice.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.800
Now these are gonna be the value pairs key value pairs there are going to be some.

11:16.140 --> 11:21.840
Again in our case we don't care about them we only will gonna care about them has we start working with

11:21.840 --> 11:28.460
some back in language but this would be the general principles of working with the forms and the HMO.
