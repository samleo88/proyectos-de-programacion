WEBVTT

00:00.290 --> 00:00.870
All right.

00:00.870 --> 00:06.390
We know the basics about the linear grains How about we check it out some external resources that are

00:06.390 --> 00:09.810
gonna help us tremendously as we're working with linear ingredients.

00:10.230 --> 00:15.420
So we're gonna head over to our good goals for Google and then I'm gonna write not learn I'm going to

00:15.430 --> 00:19.630
say CSX he near a gradient generator.

00:19.650 --> 00:21.100
So that's gonna be my text.

00:21.240 --> 00:26.040
Now the moment we take that surprise surprise this is what we're gonna be getting in our search and

00:26.040 --> 00:30.360
we're gonna be looking for is yes as gradient generator from the colors.

00:30.420 --> 00:35.490
Now what's really cool about this is that we can come up with whatever colors we would like and we can

00:35.490 --> 00:40.710
really set up our gradient and they all gonna spit out that the code and we just need to copy and paste

00:40.710 --> 00:42.310
it into our browser.

00:42.420 --> 00:46.480
Meaning I'm sorry into to our tech center now you'll see a lot of mumbo jumbo here.

00:46.800 --> 00:52.140
And the reason for that is we're not gonna cover this right now but there is something called browser

00:52.140 --> 00:53.280
prefixes.

00:53.280 --> 00:58.500
And don't worry about them right now again only thing you need to do is just grab just code and copy

00:58.500 --> 01:04.140
and paste it and everything is gonna be working fine in your project later on towards the end of the

01:04.200 --> 01:06.800
CSO senatorial before we start working on the project.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.850
We're just gonna take a look at what are the browser prefixes and why would want to use them.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.320
But for now probably don't pay too much of attention over here.

01:15.570 --> 01:20.170
And I know there's a lot of code in here but just keep in mind that you only need to copy and paste

01:20.170 --> 01:21.640
it and you're good to go.

01:21.660 --> 01:27.990
Now first let's say we can choose whatever directions there's gonna be or orientation horizontal vertical

01:27.990 --> 01:34.760
diagonal radial doesn't really matter let's go with a horizontal then also we can choose the color format.

01:34.780 --> 01:37.550
Now we can go hex or we can go with our GBM.

01:37.560 --> 01:40.740
Now I can tell you right away even though you're going to choose the hex color.

01:40.740 --> 01:45.660
However if you're not start changing the opacity what's gonna happen is we all going to automatically

01:45.660 --> 01:47.070
switch to our GPA.

01:47.220 --> 01:53.280
So just because you picked text if you're going to let's say change the opacity or transparency then

01:53.280 --> 01:56.300
the format is automatically going to be our GPA.

01:56.310 --> 01:59.370
Now let's say this would be the hex color so what kind of color you would like.

01:59.370 --> 02:02.220
Again we click on this box here we just click here.

02:02.220 --> 02:06.060
Let's say we want to go with the red one you want to change the opacity.

02:06.080 --> 02:06.530
Here we go.

02:06.530 --> 02:08.070
We can change the opacity.

02:08.130 --> 02:11.150
We can say that I don't know what the pastor is going to be something like this.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.740
And again we can clip it here.

02:12.930 --> 02:15.990
So then we'll do the same thing where I'm changing the opacity.

02:15.990 --> 02:20.770
So now this is gonna be a little bit more transparent than the same thing I can do over here.

02:20.880 --> 02:23.380
Let's go here maybe with the green one.

02:23.430 --> 02:25.020
This is not what I want.

02:25.210 --> 02:29.300
I would want to click Oh here and then I'm gonna say I don't know.

02:29.670 --> 02:31.200
Are we picking something like this.

02:31.240 --> 02:35.600
So that's pretty much going to be my transparency right here.

02:35.700 --> 02:41.010
And then also if you want to change something here let's say color you want to remove this color just

02:41.010 --> 02:42.050
delete it.

02:42.060 --> 02:45.550
So I would just say here that there's that just delete it.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.070
So we get this color.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.530
You want to delete this color or we can delete this color.

02:49.860 --> 02:51.710
So now we're getting this hard.

02:51.720 --> 02:53.090
You want to add one more color.

02:53.100 --> 02:56.000
Let's say you change your mind as you're hovering Norris.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.000
We can just click it here.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.020
This is going to on the plus side and let's say that this is gonna be my color.

03:01.050 --> 03:06.990
Now I'm not going to show you each and every possible option or understand that this gives you a lot

03:06.990 --> 03:08.140
of flexibility.

03:08.160 --> 03:12.420
So like I said what we would need to do is just grab this code that we have.

03:12.540 --> 03:13.300
Again we can.

03:13.410 --> 03:19.550
There's many ways we can copy this but I mean I'm just gonna select this all we can copy and I'm gonna

03:19.560 --> 03:21.650
head over back to the next e-mail.

03:21.810 --> 03:25.310
I'm gonna call this Dave I don't know what color zilla.

03:25.470 --> 03:28.480
Just so we can see that color zilla.

03:28.540 --> 03:31.850
This is how they were spelling ultimate colors zilla.

03:31.860 --> 03:33.300
Yeah I think that's gonna be fine.

03:33.780 --> 03:41.180
And then we'll save the stars assess as well as well just gonna have the colors Zilla and you know what

03:41.190 --> 03:42.090
let's do it like this.

03:42.120 --> 03:45.570
Let's just copy and paste it and see how this is gonna work.

03:45.910 --> 03:47.220
So if I'm gonna save it.

03:47.220 --> 03:53.740
Sure enough this is gonna be my Dave and I have everything working with my gradients.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.990
So we have successfully copy and paste it.

03:56.110 --> 04:01.310
Now if you want to change the direction you can always change direction and so on and so forth.

04:01.350 --> 04:07.700
So if you don't want to let change just settle for the basic colors that we're picking only two colors.

04:07.800 --> 04:12.060
You can always head over to color though and pick whatever gradient you would like.
