We will start very basic by looking at a fund family property and ultimately fund family property describes

00:08.250 --> 00:15.450
the fund of an element and as a side note we did already cover fund size property which would be responsible

00:15.450 --> 00:17.920
for the size of the tax now.

00:17.920 --> 00:23.020
As you can see right now I already deleted everything that we had in the previous module because I wanted

00:23.020 --> 00:27.700
to start fresh in the indexation demo as well as style assets.

00:27.790 --> 00:29.460
So if you need to do the same.

00:29.620 --> 00:33.100
Please pause the video and resume whenever you're ready to go.

00:33.820 --> 00:40.180
Let's start simply in the indexation email by creating the ending one and in the heading One let's say

00:40.450 --> 00:45.790
Hey dude I am heading or main heading.

00:45.790 --> 00:52.980
Let's call this main heading as well as we can also create paragraph and for the paragraph let's.

00:53.020 --> 00:56.170
I don't know I had some 50 words in here or something like this.

00:56.170 --> 00:58.810
Let's have 50 words and we're gonna save our email.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.510
So far so good.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.750
We have the heading and we have the program.

01:02.800 --> 01:08.890
If I'm gonna head over to SCA says you can just select the whole body and since we already have covered

01:08.890 --> 01:15.880
the inheritance we know that if we're not going to change anything with any of the elements they will

01:15.880 --> 01:18.830
get inheritance from the parent which would be the body.

01:19.450 --> 01:23.920
So in our case we're going to do like this we're going to save on family and I don't know let's go with

01:23.920 --> 01:25.520
Helvetica.

01:25.690 --> 01:31.330
Something like this let's save it and first of all we right away notice that our font family changed.

01:31.990 --> 01:32.520
OK.

01:32.590 --> 01:33.550
Awesome.

01:33.550 --> 01:38.500
Now I'm going to head over to hearing one and more specifically change my font family.

01:38.600 --> 01:45.360
So what happens is that we can change the family of the font or whatever element we would like.

01:45.560 --> 01:51.290
And in most cases this is exactly what you're to do you're gonna set up some kind of funds for probably

01:51.350 --> 01:52.500
most of your project.

01:52.700 --> 01:56.800
And then there's gonna be specific elements like headings or paragraphs.

01:56.930 --> 01:59.000
Doesn't really matter in your situation.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.560
It really depends on that.

02:01.130 --> 02:05.860
But you're gonna change the font family for specific type of element.

02:05.960 --> 02:11.410
In my case I'm just gonna change for my having one which may be for project could be holes heading.

02:11.970 --> 02:15.330
So here let's say again from family let's write.

02:15.350 --> 02:16.530
I don't know Donna.

02:16.760 --> 02:17.960
Something like this.

02:17.980 --> 02:19.090
I'd say Donna.

02:19.130 --> 02:26.420
And now I can see that even though the paragraph inherits this from the body the Vertica then the heading

02:26.420 --> 02:30.800
One is gonna be more specifically with the Verdun Donna font family.

02:30.830 --> 02:36.370
This is as straightforward as it gets where you can just pick whatever on family you would like and

02:36.380 --> 02:39.880
just add it with fun family property to that specific element.
