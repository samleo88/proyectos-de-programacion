WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:03.090
Once we are done with rest of the sections.

00:03.090 --> 00:05.580
Now we have only left a number.

00:05.820 --> 00:09.070
So here you can see that this is how it's going to look on the big screen.

00:09.090 --> 00:14.860
However once we're going to make it on the small screen we're going to create a button and on her knees

00:14.880 --> 00:16.230
are going to be our looks.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.860
So let's go ahead and let's start working on our number.

00:20.050 --> 00:22.900
So going to go back here to my index.

00:23.370 --> 00:29.550
I'm actually going to go all the way to the top because remember actually Howard Navarre was our first

00:29.640 --> 00:30.490
child.

00:30.750 --> 00:36.840
Now we have so far he's heading one with a halo which we actually don't need if we're going to scroll

00:36.840 --> 00:39.840
up or here you can see there's nothing here.

00:39.930 --> 00:42.300
However now we're going to start placing everything.

00:42.670 --> 00:50.220
And the good news is that we do not need to do anything with a lay out regarding the actual banner because

00:50.220 --> 00:51.780
we already set up everything.

00:51.930 --> 00:55.920
We are in make sure that the banner is going to be pushing as much as it can.

00:56.100 --> 01:00.070
So as much as that bar needs a room we're going to create.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.800
So first things first.

01:01.800 --> 01:07.740
Now I would want in your head for someone to say I have had her and then how are you going to have a

01:07.740 --> 01:09.500
logo and a button.

01:09.690 --> 01:15.310
So here we're going to say I have two underscores her on here.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.680
And for the better what I would want inside.

01:17.730 --> 01:21.740
Like I said would be first a logo.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.400
So here I'm going to say this is going to be.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.630
Now I have to underscore.

01:25.860 --> 01:33.100
Well go on KNOW this and for the source we're going to have image and image is going to be logo here.

01:33.110 --> 01:38.330
So once I say well you can see on here now I have my logo also right next to the logo.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.190
I want my button.

01:40.270 --> 01:46.750
So I'm going to go back over here and if I'm going to write sparen now I have 200 scores between or

01:46.830 --> 01:48.240
here are going to write on.

01:48.530 --> 01:57.960
And this is going to be a are and then we're going to have a hand point down so point and are going

01:57.960 --> 01:58.760
to write down.

01:58.980 --> 02:03.490
So once we press the tab here and see that I have my little icon.

02:03.900 --> 02:07.240
So this would be with a nav bar header.

02:07.500 --> 02:13.260
So if we have a nav bar header now I would want to create a links so here I'm going to say right now

02:13.260 --> 02:22.350
I have links and all the links we're going to create a list with a class of nav links and all here we're

02:22.350 --> 02:24.550
going to start placing a list items.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.070
So here we're going to have a list item.

02:27.210 --> 02:35.370
Now in the list Adam there is going to be a link and all this is going to have class Nav. single or

02:35.370 --> 02:36.870
here link.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.170
So this is going to be my class name.

02:39.450 --> 02:42.420
And also here on this is going to have text.

02:42.560 --> 02:47.960
So here Heroes are going to press it and we're going to write them this is going to be a mantra.

02:48.150 --> 02:53.010
And now we can just copy and paste them and we know that we need six of them so we need to copy and

02:53.010 --> 02:54.630
paste these five more times.

02:54.660 --> 02:58.000
So one two three four five on here.

02:58.170 --> 03:03.500
Now the only thing I would need to do is just write off here what kind of links this is.

03:03.540 --> 03:06.550
So here I'm going to write and this is going to be home.

03:06.810 --> 03:09.320
Then we're going to have an about that.

03:09.330 --> 03:17.160
Also we're here we're just going to have a services services here and once we say what you can see that

03:17.160 --> 03:18.960
our links are here.

03:19.260 --> 03:23.270
Then after the services we're going to have an inverse.

03:23.430 --> 03:28.320
Now after the numbers are actually going to have a project here.

03:28.450 --> 03:33.440
So let me just it these are going to be projects projects.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.650
And the last one out here is going to be contact.

03:36.720 --> 03:41.350
So again look we can go here and this is going to be my contact.

03:41.370 --> 03:49.710
So on the other side actually we would want a contact so can act or here.

03:49.850 --> 03:50.710
So that's save.

03:50.750 --> 03:53.560
And I can see that I am Hillings.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.710
I have my Herro here and I have my button.

03:56.780 --> 04:00.200
So now I would need to go to see this and actually Styler.
