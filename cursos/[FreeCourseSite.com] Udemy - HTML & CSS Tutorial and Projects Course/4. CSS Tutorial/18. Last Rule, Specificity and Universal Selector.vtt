00:00.530 --> 00:08.240
As you start working with CSX inevitably you are going to meet the last rule principle as well as specificity.

00:08.450 --> 00:14.850
And then you also going to see later on whenever we are working we have universal select and I'm gonna

00:14.870 --> 00:21.230
kind of lump them together because I think all of them pretty much work on a principle of the previous

00:21.230 --> 00:21.380
one.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.190
So let's start with a last rule.

00:24.260 --> 00:30.790
So let's imagine this scenario again we have our Dave we have had him two and then here I have to program.

00:30.980 --> 00:36.140
Now let's just get rid of all the styles just so you don't get confused and let's imagine they're all

00:36.140 --> 00:38.060
going to be styling just a paragraph by itself.

00:38.600 --> 00:43.350
So when we get as always we're going to use the color example and I'm gonna say color is blue.

00:43.460 --> 00:51.440
Now if I'm gonna later on in the same style sheet had the same selection for the paragraph with a different

00:51.440 --> 00:53.900
color what do you think is gonna happen.

00:53.900 --> 00:58.070
So let's say here I'm going to say a paragraph and in my case this is gonna be red.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.470
Now what do you think is gonna happen.

01:00.470 --> 01:06.350
Well we can already see that paragraphs are right now and to be with a color of red.

01:06.350 --> 01:07.940
Now why is that happening.

01:07.940 --> 01:14.700
Well because CSX is gonna use the last rule that you added and then apply that to the station.

01:14.840 --> 01:20.680
Now usually what's gonna happen is that you're gonna be kind of hard working with your CSX and you're

01:20.700 --> 01:25.820
gonna be adding lines and lines and lines and CSX and then later on you're gonna come here somewhere

01:25.820 --> 01:31.280
on line thirty two or three thousand and forty nine and then you're all gonna add in the that.

01:31.460 --> 01:36.260
So what happens is that you're going to kind of fuse the fact that you already have your style selection

01:36.260 --> 01:36.810
or here.

01:36.860 --> 01:43.160
And he says it's gonna be like Okay so you had your first rule or whatever second rule or whatever but

01:43.160 --> 01:45.080
later on you actually create a new one.

01:45.530 --> 01:51.630
So I'm going to use right now in the fact that you added this last rule and I'm gonna apply only the.

01:52.010 --> 01:58.190
So please remember whenever you're working that your last rule is gonna be applied regardless of what

01:58.190 --> 01:59.180
you have in between.

01:59.780 --> 02:04.090
So that's something to really too important to remember because there's gonna be cases where you're

02:04.100 --> 02:09.820
going to find yourself looking for the reasoning of why certain C S S is displayed.

02:09.830 --> 02:16.280
So always check whether you haven't applied another rule that pretty much overrides your initial one.

02:16.310 --> 02:19.610
No I also have a topic of specificity.

02:19.850 --> 02:21.380
Now what would that mean.

02:21.380 --> 02:23.880
Well okay let's look at the same example.

02:24.080 --> 02:27.120
We have one paragraph and the second one.

02:27.410 --> 02:30.340
So let's add maybe some kind of class to them.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.250
Well let's write.

02:31.250 --> 02:36.330
Class is going to be read here as well as for this guy.

02:36.410 --> 02:42.100
Let's add the class and right now what happens if I'm gonna head over again back and assess first of

02:42.100 --> 02:44.030
all let's tile the class of red.

02:44.210 --> 02:48.140
Let's write obviously the color and in our case is going to be red.

02:48.140 --> 02:54.620
But let's say that later on again somewhere in the document we're going to write that where all my paragraphs

02:54.620 --> 02:58.010
in this case I would like to style them blue.

02:58.040 --> 03:02.930
Do you think there are gonna be blue right now since we just covered the last rule or there's still

03:02.930 --> 03:03.440
gonna be red.

03:04.100 --> 03:08.400
Well my to out as you notice they are staying red.

03:08.450 --> 03:14.750
And the reason for that is even though we are applying this with a last rule the first rule is more

03:14.750 --> 03:15.290
specific.

03:15.830 --> 03:22.430
So what's happening with CSX CSX has a specific measurement system for specificity.

03:22.430 --> 03:29.170
And if you want to be really diligent about that you can just go ahead and google specificity measurement

03:29.180 --> 03:30.290
in CSX.

03:30.290 --> 03:35.480
Now I'm not going to cover this because I don't really find it useful right now especially if we're

03:35.480 --> 03:37.730
just starting with CSX.

03:37.730 --> 03:42.600
However if you would like to go and explore on your own you're more than welcome to do that.

03:42.710 --> 03:49.100
And at the very beginning I believe I would go with W3 schools again because their explanation probably

03:49.100 --> 03:54.680
is gonna be the most straightforward especially as you're just starting out with a CSX.

03:54.710 --> 04:00.590
Now I'd also like to cover very quickly the fact that we have the universal selector which select all

04:00.590 --> 04:01.440
they own.

04:01.550 --> 04:07.190
So if I'm just going to get rid of this and if I'm gonna say there's gonna be universal selector and

04:07.190 --> 04:14.030
the way we type universal selector is by this asterisk and again let's add some kind of value so let's

04:14.030 --> 04:16.400
say color is gonna be blue.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.580
All my elements are going to meet the blue.

04:18.620 --> 04:26.090
However the kicker here is that universal selector has the least amount of the actual specificity.

04:26.090 --> 04:30.780
So even though we can add this at the very end if we're gonna be overwriting this somewhere.

04:30.780 --> 04:34.780
So let's say again for the paragraphs we're gonna say color red.

04:34.950 --> 04:39.940
Then the actual universal selector is gonna be the least powerful one.

04:40.310 --> 04:43.160
So it's gonna have the least amount of specificity.

04:43.190 --> 04:49.610
Now we are using universal selector whenever we want to reset the default browser stars which we will

04:49.610 --> 04:55.130
going to cover a little bit later and we will gonna use this universal selector as we start working

04:55.130 --> 04:56.270
with the project.

04:56.270 --> 05:03.430
But in general this is all it's gonna do it's gonna select all the however with least amount of specificity.
