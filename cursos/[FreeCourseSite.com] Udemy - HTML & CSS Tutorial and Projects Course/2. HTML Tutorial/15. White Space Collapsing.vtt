I also need to mention the page the memo is whitespace collapsing and you're probably first question

00:06.960 --> 00:08.460
is whitespace.

00:08.460 --> 00:10.380
What and what does that mean.

00:10.990 --> 00:16.440
Well whitespace collapsing means that the memo is just going to ignore extra spaces.

00:16.620 --> 00:20.990
Now it's gonna be easier for me to show you than talk about for three hours.

00:21.120 --> 00:26.970
So first of all let's say that there's gonna be a hearing 3 that will be on top of the program and in

00:26.970 --> 00:32.790
the heading three I would like to write Hello World War I would decide that things are gonna be better

00:32.790 --> 00:34.100
for my website.

00:34.320 --> 00:38.310
I'm gonna add like and I know whatever amount of spaces in between.

00:38.310 --> 00:42.300
Now what do you think is gonna be rendered on the right side in the life server.

00:42.560 --> 00:43.980
I'm only gonna say this.

00:43.980 --> 00:45.210
Check this out.

00:45.210 --> 00:48.480
All the extra white spaces were ignored by the email.

00:48.600 --> 00:54.360
Now the same would work if I would try to create some space in between the adding 3 and paragraph.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.730
Again we can test it out the same way.

00:56.730 --> 00:59.600
The moment I'm gonna save it nothing is going to change on the right side.

00:59.730 --> 01:05.490
And not because there's some error or the life service not working but because of the simple fact that

01:05.660 --> 01:08.370
the email is ignoring all this whitespace.

01:08.370 --> 01:15.870
Now the point of this is that in HDMI if we would like to create spaces in between the elements or within

01:15.870 --> 01:20.030
the elements we need to use special HDMI elements.

01:20.070 --> 01:22.030
Now look at them a little bit later.

01:22.200 --> 01:28.170
But again if you have been testing it out and if you're confused why if you're adding a space in between

01:28.170 --> 01:29.280
it's not working.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.730
The reason for that is HDMI all is whitespace collapsing.
