00:00.560 --> 00:06.780
Now one thing I forgot to mention is in fact that I also would like to fix my hero.

00:06.830 --> 00:08.180
Now what do I mean by that.

00:08.180 --> 00:14.900
Well what happens is that once we get to a bigger screen says notice that nav bar has some kind of height

00:14.960 --> 00:16.490
already correct.

00:16.490 --> 00:22.550
Now what I would like to do is in fact use that height when I'm setting up my hero because currently

00:22.550 --> 00:24.880
what happens if I'm looking at it.

00:24.890 --> 00:28.030
My hero is hundred new heights correct.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.680
And then I have my number.

00:29.720 --> 00:31.940
So in fact I'm scrolling up and down.

00:32.120 --> 00:36.430
Now what I would like to do is first of all check how big is my number.

00:36.530 --> 00:39.240
And we can do that by using dev tools.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.560
So I'm gonna head over back to my project.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.680
I'm gonna write inspect or are not gonna write.

00:44.690 --> 00:47.700
I'm gonna look for my developer tools by right clicking.

00:47.900 --> 00:53.270
And then if we check out our number you're going to notice that there's going to be a width and height

00:53.640 --> 00:57.110
and in my case height is sixty two pixels.

00:57.110 --> 00:59.690
Now you can also check it over here.

00:59.690 --> 01:03.570
Notice how you have this padding all where you have sixteen and sixteen.

01:03.740 --> 01:11.220
Plus you have 30 so 30 is for the content and then we have 16 and 16 and total is going to be 62.

01:11.240 --> 01:15.770
So what I would like to do is you know where we have the hero.

01:15.890 --> 01:20.010
So let me find in this case hero hero.

01:20.020 --> 01:24.010
Once we find a hero we had the mean height of hundred v heads.

01:24.010 --> 01:32.460
So what I would like to do instead is not make it hundred view hides but actually subtract these 62

01:32.460 --> 01:38.170
pixels so that I weigh my nav bar and my hero our hundred yards.

01:38.220 --> 01:47.130
So the way we do that we just write Hulk minus minus 62 pixels.

01:47.590 --> 01:55.150
So that way our setup is going to be where once we open up the page this is exactly hundred percent

01:55.420 --> 01:57.350
hundred viewers both of them.

01:57.550 --> 02:01.240
Now bar as well as the hero component.

02:01.240 --> 02:06.700
So that way just looks a little bit nicer whereas we start scrolling we're right away get to the next

02:06.700 --> 02:07.440
section.

02:07.480 --> 02:13.060
Not a big deal but something that I thought I should mention before we move on and start working with

02:13.060 --> 02:13.660
the javascript.
