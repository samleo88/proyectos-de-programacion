00:00.190 --> 00:04.130
And this moment in time my original document is small.

00:04.140 --> 00:09.130
I would even say tiny so adding comments would probably be an overkill.

00:09.720 --> 00:16.020
However as your projects are gonna grow bigger in size it's wise to have some kind of documentation.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.850
What is happening in the project for us.

00:18.870 --> 00:21.590
We use the comments in an email.

00:21.770 --> 00:24.630
Now the syntax for the comment would be very simple.

00:24.660 --> 00:30.400
We have the angle bracket then we're going to be looking for exclamation mark and then we have to dash.

00:30.850 --> 00:34.910
Now the moment you type that as you notice you're having this green line.

00:34.940 --> 00:38.760
So now whatever we're going to write is not going to be shown on a web page.

00:38.760 --> 00:42.290
So in order to test it out you can just say hello there.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.600
Notice what I'm gonna say.

00:44.710 --> 00:47.210
It's not going to be shown here on a webpage.

00:47.250 --> 00:50.320
Now again we can write here a novel if we would like to.

00:50.460 --> 00:56.190
But in general you would just write some kind of comments about what is happening whether you were working

00:56.190 --> 01:00.650
with the team or whether you're just working on this by yourself.

01:00.780 --> 01:07.740
Because trust me if you work on something let's say two weeks ago and then again you load the file on

01:07.740 --> 01:13.650
your starting going through comments really help you to get up and running of what's happening in your

01:13.650 --> 01:20.820
project because even though you created it trust me two weeks later it's gonna be hard for you to remember.

01:20.850 --> 01:26.070
Now we also have an option of just creating comments with a shortcut and that shortcut would be very

01:26.070 --> 01:26.970
simple.

01:26.970 --> 01:32.220
We would have to press command and then forward slash the forward slash is gonna be left from your shift

01:32.220 --> 01:35.460
key and then just like that again we have the comment.

01:35.820 --> 01:43.620
So let's say here I could say you get me image image and then I'm gonna head over to where the second

01:43.620 --> 01:44.920
having three is.

01:45.040 --> 01:49.300
Again I'm going to create another comment and let's say laptop image again.

01:49.470 --> 01:55.260
In this case this would be clearly an overkill but in general this is how we would work with comments.

01:55.280 --> 01:59.550
Now I also would like to show you how we can use the line break because having a comment is one thing

01:59.800 --> 02:00.330
or you know what.

02:00.330 --> 02:02.060
No I forgot to tell you something.

02:02.130 --> 02:08.460
We also have an option of adding the code within the comment that we would like to hide or that particular

02:08.460 --> 02:08.830
time.

02:09.330 --> 02:14.640
So let's say that I would like to just check how this image on the laptop was gonna look like.

02:15.300 --> 02:18.770
However I wouldn't want to delete the DMA altogether.

02:18.810 --> 02:24.840
So what we can do all here is we can create a comment and as you can see this would be my comment.

02:24.840 --> 02:30.630
And if I'm gonna place whatever regime elements I would like within this comment they're not going to

02:30.630 --> 02:32.100
be displayed on a page.

02:32.100 --> 02:35.510
So for now I just cut them out and copy and paste them in here.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.520
Now notice first of all they're green.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.750
So we can see already that they're not going to be rendered.

02:40.830 --> 02:43.180
And the moment I'm going to service trying this out.

02:43.470 --> 02:47.340
So obviously I don't have this anymore rendered image.

02:47.340 --> 02:52.750
Now obviously if you would like to render it again just delete the comments and everything is gonna

02:52.770 --> 02:53.490
be working fine.

02:53.940 --> 02:58.500
So that's another use where you would use the comment where let's say you would like to test something

02:58.500 --> 03:02.780
out of something looks but you don't want to delete that other part.

03:02.880 --> 03:08.490
Then you would just basically comment it out now like I said back to the line breaks because as you

03:08.490 --> 03:13.890
can see even though I'm adding here let's say more space in my email hours and nothing is happening

03:13.890 --> 03:18.080
in my webpage because again I actually email would be whitespace collapsing.

03:18.330 --> 03:23.280
So instead we would need to use the element and the element would be Lindberg.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.120
Now the syntax for the Lindberg would be very simple.

03:26.250 --> 03:28.610
We would just need to write booyah.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.090
And again we can use them for that obviously.

03:31.250 --> 03:35.090
And obviously if I'm going to press on it not as this.

03:35.130 --> 03:37.260
Now I'm starting to get some kind of line breaks.

03:37.740 --> 03:39.630
Now that ours is only one break.

03:39.630 --> 03:45.040
So let me just copy and paste it to have a few more just so we can see for sure that we have more.

03:45.060 --> 03:50.610
One two three or four something and the one terminal served notice I'm getting line breaks.

03:50.820 --> 03:56.340
Not that would work whether in between the image and having three as well as if we're going to have

03:56.340 --> 03:57.940
some line breaks over here.

03:58.020 --> 04:04.740
So again we just cut this out or copy paste it and we can do the same thing over here and obviously

04:04.740 --> 04:09.900
the more line breaks we're going to add apologies then the more space you're going to have in between.
