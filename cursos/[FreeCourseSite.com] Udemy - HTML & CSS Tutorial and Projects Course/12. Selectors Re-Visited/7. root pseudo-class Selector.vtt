WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:07.170
We also have an option of using the route pseudo class selector where we're styling the root element

00:07.290 --> 00:12.830
of the document which in our case is gonna be h the email document and right off the bat I can tell

00:12.830 --> 00:18.660
that this is probably gonna be used mostly for general styles as well as we all gonna use it with C

00:18.650 --> 00:21.800
assessed variables that we haven't covered yet.

00:21.810 --> 00:26.880
Now this is gonna work well first of all let's get rid of all this old garbage.

00:26.880 --> 00:30.800
Well not really garbage but I just needed to use some kind of word.

00:30.870 --> 00:37.020
So let's get rid of the old code then in the indexation email we're going to add or not create adding

00:37.080 --> 00:37.480
one.

00:37.740 --> 00:39.420
That's not what I wanted to do.

00:39.480 --> 00:43.480
So I'd like to delete them here and let's start by having one.

00:43.520 --> 00:46.420
And this is gonna be simple heading one having one.

00:46.440 --> 00:53.250
Let's say I am heading and then let's add two paragraphs now for the paragraphs though I would want

00:53.250 --> 01:00.390
to have two classes of there's gonna be paragraph with Lauren so not 20 words as well as I would like

01:00.390 --> 01:01.660
to add the class.

01:01.700 --> 01:07.050
Now the class is going to be absolute doesn't really matter how you call the class as long as you as

01:07.050 --> 01:13.650
always remember how to actually start in a C assess meaning you remembered a name so you can access

01:13.650 --> 01:20.160
the class and here let's say responsive then we're gonna have a look at what would be the difference

01:20.640 --> 01:21.770
within the root element.

01:21.810 --> 01:22.620
So far so good.

01:22.620 --> 01:25.570
So we have all reached the email now for the road.

01:25.590 --> 01:27.400
Again we're gonna do something like this.

01:27.600 --> 01:33.110
And the most basic way would be doing well let's say background is going to be read.

01:33.210 --> 01:35.770
Now again this is something we already have covered.

01:35.910 --> 01:41.320
So obviously if we're selecting the h a melon we're saying that the background should be read.

01:41.460 --> 01:47.580
What happens is that since this is very much the route of oral document just because we start this thread

01:47.610 --> 01:50.120
obviously right now we're gonna have the background right.

01:50.340 --> 01:51.110
So far so good.

01:51.150 --> 01:52.150
Very simple.

01:52.170 --> 01:57.840
Now if this is annoying or can just come into out maybe some of you hate the red color especially since

01:57.840 --> 01:59.250
it's for the whole background.

01:59.700 --> 02:04.740
But what is more interesting and what it would be the cases apart from CFS variables that we haven't

02:04.740 --> 02:07.020
covered but we will gonna cover later.

02:07.050 --> 02:12.540
And again I'm willing to revisit the root because this we're all gonna be setting up the variables but

02:12.540 --> 02:14.010
where else we can use the root.

02:14.040 --> 02:19.380
Now we can use it for general styles so let's say that I would have a heading one and in the font size

02:19.380 --> 02:20.200
is here.

02:20.220 --> 02:25.160
I don't know could be anything as long as you're using the harem.

02:25.170 --> 02:29.490
So I'm just gonna say font size is gonna be three areas.

02:29.620 --> 02:32.750
So remember this was responsive values.

02:32.950 --> 02:39.820
However they were responsive towards the root so they were responsive as the root was changing.

02:39.820 --> 02:40.560
Okay.

02:40.630 --> 02:43.390
What about the paragraph that was absolute.

02:43.400 --> 02:48.230
Let's use actually the absolute values which would be pixels.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.460
And you're gonna say font size of 20 pixels.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.900
Now we're also trying to do is for the responsive one.

02:56.020 --> 03:01.270
I had the same value just with our M values because remember the whole idea was like this.

03:01.300 --> 03:05.660
That one our M was actually 16 pixels correct.

03:05.670 --> 03:08.110
That was the default one coming from the browser.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.120
So this should be exactly the same.

03:10.510 --> 03:13.640
So the question here is for the responsive one.

03:13.660 --> 03:17.000
If I'm gonna add let's say one point five.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.430
What is that going to be.

03:18.430 --> 03:25.330
Well if we do a little bit of math we know on that sixteen one point five meaning this would be 24 because

03:25.330 --> 03:28.940
we had one full sixteen and then we would add eight.

03:28.960 --> 03:32.730
So in that case we would be getting exactly the same 24.

03:32.770 --> 03:38.540
Now if you don't believe me think you can just check it out here in the browser and we'll see the both

03:38.560 --> 03:40.440
of them are exactly the same.

03:40.510 --> 03:42.730
So where does the root element come in right now.

03:43.570 --> 03:49.630
Well we already know that the reason why we're using the arms is that lets say if the user would like

03:49.630 --> 03:50.800
to change the font size.

03:51.340 --> 03:57.140
So if the user of the like you know what I don't like how the sponsor lets say too big or too small

03:57.490 --> 04:03.940
so the user cannot go always actually to their settings and the way we go to the settings again we click

04:03.940 --> 04:08.610
on this icon then we're looking for the settings and then within the settings we have the font size.

04:08.860 --> 04:14.800
So what happens is if we're gonna change this let's say to the very large the text that was used with

04:14.800 --> 04:17.240
our Iams is going to become very large.

04:17.240 --> 04:18.490
Now don't believe me.

04:18.520 --> 04:24.640
Notice this is large already we know this but we cannot see it technically that this was bigger than

04:24.640 --> 04:25.720
it used to be.

04:25.720 --> 04:31.600
However we can see it here with due paragraph where previously they were exactly the same because they

04:31.600 --> 04:33.550
were 24 pixels.

04:33.670 --> 04:39.240
The moment we change the settings on a user because this is depending on the settings on a user.

04:39.250 --> 04:41.120
Now this is getting much more bigger.

04:41.220 --> 04:44.130
Okay so that was just something we already have covered.

04:44.170 --> 04:48.640
Let me put this back on a medium just so we can see that again most of them are going to be exactly

04:48.640 --> 04:49.490
the same.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.620
And now let's look at the root element.

04:51.940 --> 04:57.880
So what's happening is if we're gonna be styling something relative the route we can go back to the

04:57.880 --> 04:59.500
route and we can change these settings.

05:00.070 --> 05:03.310
So let's say in this case our styling everything towards the road.

05:03.700 --> 05:10.120
So my heading one was three our Amazon obviously most likely you're going to have your paragraphs that

05:10.180 --> 05:11.520
are gonna be smaller.

05:11.620 --> 05:14.440
However they were smaller relative to the route.

05:14.500 --> 05:20.440
So if I'm gonna make a change here of let's say font size and if I'm going to start changing with the

05:20.440 --> 05:25.810
percentages if I'm going to say 100 percent nothing is going to change because this is still going to

05:25.810 --> 05:27.330
mean 16 pixels.

05:27.340 --> 05:31.860
However if we're gonna go hundred and fifty pixels notice what happens.

05:31.870 --> 05:39.100
So now we're increasing the value here by these 50 percent but this was relative to the actual route.

05:39.490 --> 05:45.260
So everything that we can change within this property in the road what we're going to have is the responsive

05:45.290 --> 05:52.200
values but again the absolute one didn't change because absolute was just 24 pixels.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.630
And I'm good to go.

05:53.710 --> 05:58.550
The relative one is the one that you can say okay this is gonna be three arms.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.920
So relative to the road.

06:00.160 --> 06:04.990
So if you're going to be changing something let's say you can make the whole document whole what page

06:04.990 --> 06:11.530
whole whatever application and at the end of the day you can be like Yeah well three arms is OK.

06:11.550 --> 06:16.510
And one point five but I would want to make it bigger so you can head over back to the road and you

06:16.510 --> 06:22.030
can just change these values and it will gonna be affected all throughout the document where you use

06:22.030 --> 06:25.150
the responsive values that are related to the root.
