1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,220
Alright guys, so what we're going to do

2

00:00:02,220  -->  00:00:04,799
is we're going to extend this to allow

3

00:00:04,799  -->  00:00:07,589
us to have multiple party members. We

4

00:00:07,589  -->  00:00:09,630
still need to do a lot of AI or

5

00:00:09,630  -->  00:00:11,519
artificial intelligence for the enemy,

6

00:00:11,519  -->  00:00:14,549
and we're just that's just not a

7

00:00:14,549  -->  00:00:15,630
priority right now.

8

00:00:15,630  -->  00:00:18,060
So, what we need to do is make a space

9

00:00:18,060  -->  00:00:20,550
for our multiple players and what I mean

10

00:00:20,550  -->  00:00:23,130
by that is over here in the terminal

11

00:00:23,130  -->  00:00:26,369
when we're actually playing the role

12

00:00:26,369  -->  00:00:27,900
playing game it doesn't look as pretty

13

00:00:27,900  -->  00:00:30,179
as I want it to, and so we're going to set

14

00:00:30,179  -->  00:00:31,800
this up to make it easier on the eyes

15

00:00:31,800  -->  00:00:33,239
for when you're printing out multiple

16

00:00:33,239  -->  00:00:36,600
party members data. We are going to make

17

00:00:36,600  -->  00:00:38,550
progress bars and they're going to be

18

00:00:38,550  -->  00:00:40,469
the hit points are going to be 25

19

00:00:40,469  -->  00:00:45,120
characters long so that we can turn the

20

00:00:45,120  -->  00:00:47,579
remaining hit points into a percentage.

21

00:00:47,579  -->  00:00:49,920
Let's say we have 60 out of 100

22

00:00:49,920  -->  00:00:52,530
percent, so 60% hit point left,

23

00:00:52,530  -->  00:00:55,050
then we want to divide both of those

24

00:00:55,050  -->  00:00:57,270
numbers by 25 so we can get how many

25

00:00:57,270  -->  00:01:00,120
spaces we need to fill up the progress

26

00:01:00,120  -->  00:01:02,039
bar in. So, it's going to be a little bit

27

00:01:02,039  -->  00:01:04,650
of math, but not too much. So, what we're

28

00:01:04,650  -->  00:01:05,880
going to do is I'm going to print out a

29

00:01:05,880  -->  00:01:07,710
very static version of it and we're also

30

00:01:07,710  -->  00:01:09,299
going to change this in a way that

31

00:01:09,299  -->  00:01:11,640
each party members hit points and stuff

32

00:01:11,640  -->  00:01:13,290
are going to be printed at the top of

33

00:01:13,290  -->  00:01:15,810
each turn instead of the bottom. So, what

34

00:01:15,810  -->  00:01:17,610
I'm going to do is at the top of the

35

00:01:17,610  -->  00:01:19,680
script I'm just going to drop a couple lines

36

00:01:19,680  -->  00:01:24,330
here right off the bat, and then we're

37

00:01:24,330  -->  00:01:26,759
going to print out name, hitpoints, and magic

38

00:01:26,759  -->  00:01:30,960
points. So, the top line is going to have

39

00:01:30,960  -->  00:01:36,000
each column's values, so say name let's skip

40

00:01:36,000  -->  00:01:39,420
a bunch of spaces there, hit points, and

41

00:01:39,420  -->  00:01:41,610
then magic points and we will align these up

42

00:01:41,610  -->  00:01:46,619
after. So, we're going to start printing

43

00:01:46,619  -->  00:01:50,670
here the name is going to be a

44

00:01:50,670  -->  00:01:59,070
Valos, and then we're going to...

45

00:01:59,070  -->  00:02:01,530
we can line it up because

46

00:02:01,530  -->  00:02:06,210
we know about you know that these are

47

00:02:06,210  -->  00:02:08,069
fixed width and so they're going to

48

00:02:08,069  -->  00:02:11,100
display the same in the terminal, so

49

00:02:11,150  -->  00:02:13,220
that's good. So, what we're going to do is at

50

00:02:13,220  -->  00:02:16,760
HP here, and actually we're going to create a

51

00:02:16,760  -->  00:02:20,269
first-line first let me go ahead and do

52

00:02:20,269  -->  00:02:22,159
this. Now we're going to skip a bunch of

53

00:02:22,159  -->  00:02:24,409
lines until the hit point, and we're gonna put up a

54

00:02:24,409  -->  00:02:27,379
line of underscores to wrap around the

55

00:02:27,379  -->  00:02:29,390
progress bars,  and I need to make sure this

56

00:02:29,390  -->  00:02:33,530
is 25 characters long. So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

57

00:02:33,530  -->  00:02:46,400
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. And

58

00:02:46,400  -->  00:02:48,470
I am going to do the same for MP,

59

00:02:48,470  -->  00:02:50,810
so the only difference is that is going

60

00:02:50,810  -->  00:02:54,680
to be ten. So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

61

00:02:54,680  -->  00:02:59,359
Now we have skip down

62

00:02:59,359  -->  00:03:02,090
here, and what we're going to do is I'm

63

00:03:02,090  -->  00:03:07,670
going to put a

64

00:03:07,670  -->  00:03:12,349
straight-up line there, it's called a

65

00:03:12,349  -->  00:03:14,689
pipeline actually that right there,

66

00:03:14,689  -->  00:03:22,129
and this is going to be each line so I

67

00:03:22,129  -->  00:03:24,079
can copy this to make three characters.

68

00:03:24,079  -->  00:03:26,750
But, before we do that I'm going to put the

69

00:03:26,750  -->  00:03:31,190
hit point value here first. So, Valos

70

00:03:31,190  -->  00:03:32,419
is going to start out, we're going to

71

00:03:32,419  -->  00:03:37,099
modify this but, 460 hit points so let's put

72

00:03:37,099  -->  00:03:43,699
460/460, one space should be fine. We

73

00:03:43,699  -->  00:03:44,959
can actually move that a couple

74

00:03:44,959  -->  00:03:49,069
characters that way and then reposition the

75

00:03:49,069  -->  00:03:56,030
rest. Same for magic points. We've got 65

76

00:03:56,030  -->  00:03:57,709
of those right now and again we will

77

00:03:57,709  -->  00:04:03,610
rebalance them.

78

00:04:03,610  -->  00:04:08,830
So, if I save this and run it you will see

79

00:04:08,830  -->  00:04:12,220
that I have a line, it shows this we're

80

00:04:12,220  -->  00:04:14,650
going to make it prettier, I can copy

81

00:04:14,650  -->  00:04:19,180
these two lines for each additional

82

00:04:19,180  -->  00:04:24,970
character that we have. Now you'll see

83

00:04:24,970  -->  00:04:26,890
that there's three rows, and I'm going to

84

00:04:26,890  -->  00:04:30,250
actually drop it down another couple lines here to

85

00:04:30,250  -->  00:04:35,620
separate it a bit.

86

00:04:35,620  -->  00:04:37,270
Alright, so, this is what it's gonna show

87

00:04:37,270  -->  00:04:38,830
at the beginning of each turn, so just

88

00:04:38,830  -->  00:04:40,210
above actions here there's going to be

89

00:04:40,210  -->  00:04:43,060
a line break, and then this, and then another

90

00:04:43,060  -->  00:04:46,150
line break, and then an action. We'll actually need to

91

00:04:46,150  -->  00:04:48,640
make the terminal a little bit bigger while we

92

00:04:48,640  -->  00:04:52,930
play it. Now, I thought about how to fill

93

00:04:52,930  -->  00:04:56,169
the progress bars up, I was going to use

94

00:04:56,169  -->  00:04:58,390
equal signs and that didn't really look

95

00:04:58,390  -->  00:05:00,520
right, and I was going to use forward

96

00:05:00,520  -->  00:05:02,470
slashes and that looked a little better and I'll show you

97

00:05:02,470  -->  00:05:05,320
how that looks here.

98

00:05:05,320  -->  00:05:07,480
You can kind of see it looks a bit

99

00:05:07,480  -->  00:05:10,720
more full, and then I decided that neither

100

00:05:10,720  -->  00:05:13,450
of those is going to work. So, I actually

101

00:05:13,450  -->  00:05:16,300
went and found an ascii character, it's this

102

00:05:16,300  -->  00:05:19,510
one right here it's a block. So, it's ASCII

103

00:05:19,510  -->  00:05:23,410
code to 219, so I want you guys to go

104

00:05:23,410  -->  00:05:26,440
ahead and search for ASCII code 219.

105

00:05:26,440  -->  00:05:29,740
For me the first site that comes up is

106

00:05:29,740  -->  00:05:33,160
theasciicode.com, if it's not for you guys I

107

00:05:33,160  -->  00:05:34,600
mean you should be able to get it from

108

00:05:34,600  -->  00:05:38,110
any ascii table at all. I'm just going to

109

00:05:38,110  -->  00:05:39,850
come here, we're going to click on that,

110

00:05:39,850  -->  00:05:45,430
and I'm copy it up here. Going to come back

111

00:05:45,430  -->  00:05:47,620
over to my editor here, we're going to

112

00:05:47,620  -->  00:05:51,040
paste it, and as you can see this looks a

113

00:05:51,040  -->  00:05:54,910
little better.

114

00:05:54,910  -->  00:06:00,250
If I restart this we've now got progress

115

00:06:00,250  -->  00:06:02,860
and it looks a lot better.

116

00:06:02,860  -->  00:06:05,800
The only thing is we need to add some

117

00:06:05,800  -->  00:06:09,730
color formatting here to make it more

118

00:06:09,730  -->  00:06:12,430
visually pleasing and to separate things in

119

00:06:12,430  -->  00:06:14,770
a different way. So, what we're going to do is, and

120

00:06:14,770  -->  00:06:17,440
we're going to be using a lot of

121

00:06:17,440  -->  00:06:19,870
plus-signs and string endings, so

122

00:06:19,870  -->  00:06:23,350
we're going to start off by making

123

00:06:23,350  -->  00:06:30,430
everything bold, and then the name. I'm going

124

00:06:30,430  -->  00:06:37,660
to end it here, plus and drop a line here. For the

125

00:06:37,660  -->  00:06:41,320
hit points were going to say the bcolors.

126

00:06:41,320  -->  00:06:58,390
OKGREEN...

127

00:06:59,830  -->  00:07:05,140
and I'm going to end it right here, start it right up

128

00:07:05,140  -->  00:07:09,880
again, and I'm going to say bcolors.

129

00:07:09,880  -->  00:07:17,170
OKBLUE...it definitely does add a

130

00:07:17,170  -->  00:07:22,030
little bit of complexity to it to the

131

00:07:22,030  -->  00:07:23,920
code here anyway, but you're going to see

132

00:07:23,920  -->  00:07:26,290
the end result looks a lot better.

133

00:07:26,290  -->  00:07:31,870
Now we need to...where did I miss...

134

00:07:31,870  -->  00:07:37,540
forgot the quote right there. Now it should

135

00:07:37,540  -->  00:07:38,590
look a lot better.

136

00:07:38,590  -->  00:07:42,340
There we go. So, as you can see we actually

137

00:07:42,340  -->  00:07:48,880
need to start the color bold again right

138

00:07:48,880  -->  00:07:52,660
there, and goes a bit off-screen so I'm going to

139

00:07:52,660  -->  00:07:58,810
do that. So, now you'll see that we have

140

00:07:58,810  -->  00:08:02,920
three lines with hit points, and

141

00:08:02,920  -->  00:08:06,280
magic points, and for instance this would

142

00:08:06,280  -->  00:08:14,140
actually say like 210/460. Now

143

00:08:14,140  -->  00:08:15,340
another thing we're going to have to do

144

00:08:15,340  -->  00:08:17,320
is account for white space, so if this

145

00:08:17,320  -->  00:08:24,130
only had 10 points out of 460 it's one character

146

00:08:24,130  -->  00:08:25,810
less so everything is shifted this way.

147

00:08:25,810  -->  00:08:27,490
So, we would need to determine how long

148

00:08:27,490  -->  00:08:30,580
that string is and if it's not long

149

00:08:30,580  -->  00:08:33,400
enough we're going to add a space to the

150

00:08:33,400  -->  00:08:34,990
beginning of it when we dynamically

151

00:08:34,990  -->  00:08:37,030
create it. But, for right now we're just

152

00:08:37,030  -->  00:08:39,850
going to

153

00:08:39,850  -->  00:08:42,520
statically create them, and in the next

154

00:08:42,520  -->  00:08:44,200
video what we're going to do is we're

155

00:08:44,200  -->  00:08:46,300
going to bring these into the player

156

00:08:46,300  -->  00:08:50,770
class and we're going to print out each

157

00:08:50,770  -->  00:08:53,140
person so that we can call it in the

158

00:08:53,140  -->  00:08:54,400
main script here at the beginning of

159

00:08:54,400  -->  00:08:57,640
each turn we will instantiate three

160

00:08:57,640  -->  00:09:01,930
players, and then we will say player 0

161

00:09:01,930  -->  00:09:09,000
print stats, player 3 print stats, etc.
