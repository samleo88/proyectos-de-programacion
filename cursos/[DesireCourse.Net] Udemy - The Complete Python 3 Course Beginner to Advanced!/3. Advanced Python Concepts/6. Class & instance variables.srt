00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,149
Alright, so I wanted to talk about the
two different types of variables that

2

00:00:03,149  -->  00:00:06,569
you can set within a class because we've
already set both of them but they both do

3

00:00:06,569  -->  00:00:11,759
very different things. So, an instance
variable is a variable that is different

4

00:00:11,759  -->  00:00:16,320
or can be different for every instance
of the class, so for instance we're

5

00:00:16,320  -->  00:00:22,170
setting "self.atkl" which means this
instance the attack low, but in the

6

00:00:22,170  -->  00:00:29,429
previous set example and what if we want
to set HP of the enemy to let's say 200?

7

00:00:29,429  -->  00:00:35,010
So every enemy is going to have 200 hp.
So let's go ahead and create a function

8

00:00:35,010  -->  00:00:44,579
to get HP "def getHp(self): and let's

9

00:00:45,120  -->  00:00:59,070
"print("Hp is", self.hp)" and here we're going to say "print("atk is", self.atkl)"

10

00:00:59,070  -->  00:01:07,770
So what we can do down here is we can
run "enemy1.get Hp( )" and we will also run

11

00:01:07,770  -->  00:01:17,100
"enemy2.getHp( )" and hit save, and what
we'll see the first enemy has an

12

00:01:17,100  -->  00:01:23,520
attack power of 40 and HP of 200, and the second enemy has attack of 75 and HP of

13

00:01:23,520  -->  00:01:29,549
200 as well because we're setting sort
of a static variable with class.
