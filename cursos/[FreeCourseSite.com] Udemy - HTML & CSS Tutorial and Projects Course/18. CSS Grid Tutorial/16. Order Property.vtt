00:00.270 --> 00:00.840
All right.

00:00.900 --> 00:03.950
Once we have tackled the grid template areas.

00:03.960 --> 00:12.300
Next one up we're going to talk about the order property and it should sound very very familiar because

00:12.360 --> 00:13.050
it is.

00:13.050 --> 00:16.180
We already covered it in the CSX legs box.

00:16.260 --> 00:21.780
So we're going to take a look at it again in the light of CSX grid.

00:21.780 --> 00:27.570
Now first of all what I would like to do is you know what I'm going to set up two columns.

00:27.570 --> 00:33.820
Hundred and hundred like so I am going to get rid of my template areas.

00:34.110 --> 00:38.760
I don't need them and I'm going to delete the cells even though we're going to add them at the very

00:38.760 --> 00:41.820
end anyway and let's save that.

00:41.970 --> 00:50.040
Then of course I do have some kind of issue because I think I deleted it the curly brace ended and we're

00:50.040 --> 00:55.540
back to our setup where we have a three columns as well as the two rows.

00:55.710 --> 01:03.990
So each and every item within our container so within our grid parent container each and every child

01:03.990 --> 01:07.080
item more a cell has the order of 0.

01:07.650 --> 01:14.100
So if we're going to change that order well we could either replace it at the end or in the beginning

01:14.460 --> 01:17.460
or a few of them how it actually in between.

01:17.460 --> 01:23.440
So I guess first let's try it out with cell number 1 and let's change that property.

01:23.610 --> 01:27.220
And by the way I do need to place it within the style.

01:27.540 --> 01:29.120
Otherwise I'm going to have the error.

01:29.280 --> 01:34.590
So let's select mortar and let's say or is going to be what.

01:35.190 --> 01:37.590
Well let's say order number two.

01:37.620 --> 01:39.600
Now what do you think is going to happen.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.610
Let's save it.

01:40.680 --> 01:45.120
And now my cell number one is sitting all the way at the end.

01:45.120 --> 01:49.500
Now the reason why it's sitting all the way in the end because the rest of them have the order of zero

01:49.920 --> 01:50.660
correct.

01:50.670 --> 01:56.170
So if we have a positive order we just place it at the end of the pack.

01:56.190 --> 02:02.280
Now if I would like to place the cell number six at the very beginning what I would need to do I need

02:02.280 --> 02:05.310
to set up my order to a negative value.

02:05.310 --> 02:08.550
So let's set up a cell number one.

02:08.610 --> 02:10.380
I'm sorry not cell number one.

02:10.620 --> 02:13.080
Truly let's set cell number six.

02:13.090 --> 02:20.240
That's what I was saying to a negative 1 and now I placed it in the center like I said I can always

02:20.240 --> 02:23.990
place it in between if I have some kind of values.

02:24.200 --> 02:30.260
So let's say I'm going to add four cell number to some kind of value.

02:30.530 --> 02:36.330
So since I am using let's say 2 I'm going to add like 4.

02:36.340 --> 02:39.800
OK so let's go the cell number.

02:39.830 --> 02:42.560
I said or you know what let's do three.

02:42.560 --> 02:50.150
Let's play cell number three is going to have the order value of four like so.

02:50.210 --> 02:57.200
So now I have cell number 1 and then cell number 3 is at the very end of the pack because order is the

02:57.200 --> 02:58.350
most positive.

02:58.490 --> 03:01.950
And now I'd like to place let's say cell number five in between them.

03:01.980 --> 03:03.510
Now how do I do that.

03:03.530 --> 03:05.020
I have 2 and 4.

03:05.090 --> 03:13.100
So we can just shockingly head over to a cell number five very easy.

03:13.120 --> 03:18.620
What's the order of three is that is in between two and four separate.

03:18.630 --> 03:24.930
And now I have cell number six as a first one because it has negative 1 and then I just rearranged the

03:24.930 --> 03:26.070
order a little bit.

03:26.070 --> 03:26.560
OK.

03:26.700 --> 03:29.940
Using the order of two three and four.

03:30.020 --> 03:34.680
And that's how we can use order properly when we're working with C says grid.
