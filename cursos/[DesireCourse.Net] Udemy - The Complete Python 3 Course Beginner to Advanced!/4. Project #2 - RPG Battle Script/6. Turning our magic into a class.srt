1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,700
Alright, so, we've got a magic system and

2

00:00:02,700  -->  00:00:04,980
it works but it's not ideal and that's

3

00:00:04,980  -->  00:00:07,770
simply because it's taking up space in

4

00:00:07,770  -->  00:00:10,230
our main Python file here, and in order to

5

00:00:10,230  -->  00:00:11,580
get that out of there what we're going

6

00:00:11,580  -->  00:00:14,130
to do is we're just going to create as

7

00:00:14,130  -->  00:00:18,480
with our game.py classes here, we're

8

00:00:18,480  -->  00:00:21,810
going to create a new file in the

9

00:00:21,810  -->  00:00:24,689
classes directories, it's to be a python file,

10

00:00:24,689  -->  00:00:29,880
and we're going to call it magic. Now in

11

00:00:29,880  -->  00:00:31,320
here we're going to create a class

12

00:00:31,320  -->  00:00:36,570
called Spell, and what we're going to

13

00:00:36,570  -->  00:00:38,940
have, if we look over at our main python file, we're

14

00:00:38,940  -->  00:00:41,309
going to have name, cost, damage, we're

15

00:00:41,309  -->  00:00:43,020
also gonna have type and I'm going to show you

16

00:00:43,020  -->  00:00:45,329
guys why. So let's go ahead and create

17

00:00:45,329  -->  00:00:48,450
our init function, and we're going to

18

00:00:48,450  -->  00:00:59,969
take in name, cost, prop, and type.

19

00:00:59,969  -->  00:01:03,210
Actually, let's name this damage, and I will

20

00:01:03,210  -->  00:01:04,650
show you guys why we're doing this in a

21

00:01:04,650  -->  00:01:06,420
second. What we're going to do is we're

22

00:01:06,420  -->  00:01:08,159
going to create instance variables

23

00:01:08,159  -->  00:01:10,380
from the variables or from the

24

00:01:10,380  -->  00:01:28,049
values that we pass in. So, name = name, self.cost = cost, and

25

00:01:28,049  -->  00:01:31,740
self.type = type. So, we're just doing very

26

00:01:31,740  -->  00:01:35,490
basic stuff here. Just to recap, when you say self

27

00:01:35,490  -->  00:01:38,400
you mean this instance of the class. So, if we

28

00:01:38,400  -->  00:01:43,439
instantiate, and let's look back here just to  recap, we're instantiating the person class

29

00:01:43,439  -->  00:01:47,939
twice. This instance of the person class

30

00:01:47,939  -->  00:01:51,390
goes into player, and this instance goes

31

00:01:51,390  -->  00:01:54,390
into enemy. And as you can see the values

32

00:01:54,390  -->  00:01:56,850
and variables here are different, and we're

33

00:01:56,850  -->  00:02:00,149
able to access different variables. If we

34

00:02:00,149  -->  00:02:02,340
say enemy.HP it's going to turn out

35

00:02:02,340  -->  00:02:05,790
this. If we say player.HP it's going to say that, and that's

36

00:02:05,790  -->  00:02:09,030
because in here we set HP equal to whatever

37

00:02:09,030  -->  00:02:10,110
we pass in

38

00:02:10,110  -->  00:02:14,190
there. Which it's not a difficult concept,

39

00:02:14,190  -->  00:02:15,630
I think you guys remember, I just wanted

40

00:02:15,630  -->  00:02:18,840
to you know go over that again just in

41

00:02:18,840  -->  00:02:20,640
case as we're, that's something we're

42

00:02:20,640  -->  00:02:23,790
doing right here. So, we have our spell

43

00:02:23,790  -->  00:02:25,620
created and we don't really need to do

44

00:02:25,620  -->  00:02:31,860
anything except, we have generate spell

45

00:02:31,860  -->  00:02:41,010
damage there, I think...

46

00:02:41,010  -->  00:02:43,770
We don't need that function, I'll show

47

00:02:43,770  -->  00:02:46,590
you guys why. We don't need spell name, I'll  show

48

00:02:46,590  -->  00:02:48,000
you guys why. So, I'm going to delete these,

49

00:02:48,000  -->  00:03:04,650
and remove the heal, actually no

50

00:03:04,650  -->  00:03:06,239
we're going to keep that one because

51

00:03:06,239  -->  00:03:10,020
that is more player based than spell based.

52

00:03:10,020  -->  00:03:13,890
And the spell damage we're going to

53

00:03:13,890  -->  00:03:19,440
remove that as well. Alright,

54

00:03:19,440  -->  00:03:21,060
let's go ahead and save this. Now that's

55

00:03:21,060  -->  00:03:23,489
going to break our game here if we try

56

00:03:23,489  -->  00:03:27,780
to play it again and we choose a spell.

57

00:03:27,780  -->  00:03:32,519
It's going to have a dangerous effect because

58

00:03:32,519  -->  00:03:35,760
we've just removed some essential code.

59

00:03:35,760  -->  00:03:37,799
So what we're going to do is we're going to

60

00:03:37,799  -->  00:03:41,820
fix this up by instantiating multiple

61

00:03:41,820  -->  00:03:43,470
spells and we're going to reference them by

62

00:03:43,470  -->  00:03:44,970
name.

63

00:03:44,970  -->  00:03:55,200
Fire is going to equal spell...fire cost,

64

00:03:55,200  -->  00:03:59,489
what order did I pass that in? Name, cost, damage, and

65

00:03:59,489  -->  00:04:03,480
type. So, the cost is going to be 10,

66

00:04:03,480  -->  00:04:07,140
the damage is going to be a 100, and

67

00:04:07,140  -->  00:04:11,430
the type is going to be black magic.

68

00:04:11,430  -->  00:04:13,980
Now as you can see this underlined

69

00:04:13,980  -->  00:04:18,750
because we didn't import magic yet. So,

70

00:04:18,750  -->  00:04:19,510
from

71

00:04:19,510  -->  00:04:23,320
classes.magic import spell.

72

00:04:23,320  -->  00:04:28,510
We're going to do the same thing with

73

00:04:28,510  -->  00:04:33,880
thunder and blizzard as well, I'm also going to throw in

74

00:04:33,880  -->  00:04:39,010
meteor, quake, and that's good for now. So,

75

00:04:39,010  -->  00:05:03,590
thunder, blizzard, meteor, and quake.

76

00:05:03,590  -->  00:05:07,070
They all do the same level of damage and

77

00:05:07,070  -->  00:05:08,720
we're going to fix that a moment, I'm

78

00:05:08,720  -->  00:05:14,330
just going to add a comment here, okay

79

00:05:14,330  -->  00:05:16,550
black magic and now we're going to

80

00:05:16,550  -->  00:05:18,320
balance this. So, meteor is going

81

00:05:18,320  -->  00:05:20,690
to be about double the cost and double

82

00:05:20,690  -->  00:05:23,780
the damage, quake is going to be about

83

00:05:23,780  -->  00:05:30,740
.2 higher than both fire and thunder in both

84

00:05:30,740  -->  00:05:36,380
MP costs, well .4. So, it's going to cost 14

85

00:05:36,380  -->  00:05:37,850
and going to do 140 damage.

86

00:05:37,850  -->  00:05:41,270
Now I'm going to create some white magic.

87

00:05:41,270  -->  00:05:49,190
So we're going to create cure, I'm just going

88

00:05:49,190  -->  00:05:51,320
to copy these, well I will print them out. So, cure

89

00:05:51,320  -->  00:05:58,790
equals spell, the name is cure, the cost is

90

00:05:58,790  -->  00:06:00,200
going to be, well let's look at a few

91

00:06:00,200  -->  00:06:03,650
things first. So, the person has 400 points hit points, so

92

00:06:03,650  -->  00:06:08,420
I think 120 is a decent amount here. So

93

00:06:08,420  -->  00:06:14,510
the cost is going to be 12, and the damage is going to be that, and

94

00:06:14,510  -->  00:06:16,010
we're going to say it's white magic.

95

00:06:16,010  -->  00:06:17,930
We're going to create a more powerful

96

00:06:17,930  -->  00:06:22,700
cure spell called cura, and that we're

97

00:06:22,700  -->  00:06:28,250
taking from Final Fantasy. So it will

98

00:06:28,250  -->  00:06:30,320
cost about 18 but it's actually

99

00:06:30,320  -->  00:06:33,920
going to feel for 20, and we're going to classify that as

100

00:06:33,920  -->  00:06:36,350
white magic as well. Now what we're going to

101

00:06:36,350  -->  00:06:38,540
do is we don't want the player, well the

102

00:06:38,540  -->  00:06:40,250
enemy can't use magic right now we're

103

00:06:40,250  -->  00:06:41,930
going to fix that I think in the next

104

00:06:41,930  -->  00:06:43,850
video, right now what we're just going to

105

00:06:43,850  -->  00:06:49,520
do is create player magic. And then we're

106

00:06:49,520  -->  00:06:51,500
just going to pass you the variables

107

00:06:51,500  -->  00:06:54,080
that we created up here as magic for

108

00:06:54,080  -->  00:06:56,510
whichever spells we want to...actually you

109

00:06:56,510  -->  00:06:58,490
know what we're gonna move that all

110

00:06:58,490  -->  00:06:59,510
together, we're just going to do it

111

00:06:59,510  -->  00:07:05,960
straight in line.

112

00:07:05,960  -->  00:07:08,150
And so we're going to create a list here,

113

00:07:08,150  -->  00:07:10,729
and spells we want we're going to say

114

00:07:10,729  -->  00:07:15,979
fire, thunder, blizzard, of course the

115

00:07:15,979  -->  00:07:27,289
basic ones, then meteor, and cure, and cura. And

116

00:07:27,289  -->  00:07:30,740
they're going to have no magic for right

117

00:07:30,740  -->  00:07:34,880
now. So, if I save this we still need to

118

00:07:34,880  -->  00:07:38,750
modify a few things. I believe we took

119

00:07:38,750  -->  00:07:42,229
out generate spell damage in the player, so

120

00:07:42,229  -->  00:07:44,690
what we need to do is add that into the

121

00:07:44,690  -->  00:07:58,400
class here. So, I'm just going to say generate damage, and

122

00:07:58,400  -->  00:08:01,130
what we're going to do is thing as

123

00:08:01,130  -->  00:08:04,159
before, we're going to set low equals

124

00:08:04,159  -->  00:08:12,050
self.damage - 15, and high is going

125

00:08:12,050  -->  00:08:18,650
to be self.damage + 15. I believe

126

00:08:18,650  -->  00:08:23,000
we used the random in the generate

127

00:08:23,000  -->  00:08:26,570
damage, we have random randrange. So what

128

00:08:26,570  -->  00:08:28,669
we're going to do, and this is as you

129

00:08:28,669  -->  00:08:31,370
remember the randrange here generates a

130

00:08:31,370  -->  00:08:34,339
number between a low and a high number or

131

00:08:34,339  -->  00:08:35,779
guess you can use high and low as well,

132

00:08:35,779  -->  00:08:37,130
it doesn't really matter what order you

133

00:08:37,130  -->  00:08:39,620
pass in, so we need to import random.

134

00:08:39,620  -->  00:08:42,919
Let's go ahead and do magic, let's drop down a few

135

00:08:42,919  -->  00:08:47,630
lines, and run import random, and then

136

00:08:47,630  -->  00:08:50,329
we're going to return random.randrange,

137

00:08:50,329  -->  00:08:53,480
and we're going to pass in low

138

00:08:53,480  -->  00:09:00,140
and high. So let's save this now, go

139

00:09:00,140  -->  00:09:03,950
back over here, and we need to fix the

140

00:09:03,950  -->  00:09:07,760
generate spell damage. So, what we're

141

00:09:07,760  -->  00:09:11,329
going to do is, this is awesome, so as you

142

00:09:11,329  -->  00:09:13,339
can see we passed our index number here

143

00:09:13,339  -->  00:09:16,100
into an actual function, and what we're

144

00:09:16,100  -->  00:09:17,600
going to do now, we're going to do the

145

00:09:17,600  -->  00:09:19,500
opposite actually, we're going to

146

00:09:19,500  -->  00:09:22,260
say, so this is going to be entirely

147

00:09:22,260  -->  00:09:23,730
different, so I'm going to drop some

148

00:09:23,730  -->  00:09:25,530
lines here and I'm going to rewrite the code

149

00:09:25,530  -->  00:09:28,140
in the new way so you guys can see the

150

00:09:28,140  -->  00:09:32,340
difference. So magic damage is going to be

151

00:09:32,340  -->  00:09:33,720
equal to

152

00:09:33,720  -->  00:09:43,560
player.magic, and we're going to

153

00:09:43,560  -->  00:09:48,810
say the magic choice, and then we're

154

00:09:48,810  -->  00:09:52,080
going to target the magic's function which

155

00:09:52,080  -->  00:09:58,920
is generate damage. And then we're going

156

00:09:58,920  -->  00:10:02,250
to see the spells name,

157

00:10:02,250  -->  00:10:04,830
well what we can do is actually a little

158

00:10:04,830  -->  00:10:11,310
bit easier. We're going to set spell, it's going to be equal

159

00:10:11,310  -->  00:10:15,990
to player.magic, magic choice,

160

00:10:15,990  -->  00:10:19,140
and so this is going to be the spell

161

00:10:19,140  -->  00:10:20,820
itself. And so what we can do is we can

162

00:10:20,820  -->  00:10:22,800
remove a lot of this, simplify this to

163

00:10:22,800  -->  00:10:27,660
say spell.generate_damage, and then cost is

164

00:10:27,660  -->  00:10:33,210
going to be spell cost. Actually, we forgot the

165

00:10:33,210  -->  00:10:34,950
equal sign there, we don't even need to

166

00:10:34,950  -->  00:10:37,020
do that because it's so short. What we can

167

00:10:37,020  -->  00:10:44,280
do...alright. What we're going to do

168

00:10:44,280  -->  00:10:47,400
down here is spell is set there, but we need

169

00:10:47,400  -->  00:10:51,960
to target spell.name, and magic

170

00:10:51,960  -->  00:10:53,880
damage there is a number

171

00:10:53,880  -->  00:10:56,640
already, and that's all we need to do.

172

00:10:56,640  -->  00:10:59,820
Actually, right here we need to say if

173

00:10:59,820  -->  00:11:03,000
spell cost is more than current MP

174

00:11:03,000  -->  00:11:06,810
than it fails. So I think we're good to go, I

175

00:11:06,810  -->  00:11:08,730
think I did everything necessary, so I

176

00:11:08,730  -->  00:11:12,150
can remove these old lines of code here,

177

00:11:12,150  -->  00:11:15,930
I can save this, and let's try this again.

178

00:11:15,930  -->  00:11:18,750
Oh, no, we're not gonna be able to choose

179

00:11:18,750  -->  00:11:21,960
our magic because that's stored in player, so

180

00:11:21,960  -->  00:11:23,760
we're going to have to put that...actually

181

00:11:23,760  -->  00:11:26,100
we can't do that what we need to do is,

182

00:11:26,100  -->  00:11:30,190
where's our game class?

183

00:11:30,190  -->  00:11:32,350
Self magic is being set to what we set in

184

00:11:32,350  -->  00:11:39,550
there, and then choose magic is now

185

00:11:39,550  -->  00:11:42,340
that will work. Ok, so, we're going to list our

186

00:11:42,340  -->  00:11:43,030
magic,

187

00:11:43,030  -->  00:11:57,600
ok it's not gonna work and the reason is...

188

00:11:57,600  -->  00:12:04,589
let's try that use an instance variable. Spell

189

00:12:04,589  -->  00:12:09,120
object is not scriptable. So, let's go ahead

190

00:12:09,120  -->  00:12:22,680
and import from .magic import Spell.

191

00:12:31,290  -->  00:12:34,170
So, let's go ahead and look back at this.

192

00:12:34,170  -->  00:12:40,740
Alright, in here

193

00:12:40,740  -->  00:12:43,139
what I'm going to do what it says choose

194

00:12:43,139  -->  00:13:03,950
magic I'm just going to print...

195

00:13:03,950  -->  00:13:09,140
this is pretty print by the way, we are going

196

00:13:09,140  -->  00:13:16,430
to pprint(self.magic), and as you can see

197

00:13:16,430  -->  00:13:20,270
I've been working a lot in C++. Alright, let's go

198

00:13:20,270  -->  00:13:37,630
ahead and rerun this and have a look...

199

00:13:37,630  -->  00:13:40,070
ok.

200

00:13:42,380  -->  00:13:45,530
So, we're able to print self magic, so

201

00:13:45,530  -->  00:13:54,560
for i in self.magic:

202

00:13:54,560  -->  00:14:02,110
print(i)

203

00:14:02,110  -->  00:14:08,470
So it prints out each object correctly. I

204

00:14:08,470  -->  00:14:10,899
should be able to target the name of

205

00:14:10,899  -->  00:14:16,810
each one, and I can. So, it could be this

206

00:14:16,810  -->  00:14:20,170
right here that is causing the problem because I can't

207

00:14:20,170  -->  00:14:22,810
see anything else that would cause the

208

00:14:22,810  -->  00:14:27,370
problems. So, let's remove this, save this,

209

00:14:27,370  -->  00:14:31,630
rerun this, let's choose magic, and there we go.

210

00:14:31,630  -->  00:14:39,070
We've finally got our magic working. I was looking for the problem like

211

00:14:39,070  -->  00:14:40,360
there is not a problem here, but it's

212

00:14:40,360  -->  00:14:42,279
just I was targeting that in the way that

213

00:14:42,279  -->  00:14:44,470
you target a list and an index, rather

214

00:14:44,470  -->  00:14:46,360
than how you target an object and an object

215

00:14:46,360  -->  00:14:52,930
attribute, class attribute. So, that allows us to choose

216

00:14:52,930  -->  00:14:56,470
our magic. We should be able here to say

217

00:14:56,470  -->  00:15:02,440
we're going to choose fire, and reduce MP is not defined because cost is not defined,

218

00:15:02,440  -->  00:15:07,720
so I missed something. Reduce MP is going

219

00:15:07,720  -->  00:15:15,459
to be spell.cost, there we go. Let's try meteor,

220

00:15:16,810  -->  00:15:20,589
meteor deals 211 damage. So, again we're

221

00:15:20,589  -->  00:15:24,010
going to go with fire, and we're doing some

222

00:15:24,010  -->  00:15:28,209
good damage here,, now we're losing so we

223

00:15:28,209  -->  00:15:32,199
need to heal. So, we need to build in the

224

00:15:32,199  -->  00:15:34,570
heal functionality, and we'll save that for

225

00:15:34,570  -->  00:15:37,329
the next video, actually. I think we've done enough right now so in the next video

226

00:15:37,329  -->  00:15:39,040
we're going to be focusing on creating a

227

00:15:39,040  -->  00:15:45,329
heal function.
