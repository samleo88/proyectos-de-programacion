00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,899
Hey guys, welcome back. In this section of videos, or this subsection because we're

2

00:00:03,899  -->  00:00:09,750
still on section 5, this will be 5.3 I
guess, we're going to be covering a

3

00:00:09,750  -->  00:00:18,660
package called PyMongo and what it is
a Python binding for the program

4

00:00:18,660  -->  00:00:25,140
Mongo or MongoDB. So if you don't know what Mongo is or MongoDB you're probably

5

00:00:25,140  -->  00:00:29,519
going to love it, and if you do know
what it is you probably already love it,

6

00:00:29,519  -->  00:00:35,520
so let's get into it. For those of you
who don't know let me bring up a browser

7

00:00:35,520  -->  00:00:50,160
here. and let's go to "mongodb" So, MongoDB is a NoSQL database driver, so if you've

8

00:00:50,160  -->  00:00:55,350
done any work in PHP you've probably
used my MySQL, and that's I mean it's

9

00:00:55,350  -->  00:01:00,840
just it's a relational database that has
to have a certain structure, so each

10

00:01:00,840  -->  00:01:04,589
table needs to have a certain amount of
columns, and then when you insert data

11

00:01:04,589  -->  00:01:11,250
you need to like if information isn't
sent in for a specific column the column

12

00:01:11,250  -->  00:01:15,720
still exists it's just blank, and so you
have to follow the same structure, but

13

00:01:15,720  -->  00:01:20,729
with MongoDB you can really you don't
have that limitation so it's a bit

14

00:01:20,729  -->  00:01:24,000
different in that regard. If you guys
don't have it you're going to need to

15

00:01:24,000  -->  00:01:27,000
install MongoDB on your computer.

16

00:01:27,000  -->  00:01:37,860
With Windows you should be able to
just come to the site and open-source

17

00:01:37,860  -->  00:01:43,799
I believe download, alright there is a
great big button right there.

18

00:01:44,430  -->  00:01:52,500
Alright, so, you can get it for free
with different platforms, the

19

00:01:52,500  -->  00:01:57,149
installation is going to be a bit
different for each one. If you're using

20

00:01:57,149  -->  00:02:02,369
Linux you should be able to go through
your package manager and install it by

21

00:02:02,369  -->  00:02:07,649
default, so if you you know you can
install it through yum, I believe you can

22

00:02:07,649  -->  00:02:12,000
install it with apt-get as well. With OS 10
we're going to be installing with

23

00:02:12,000  -->  00:02:12,870
homebrew,

24

00:02:12,870  -->  00:02:16,290
so I'm not gonna be downloading this. On
Windows you are going to be downloading

25

00:02:16,290  -->  00:02:20,310
the installer and you're gonna be
running that. So, I've already got this,

26

00:02:21,000  -->  00:02:24,330
so you need to install two things to use
with Python, you need to install

27

00:02:24,330  -->  00:02:29,370
MongoDB itself and then you need to
install the Mongo bindings for

28

00:02:29,370  -->  00:02:35,849
Python. So to install MongoDB on OS 10
basically we're going to using homebrew

29

00:02:35,849  -->  00:02:42,599
again, so jump in the terminal type "brew
install mongodb" is it or mongod?

30

00:02:42,599  -->  00:02:49,560
It is one of the two sometimes they use
different package names specifically.

31

00:02:49,560  -->  00:02:54,060
Alright, so it is MongoDB and I already
have it installed so I'm going to get this

32

00:02:54,060  -->  00:02:55,019
message.

33

00:02:55,019  -->  00:03:00,510
You guys probably don't or if you do
awesome. Once you get MongoDB installed

34

00:03:00,510  -->  00:03:10,109
you need to start it, so go ahead run
"brew services start mongodb" and

35

00:03:10,109  -->  00:03:16,799
mine is already started I guess it's
configured to start on boot, so that's

36

00:03:16,799  -->  00:03:17,340
awesome.

37

00:03:17,340  -->  00:03:22,109
Now once you've got all this setup you
have Mongo installed you should be able

38

00:03:22,109  -->  00:03:32,099
to type "curl http://localhost27017" So if you get

39

00:03:32,099  -->  00:03:36,989
this message it means that MongoDB is
setup and configured properly. If you

40

00:03:36,989  -->  00:03:41,099
have any other issues I could try to
help you out but not doing this course

41

00:03:41,099  -->  00:03:44,459
specifically on MongoDB, but I will do my
best

42

00:03:44,459  -->  00:03:48,540
you should also be able to find support
on the documentation they should also

43

00:03:48,540  -->  00:03:50,459
have a support page on the website as well.

44

00:03:50,459  -->  00:03:55,290
Now once you do have Mongo setup you
need to install a Python package called

45

00:03:55,290  -->  00:04:03,750
PyMongo. So go ahead run "pip3 install pymongo" and now I don't have

46

00:04:03,750  -->  00:04:09,389
it installed yet and that's how quick it
is to install, so just grab the, grab the

47

00:04:09,389  -->  00:04:15,060
file, have it installed, and now we're
good to go. So I'm going to clear this.

48

00:04:15,060  -->  00:04:21,030
Now if I open back up the browser you
should just be able to Google "pymongo"

49

00:04:21,030  -->  00:04:23,670
and it should

50

00:04:23,670  -->  00:04:28,740
here we go that's the API. Here's a
tutorial database API documentation,

51

00:04:28,740  -->  00:04:34,530
alright. So here's some documentation
this should be a full referenced so if

52

00:04:34,530  -->  00:04:40,950
you need any help with Mongo or
PyMongo you should be able to get the

53

00:04:40,950  -->  00:04:47,820
help here. So, MongDB's official
website api.mongodb.com/python/current/api

54

00:04:47,820  -->  00:04:56,850
Alright, now let's jump into a Python shell, so "python3" and

55

00:04:56,850  -->  00:04:57,960
we're good to go.

56

00:04:57,960  -->  00:05:01,320
First thing we need to do obviously
we're going to need to "import pymongo"

57

00:05:01,320  -->  00:05:03,660
just like that, it's that simple,

58

00:05:03,660  -->  00:05:10,440
and then let's go ahead and run a Mongo
client. So what we need to do is now

59

00:05:10,440  -->  00:05:13,260
import "MongoClient( )" I believe.

60

00:05:13,260  -->  00:05:18,480
Let's check this out if it's not already
installed, alright it's not defined. So

61

00:05:18,480  -->  00:05:30,180
what we need to do is "from pymongo
import MongoClient" and it's camelcase.

62

00:05:30,180  -->  00:05:38,700
Once you get Mongo client imported you
now need to actually instantiate the Mongo

63

00:05:38,700  -->  00:05:45,330
client, so basically it's really simple
to instantiate it. Create a variable

64

00:05:45,330  -->  00:05:53,490
called "client = MongoClient( )" and
its class, and we just created an object

65

00:05:53,490  -->  00:05:59,190
from that. Now alternatively this is
going to connect on the default host and

66

00:05:59,190  -->  00:06:10,560
port which means writing that is
essentially the same as writing this. So

67

00:06:10,560  -->  00:06:16,020
if you have it set up to run on a
different port or a different host, you

68

00:06:16,020  -->  00:06:19,800
will be able to connect like this, change
the port or the house

69

00:06:19,800  -->  00:06:26,880
accordingly. Now, additionally, you can use a mongo URL. So what a mongo URL is, is a

70

00:06:26,880  -->  00:06:33,270
specific URL that Mongo can use to
connect to a machine. So how you are gonna do

71

00:06:33,270  -->  00:06:36,100
that is rather than using HTTP which are

72

00:06:36,100  -->  00:06:40,450
common protocols you now have
access to a new protocol called

73

00:06:40,450  -->  00:06:53,350
"('mongodb://localhost:27017/')" So no matter

74

00:06:53,350  -->  00:06:57,010
which one of these ways you get
connected, the idea should be that

75

00:06:57,010  -->  00:07:03,490
you are connected to the Mongo service
which means that you are now able to

76

00:07:03,490  -->  00:07:08,710
connect to a database. So we're going to
connect to a database and we're going to

77

00:07:08,710  -->  00:07:12,310
be ending the video there and then we'll
continue in the next video. So to get

78

00:07:12,310  -->  00:07:16,960
connected to a database, i'm not sure if
we actually need one set up first or if

79

00:07:16,960  -->  00:07:21,190
it will create on the fly here, so let's
go ahead and try. We're going to set "db =

80

00:07:21,190  -->  00:07:30,850
client." whatever database we want. So,
let's say it's going to be called

81

00:07:30,850  -->  00:07:39,610
".pytests" and that's how to create a
collection, nothing

82

00:07:39,610  -->  00:07:43,630
the collection doesn't exist yet because
we haven't or the database doesn't exsist

83

00:07:43,630  -->  00:07:46,780
yet because we haven't put anything into
it, and so that's what we're going to be

84

00:07:46,780  -->  00:07:50,710
going over the next video. We're going to
be going over the collection or what a

85

00:07:50,710  -->  00:07:54,880
table is in Mongo, and how to set one up.
