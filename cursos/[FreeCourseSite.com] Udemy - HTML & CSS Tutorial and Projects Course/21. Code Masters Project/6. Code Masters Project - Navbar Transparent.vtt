WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:05.400
And the way we set the bar responsive we would need to use a media screen.

00:05.550 --> 00:09.960
So I'm going to go all the way over here at the bottom and we're going to say this is going to be my

00:09.960 --> 00:15.420
year and we're going to say screen or here or here we're going to say and I don't know we're here we're

00:15.420 --> 00:17.320
going to send men with.

00:17.420 --> 00:17.950
Right.

00:18.030 --> 00:22.040
And the men with we're going to set it to nine hundred and ninety two pixels.

00:22.040 --> 00:22.460
Right.

00:22.570 --> 00:26.850
So in the moment the screen is going to be 992 and something should happen.

00:27.840 --> 00:31.210
And we're here just to show you what we have.

00:31.270 --> 00:36.030
We're going to go back over here and consider that this is what we have right so if you are fresh here

00:36.600 --> 00:38.560
we can toggle it over here right.

00:38.770 --> 00:40.470
You can see that it's spanning all across.

00:40.470 --> 00:40.780
Right.

00:40.830 --> 00:43.940
And all the time it doesn't matter how big a screen right.

00:43.950 --> 00:46.330
This looks like this over here like this right.

00:46.500 --> 00:52.290
So what would want to do here first and we're going to say is we would want to get rid of this button

00:52.950 --> 00:53.250
here.

00:53.260 --> 00:53.870
Right.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.710
So we're going to get rid of this button.

00:55.890 --> 00:59.930
And the way we're going to do that we're going to say we're hearing this is going to be for the.

01:00.420 --> 01:05.060
We're going to say that this is going to be a display here this play.

01:05.270 --> 01:07.180
I'm not going to say none here.

01:07.180 --> 01:07.740
Right.

01:07.910 --> 01:15.040
And once we refresh you can see that once I get past nine I need to write the button disappears.

01:15.040 --> 01:20.320
Now there's one thing that I need to add and this is going to be linear gradient for a image right because

01:20.320 --> 01:22.380
you can see that image is very bright.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.000
Right.

01:23.050 --> 01:26.160
So what we're going to do over here is going to do a little detour.

01:26.200 --> 01:33.130
We're going to go to the header and before the you are out we're going to have a linear gradient.

01:34.590 --> 01:41.010
And this is all going to use for background so I'm going to say R.G. be here and that's going to be

01:41.400 --> 01:42.470
dark color.

01:42.720 --> 01:51.700
So we're going to say we're here and this is going to be 0 0 0 0 0 0 point 4.

01:52.110 --> 01:57.520
Again R G B R G B L here R G B.

01:57.690 --> 02:04.110
And here again this is going to be 0 0 0 0 point 4 0 here.

02:04.190 --> 02:05.950
And then we need to place a comma here.

02:05.970 --> 02:06.600
Right.

02:06.600 --> 02:13.480
So what we're saying is even though the image is there right we would want this dark overlay or you're

02:13.500 --> 02:13.820
right.

02:13.860 --> 02:19.010
So I just forgot to do this before so that's why we're adding right now.

02:19.290 --> 02:25.920
So once we got rid of the button we're here now would want to work with the nav right here with the

02:25.930 --> 02:27.210
nav I'm going to say like this.

02:27.210 --> 02:27.500
Right.

02:27.520 --> 02:32.240
I'm going to say display flex like this and we're going to go back.

02:32.290 --> 02:33.360
All right.

02:33.630 --> 02:36.360
Once we have nine 992 two you can see what happens right.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.450
So this is going to be our display flaks.

02:38.530 --> 02:38.790
Right.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.480
So this is how it's going to look like.

02:40.710 --> 02:46.350
And you can see that I can get back my links right because obviously they have disappeared because I

02:46.350 --> 02:47.530
have no toggle button.

02:47.530 --> 02:55.650
All right then once we have them on display for the next one we would want is flex right up here and

02:55.770 --> 03:01.590
we're going to say wrap or here flex Arap right.

03:01.650 --> 03:07.650
And this is going to be equal to wrap because once there's going to be actually more content we would

03:07.650 --> 03:13.410
want it to wrap as we're going to the smaller screen on here and we're going to have a justified content

03:13.410 --> 03:16.350
space around space around.

03:16.410 --> 03:16.890
Right.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.530
And again for now the links are disappearing.

03:19.530 --> 03:25.600
We haven't added back the wings were here and we'll have enough contained container.

03:25.600 --> 03:31.130
All right so this is going to be this guy over here and I'm bringing a screen container like this.

03:31.460 --> 03:33.290
And then we'll have a background.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.640
Transparent.

03:36.520 --> 03:43.890
Hear more bottom right we want to get rid of this mortar and if we're fresh then we would want to get

03:43.890 --> 03:46.500
rid of this guy doing this.

03:46.590 --> 03:55.280
And for that we're going to say we're here and this is going to be a border bottom none border bottom

03:55.610 --> 03:58.070
and we're going to stay on here and on and on.

03:58.070 --> 04:07.460
We need to do is place a semi going on here and maybe let's create more space here and not know of none

04:07.850 --> 04:08.180
here.

04:08.210 --> 04:09.550
Border border none.

04:09.590 --> 04:10.800
And then I'm glad.

04:11.060 --> 04:17.760
As for the child going on a flex property line because this container is going to be the child of the

04:17.780 --> 04:20.290
now here we're going to ride flex.

04:20.350 --> 04:23.340
Going to say 0 0 0 0 right now.

04:23.390 --> 04:27.710
Our issue right now is that we don't see it and we don't see our links.

04:27.710 --> 04:28.100
All right.

04:28.140 --> 04:30.460
So here you can see there we added everything right.

04:30.620 --> 04:34.310
But there's only one thing right there is no links whatsoever.

04:34.310 --> 04:41.000
And what we would want to do here is we would want to create a nav link so we're going to have links

04:41.290 --> 04:41.590
here.

04:41.620 --> 04:44.300
Remember we had them as this plane known right.

04:44.370 --> 04:49.910
But over here we do want to have this play and we're going to say flex more here.

04:49.970 --> 04:52.910
And also we need to write important or like this.

04:52.910 --> 04:53.320
Right.

04:53.470 --> 04:55.970
So we need to have a important door here right.

04:56.060 --> 04:57.400
And now we have our legs.

04:57.470 --> 04:59.970
And the reason for that is one important one right.

05:00.170 --> 05:03.440
Because if you're going to be safe we're going to get rid of important.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.030
Right.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.880
So let's get rid of this important one order here.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.350
All right let's save this.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.810
And we are fresh right.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.430
So on the smaller screen you can get a link back.

05:13.430 --> 05:15.260
Right now everything is working fine.

05:15.260 --> 05:16.510
Everything is nice right.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.170
Go to the bigger screen right.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.550
They are working on here right.

05:19.700 --> 05:21.670
You can see or hear the display.

05:21.800 --> 05:27.410
Right now the thing we're here is right if I'm going to go back over here to the smaller screen and

05:27.410 --> 05:32.370
actually get rid of these links or like this when I go back over here they're gone.

05:32.630 --> 05:33.170
All right.

05:33.200 --> 05:38.630
Therefore we need this display flex and we need to have it is important here.

05:38.670 --> 05:39.190
Right.

05:39.230 --> 05:41.090
And then everything is working fine.

05:41.110 --> 05:41.410
All right.

05:41.450 --> 05:48.830
Then there actually doesn't matter if we get rid of them here and if we talk the button and we actually

05:48.830 --> 05:53.590
closed the links once we're going to go back over here they're still going to be over here.

05:53.610 --> 05:54.420
Right.

05:54.530 --> 06:02.870
So once we have this right flex important then we would want a padding 0 and 20 pixels like this.

06:02.870 --> 06:06.950
Then we would want a flex 1 0 0 0.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.650
So we're going to say flex Here one.

06:10.750 --> 06:16.730
So one is going to be four grow zero is going to be for a shrink and are is going to be for flex bases.

06:16.950 --> 06:17.410
Right.

06:17.550 --> 06:22.690
Let's see what we have right now I can see that you actually have a flex ground.

06:22.860 --> 06:23.520
All right.

06:23.540 --> 06:27.860
And now you can see the nav links is actually using the rest of the space.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.380
You can see that it pushed over here.

06:29.410 --> 06:34.200
Now of container because now a container had to flex ground zero.

06:34.250 --> 06:35.190
So it wasn't growing.

06:35.180 --> 06:37.280
It was just auto value right.

06:37.300 --> 06:43.910
And now this one is taking up all the space right now once we have this then what we would want is actually

06:43.910 --> 06:46.920
have it a justified content.

06:47.190 --> 06:51.450
Right flex start and now we're actually dealing it as flex container.

06:51.500 --> 06:56.700
Right now we already dealt as a flex child right now.

06:56.900 --> 07:02.480
Now we're dealing it because this is a container also for the links and or here we're going to have

07:02.590 --> 07:08.840
again our flex wrap and wrap and so they always going to be wrapping once we go to the smaller screen

07:09.550 --> 07:14.150
and over here once we have this right once we have the legs.

07:14.240 --> 07:17.900
Now we're going to work with nav links here a lot.

07:18.260 --> 07:26.480
What we're going to do right here is going to be flex and this is going to be guro zero Aro again grow

07:26.630 --> 07:30.640
with one might grow as much as you have to shrink.

07:30.720 --> 07:30.970
Right.

07:31.040 --> 07:38.290
Don't shrink and the flex basis Ahto so I'll say this again refresh and I can see what we have right.

07:38.340 --> 07:44.140
So this is going to be this little paddock that we added Right now our links have actually grown or

07:44.140 --> 07:44.600
growing.

07:44.610 --> 07:45.330
That's right.

07:45.620 --> 07:52.070
So once we have this now we would want to work with these links and we would want because remember for

07:52.070 --> 07:54.370
these links we had already properties right.

07:54.530 --> 07:58.500
But since this is going to be different screen now we would want a little bit different properties.

07:58.610 --> 08:06.810
So we're going to say we're here now have links links here and we're going to see a link.

08:06.980 --> 08:14.360
And then this is going to be a background transparent like this will have a text line and we're going

08:14.360 --> 08:22.190
to say Center where we like this border radius where we're going to have a five pixels right.

08:22.340 --> 08:24.520
And this is going to be only seen once we're hovering.

08:24.780 --> 08:26.780
And we're going to change the padding and padding.

08:26.780 --> 08:32.570
We're going to change it 20 pixels top bottom left and right only 10 right now.

08:32.610 --> 08:33.540
What are we going to do.

08:33.590 --> 08:41.030
I'm going to send nav links right here like this right a hover and what I don't want is I don't want

08:41.450 --> 08:43.640
the same effect that I have for a smaller screen.

08:43.760 --> 08:44.140
Right.

08:44.330 --> 08:50.690
So I'm going to say or hit a padding left and I'm going to say only 10 pixels Oh this that's right.

08:50.750 --> 08:52.290
So what's happening here right.

08:52.460 --> 08:56.150
So once we refresh you can see the padding is not changing.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.730
My background is changing right.

08:57.740 --> 09:01.760
And you can see or hear this little board or hit right or radius.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.790
However they're not moving anymore right.

09:03.890 --> 09:08.100
Because if you remember over here we had it when we were moving them.

09:08.100 --> 09:08.710
All right.

09:08.810 --> 09:14.270
When we had the live links we had a padding left 30 which was 10 pixels more and that's where they were

09:14.270 --> 09:16.440
moving on a small screen here.

09:16.640 --> 09:23.450
Since we had a padding set to turn now basically saying you know what padding left should also be the

09:23.450 --> 09:23.840
same.

09:23.880 --> 09:24.370
Right.

09:24.490 --> 09:27.820
So and as a result they're not moving.

09:28.250 --> 09:35.180
And once we have with this now what we would want to do is actually get the icons back right because

09:35.180 --> 09:40.130
remember we had initially Heiko but they are not appearing anywhere so far right.

09:40.160 --> 09:49.480
So what are we going to say or here is going to say a now have icons icons or icons or here we're going

09:49.480 --> 09:51.850
to say this play and we'll say flex.

09:51.850 --> 09:57.040
All right let's say it again and let's see over here you see these guys over here.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.820
So these are going to be Iraq guns.

09:59.020 --> 10:07.490
So now we've got a Icahn's back and now we set in as a flex box container parent element right display

10:07.570 --> 10:08.240
flex.

10:08.260 --> 10:12.690
However remember it does not have icons is actually a child.

10:12.880 --> 10:19.310
And because it is a child we can have a flex in 1 0 and auto.

10:19.330 --> 10:19.910
All right.

10:19.930 --> 10:27.810
Again remember that this is still a child the same as nav links as a child and the same as now containers

10:27.820 --> 10:28.370
a all right.

10:28.380 --> 10:29.690
We have three of them.

10:29.920 --> 10:34.420
So what's going to happen and we're going to be fresh and you can see what's happening right.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.830
Not only these ones have moved.

10:36.910 --> 10:39.390
These are growing as much as they need.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.930
Also novel links are here.

10:40.930 --> 10:41.770
That's right.

10:41.770 --> 10:44.450
So what we're going to have is one zero.

10:44.800 --> 10:52.090
And then over here let's do for a flex container parent right because we have it displayed as a flex.

10:52.420 --> 10:58.840
We're going to say flex wrap and we're going to say wrap over here then we're going to have a line self

10:59.170 --> 11:04.600
We're going to say Center you know and this right because we would want them to be lined up.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.190
So we have an order here right.

11:06.190 --> 11:08.150
So now we're here like this.

11:08.170 --> 11:09.430
That's fine.

11:09.430 --> 11:15.420
And then after that we would want a justified content space from home.

11:15.720 --> 11:19.740
So we're going to register for a content space around here like this.

11:19.740 --> 11:24.420
Then let's move to a Nav. icons.

11:24.630 --> 11:27.240
So now icons are.

11:27.790 --> 11:34.690
So here what we're going to say is this is going to be a have icons list item.

11:34.730 --> 11:35.980
And what should happen.

11:35.990 --> 11:41.970
So I'm going to say Flack's here grow one shrink zero and 40 pixels or here.

11:42.180 --> 11:42.710
Right.

11:42.770 --> 11:47.220
And then I'm going to say again text a line and we're going to say Center or here like this.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.110
Right.

11:48.170 --> 11:54.910
Once we have this now what I would want to do is I'm going to get rid of these annoying bullet points.

11:54.920 --> 11:55.490
Right.

11:55.580 --> 11:59.850
So we can go back over here and I'm going to say a list style type.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.170
And I'm going to say none.

12:01.460 --> 12:06.500
And then we're going to add some padding and the padding is going to be 0 and 20 pixels.

12:06.640 --> 12:07.780
That's right.

12:08.120 --> 12:13.570
Now once we have this now will start working with actual links that's all refresh right.

12:13.610 --> 12:15.960
I can see we have justified content space around.

12:15.980 --> 12:16.470
Right.

12:16.520 --> 12:20.030
So we need to actually start working with or here with these legs.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.230
So what are going to say or hear.

12:21.260 --> 12:30.170
This is going to be the have ikons icons and we're going to say and this is going to be font size 30

12:30.170 --> 12:38.550
pixels or hair color and the color is going to be hash tag and this is going to be F C and then we're

12:38.570 --> 12:42.830
going to have B have d b f d or you get this right.

12:42.860 --> 12:50.830
And then after that we would want a transition as we're hovering right but let's just check it over

12:50.840 --> 12:52.190
here we need 8 right.

12:52.210 --> 12:53.370
So now we have it.

12:53.690 --> 12:56.880
So let's refresh and then let's see what happens right.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.830
So now I can see that we have these links on here.

12:59.840 --> 13:05.720
Now what we would want is actually have the hover effect you can see the door here when we should do

13:05.720 --> 13:08.760
is we get these links or here also a line center.

13:08.990 --> 13:12.430
So we're going to find where these are links here.

13:12.560 --> 13:19.470
And with the lengths what you need to do is align self center or here like this.

13:19.550 --> 13:23.410
Once we have this you can see that all of them are lined up perfectly right.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.240
And the reason for that obviously the image is the bigger one.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.050
And then these guys need to follow it.

13:28.140 --> 13:28.400
All right.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.480
So that's the reason for that.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.500
And now once we have this now do the hover effect.

13:33.530 --> 13:34.210
Right.

13:34.250 --> 13:39.580
So let's do here and this is going to be Nav. icons.

13:39.820 --> 13:48.550
And this is going to be a hover and for that cover we're going to have a color hash tag and 5:23 five.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.390
All right.

13:49.390 --> 13:51.610
However let's do a transition or here right.

13:51.630 --> 13:58.000
So I'm going to say a transition and for transition we're going to say color and it's on the same property

13:58.000 --> 13:58.830
over here.

13:58.820 --> 14:00.820
Now let's say two seconds ease.

14:01.060 --> 14:02.800
And just to show you what it does right.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.580
We can add a little bit of delay.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.330
Right.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.920
What 7 this is going to be zero point.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.150
Let's say one second delay.

14:10.170 --> 14:11.460
So would say this.

14:11.550 --> 14:16.610
And once or refresh or here you can see that it's not going to start right away after one second is

14:16.610 --> 14:18.780
actually going to have a hover effect.

14:18.940 --> 14:24.550
And the last thing that we would want with the number is add a few things right first which you can

14:24.550 --> 14:25.820
see or hear right.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.450
It is a transparent background.

14:27.580 --> 14:33.500
However as I start hovering right you can see that I'm going to have here this dark background.

14:33.700 --> 14:36.590
And also I would need to add the smooth scrolling.

14:36.840 --> 14:40.730
And so as I press the button you can see that we have a smooth scrolling.

14:40.870 --> 14:43.830
So that's what we're going to add in the next video.
