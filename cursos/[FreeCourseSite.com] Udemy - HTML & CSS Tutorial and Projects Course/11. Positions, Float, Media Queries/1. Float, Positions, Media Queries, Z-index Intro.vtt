Brilliant.

00:00.960 --> 00:05.570
We're covering CSI has properties like there's no tomorrow and next on THE LIST.

00:05.580 --> 00:13.170
We have flowed clear position property media queries for responsible design Xena X to control and easy

00:13.170 --> 00:20.640
access and before and after pseudo right off the bat I can tell you that if you don't grasp any or all

00:20.640 --> 00:25.510
the properties slash topics we cover don't panic or get discouraged.

00:25.590 --> 00:31.200
We'll use all of them in a project some more than hundred percent positive that if some things might

00:31.200 --> 00:34.440
be unclear they will crystallise in the project setting.

00:34.980 --> 00:37.890
I do want you to get at least a general feel for them.

00:37.890 --> 00:39.250
So here it goes.
