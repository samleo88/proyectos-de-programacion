1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,669
Alright guys, so, we're going to start off

2

00:00:02,669  -->  00:00:05,250
with one of the simplest examples that I

3

00:00:05,250  -->  00:00:08,639
can think of, and that is the world

4

00:00:08,639  -->  00:00:14,130
population by year. So,

5

00:00:14,130  -->  00:00:18,210
what I mean by that is basically I went

6

00:00:18,210  -->  00:00:21,480
to Wikipedia and pulled up world

7

00:00:21,480  -->  00:00:24,119
population here, and when you do that

8

00:00:24,119  -->  00:00:26,550
there's a bunch sections and it looks at

9

00:00:26,550  -->  00:00:28,380
different populations differently,

10

00:00:28,380  -->  00:00:31,410
however if you scroll down the page here

11

00:00:31,410  -->  00:00:38,160
to past population it'll show you from

12

00:00:38,160  -->  00:00:41,910
about 70,000 BCE right up to 2015 CE,

13

00:00:41,910  -->  00:00:43,890
and so that's what we're going to be

14

00:00:43,890  -->  00:00:48,480
building out in a line chart with Python.

15

00:00:48,480  -->  00:00:50,399
So how we're going to do that is, let's

16

00:00:50,399  -->  00:00:53,789
open up our IDE, first we need to import

17

00:00:53,789  -->  00:00:57,960
one of the classes that matplotlib

18

00:00:57,960  -->  00:01:03,480
with provides. So, import matplotlib.

19

00:01:03,480  -->  00:01:11,159
pyplot as plt, and using an

20

00:01:11,159  -->  00:01:13,530
abbreviation for plot just because this

21

00:01:13,530  -->  00:01:16,439
class that we're importing pyplot that

22

00:01:16,439  -->  00:01:19,320
has a method called plot, and so I don't

23

00:01:19,320  -->  00:01:20,490
want to call this plot because that

24

00:01:20,490  -->  00:01:23,490
might get a bit confusing. So I'm going

25

00:01:23,490  -->  00:01:24,780
to drag this over here so that I can

26

00:01:24,780  -->  00:01:27,030
actually see the numbers as i write them,

27

00:01:27,030  -->  00:01:29,909
because we need to make two lists. So the

28

00:01:29,909  -->  00:01:32,220
first list is going to be years, and

29

00:01:32,220  -->  00:01:35,520
that's going to be the x axis, and then

30

00:01:35,520  -->  00:01:37,409
we're going to create the actual

31

00:01:37,409  -->  00:01:40,619
population numbers for each point in

32

00:01:40,619  -->  00:01:44,250
years, and that is going to be the y-axis.

33

00:01:44,250  -->  00:01:48,270
So, let's go ahead and create the list

34

00:01:48,270  -->  00:01:53,970
years, and I'm going to go ahead and just

35

00:01:53,970  -->  00:01:57,149
start right from 1 CE right on from

36

00:01:57,149  -->  00:02:01,619
there. So 1000, 1500, and at this point

37

00:02:01,619  -->  00:02:09,239
once you have 1700 it drops in numerical

38

00:02:09,239  -->  00:02:12,010
increments from

39

00:02:12,010  -->  00:02:21,189
100 to 50. So then 750, 1800, 1850, 1900, and

40

00:02:21,189  -->  00:02:24,549
1950, and at this point it drops from 50

41

00:02:24,549  -->  00:02:26,860
year increments to five year increments. So,

42

00:02:26,860  -->  00:02:49,150
1955, 1960, 1965, 1980, 2000,

43

00:02:49,150  -->  00:03:03,579
2005, 2010, and 2015. Alright, so,

44

00:03:03,579  -->  00:03:06,250
let's go ahead and create our y-axis

45

00:03:06,250  -->  00:03:09,400
which will be actual numbers. So, these

46

00:03:09,400  -->  00:03:12,790
are in millions, so in year one there was

47

00:03:12,790  -->  00:03:15,280
200 million people on the planet, and

48

00:03:15,280  -->  00:03:20,470
once we get into billions it represents

49

00:03:20,470  -->  00:03:24,209
it as a thousand million.

50

00:03:25,080  -->  00:03:30,960
So, what we're going to do is we're going

51

00:03:30,960  -->  00:03:32,400
to go along with that, but just so that

52

00:03:32,400  -->  00:03:33,780
you guys are aware this means

53

00:03:33,780  -->  00:03:36,750
3.6 billion, the means 4 billion, etc.

54

00:03:36,750  -->  00:03:41,580
So, pops is going to be our second list, or

55

00:03:41,580  -->  00:03:44,040
our y-axis, so let's go ahead and write

56

00:03:44,040  -->  00:04:00,060
200 million, 400, 458, 580, 682, where was I,

57

00:04:00,060  -->  00:04:06,930
791, 1000 million, that is

58

00:04:06,930  -->  00:04:20,400
1 billion people, 1262, 2525, 2758,

59

00:04:20,400  -->  00:04:27,440
3018. I'm going to

60

00:04:29,390  -->  00:04:35,120
drop down and continue on another line. Where I

61

00:04:35,120  -->  00:04:39,880
was I? Oh, right, 4061...

62

00:04:45,689  -->  00:04:54,379
alright, almost done here. Oops...

63

00:05:01,529  -->  00:05:04,529
Alright, so, these are both of our lists

64

00:05:04,529  -->  00:05:14,309
here, and what we're going to do is we

65

00:05:14,309  -->  00:05:16,409
just need to put both of the lists into

66

00:05:16,409  -->  00:05:21,059
the plot method. So just run plt.plot,

67

00:05:21,059  -->  00:05:25,799
and we're going to put the x axis in

68

00:05:25,799  -->  00:05:28,619
first which is years, and then pops in

69

00:05:28,619  -->  00:05:31,529
second, and then we're going to say

70

00:05:31,529  -->  00:05:35,879
plt.show. I'm going to save it, and then run

71

00:05:35,879  -->  00:05:38,549
the application, and you're going to see

72

00:05:38,549  -->  00:05:42,689
that we get a chart that shows billions

73

00:05:42,689  -->  00:05:45,239
or these are millions rather on the left

74

00:05:45,239  -->  00:05:50,429
hand side, and years on the bottom. And so

75

00:05:50,429  -->  00:05:52,079
you can actually roll your mouse over it

76

00:05:52,079  -->  00:05:53,249
and on the bottom you can get the

77

00:05:53,249  -->  00:05:55,019
coordinates, and you can kind of assume

78

00:05:55,019  -->  00:05:57,689
different things about it. So this is

79

00:05:57,689  -->  00:06:03,209
year 2017 there is 7.3 billion people I

80

00:06:03,209  -->  00:06:05,219
guess, and as we go up we can actually,

81

00:06:05,219  -->  00:06:10,019
can we calculate? Oh, no, we're

82

00:06:10,019  -->  00:06:11,759
going to put points on here so we can

83

00:06:11,759  -->  00:06:13,619
accurately get numbers, but for right now

84

00:06:13,619  -->  00:06:16,199
it's just showing you know where the

85

00:06:16,199  -->  00:06:19,649
mouse cursor is, and x and y on the chart.

86

00:06:19,649  -->  00:06:22,949
So, that's a basic example of what we can

87

00:06:22,949  -->  00:06:24,689
do and we're going to take this example

88

00:06:24,689  -->  00:06:27,629
and we're going to keep adding different

89

00:06:27,629  -->  00:06:32,629
elements to it to you know make it better.
