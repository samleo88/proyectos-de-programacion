1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,250
So, the very first thing we need to add

2

00:00:02,250  -->  00:00:05,190
here to the player class is a name

3

00:00:05,190  -->  00:00:09,300
attribute. So, we need to pass it in here

4

00:00:09,300  -->  00:00:13,469
and we're going to say self.name =

5

00:00:13,469  -->  00:00:17,310
name. Now, when we instantiate the player

6

00:00:17,310  -->  00:00:19,890
we need to specify their names. So, the

7

00:00:19,890  -->  00:00:22,140
first one is going to be Valos, so

8

00:00:22,140  -->  00:00:25,470
let's go ahead and create player 2 and 3,

9

00:00:25,470  -->  00:00:29,429
there we go. So, now we got player 1, 2, and 3

10

00:00:29,429  -->  00:00:31,109
and they're all named Valos right now,

11

00:00:31,109  -->  00:00:33,600
so let's change that.

12

00:00:33,600  -->  00:00:39,360
There we go. So we've got got player, player  1, player

13

00:00:39,360  -->  00:00:40,920
1, player 2, player 3, they're all named

14

00:00:40,920  -->  00:00:43,290
Valos right now so let's change that.

15

00:00:43,290  -->  00:00:47,309
Second one I'm just going to name him Nick,

16

00:00:47,309  -->  00:00:50,489
and you'll see that I'm actually going

17

00:00:50,489  -->  00:00:52,829
to add a space to make them the same wdith just to make

18

00:00:52,829  -->  00:00:56,280
things easier, and the third one let's just call

19

00:00:56,280  -->  00:01:03,120
them robot. So, we've got three players

20

00:01:03,120  -->  00:01:08,580
instantiated and players is going to be

21

00:01:08,580  -->  00:01:12,330
the list that we reference. So, player one,

22

00:01:12,330  -->  00:01:18,990
player two, player three. Now what we're going to

23

00:01:18,990  -->  00:01:21,390
do is we are, I think the first thing

24

00:01:21,390  -->  00:01:23,580
we're going to do is just copy the

25

00:01:23,580  -->  00:01:26,220
static version of this that we have

26

00:01:26,220  -->  00:01:32,130
right here, and we are going to add it to

27

00:01:32,130  -->  00:01:38,280
the class. So, I'm going to make a

28

00:01:38,280  -->  00:01:44,220
function here called get stats and we

29

00:01:44,220  -->  00:01:48,750
are going to just leeave it like that and paste

30

00:01:48,750  -->  00:01:53,009
our code here. So, instead of printing

31

00:01:53,009  -->  00:01:56,399
this here we're going to, did I instantiate

32

00:01:56,399  -->  00:01:59,040
that with a colon there?

33

00:01:59,040  -->  00:02:02,470
I did.

34

00:02:02,470  -->  00:02:12,370
That's going to look funny there, I should. What we are

35

00:02:12,370  -->  00:02:16,300
going to do in the game file is we're going to replace

36

00:02:16,300  -->  00:02:27,310
this right here with self.name. Now we

37

00:02:27,310  -->  00:02:28,960
need to do the same thing here and here

38

00:02:28,960  -->  00:02:31,090
so it's going to get even messier than

39

00:02:31,090  -->  00:02:32,200
it was, so

40

00:02:32,200  -->  00:02:34,930
let's go ahead for right now we're not going

41

00:02:34,930  -->  00:02:36,970
to worry about alignment we're going to

42

00:02:36,970  -->  00:02:40,360
print out the self hitpoints and self max hitpoints.

43

00:02:40,360  -->  00:02:53,170
So, self.hp, actually that goes right there,

44

00:02:53,170  -->  00:02:58,270
and then self.maxhp right there. And then

45

00:02:58,270  -->  00:03:00,820
for the magic points we are going to, and

46

00:03:00,820  -->  00:03:04,420
I need to add a plus sign there actually, for

47

00:03:04,420  -->  00:03:05,650
the magic points we're going to do the

48

00:03:05,650  -->  00:03:08,380
exact same thing, so I'm going to remove that and

49

00:03:08,380  -->  00:03:22,390
put self.mp out of self.maxmp.

50

00:03:22,390  -->  00:03:26,200
There we go. So, and this is going to

51

00:03:26,200  -->  00:03:27,940
break our entire script because each

52

00:03:27,940  -->  00:03:30,190
player has their own attacks an we've

53

00:03:30,190  -->  00:03:33,220
been using the word player, player.choose_action,

54

00:03:33,220  -->  00:03:35,890
so we will say player 1 choose action.

55

00:03:35,890  -->  00:03:38,350
Actually, for what we're going to do

56

00:03:38,350  -->  00:03:41,140
we're going to say for each player in,

57

00:03:41,140  -->  00:03:49,209
yeah that's what we will do. So, we want the name player

58

00:03:49,209  -->  00:03:55,570
available right there except for taking

59

00:03:55,570  -->  00:03:57,220
damage for right now, so we are going to

60

00:03:57,220  -->  00:03:58,600
have to change this a bit.

61

00:03:58,600  -->  00:04:04,480
So, for player in players we just

62

00:04:04,480  -->  00:04:10,500
need to indent all of this

63

00:04:10,500  -->  00:04:14,670
one space further, and the enemy is going

64

00:04:14,670  -->  00:04:18,359
to attack player one always for now. We are also

65

00:04:18,359  -->  00:04:21,269
going to remove this. At the beginning of

66

00:04:21,269  -->  00:04:26,220
the turn we're going to say print

67

00:04:26,220  -->  00:04:37,110
two line-breaks and then print one

68

00:04:37,110  -->  00:04:39,210
line break. In here we're going to say

69

00:04:39,210  -->  00:04:46,710
player get_stats. So, let's see if we broke anything

70

00:04:46,710  -->  00:04:49,110
yet.

71

00:04:49,110  -->  00:04:55,140
Yep, enemy is

72

00:04:55,140  -->  00:05:03,120
missing a name. So, let's go ahead and say the

73

00:05:03,120  -->  00:05:09,780
enemy let's say it's from chrono

74

00:05:09,780  -->  00:05:11,100
trigger, let's try this again.

75

00:05:11,100  -->  00:05:16,410
Alright, so, we've got all it's stats the same, so let's

76

00:05:16,410  -->  00:05:18,780
mix things up a bit. I'm going to make this guy a bit

77

00:05:18,780  -->  00:05:20,610
stronger, we're going to make everyone a bit

78

00:05:20,610  -->  00:05:21,870
stronger actually, we're going to make

79

00:05:21,870  -->  00:05:26,430
the battle quite a bit longer, and

80

00:05:26,430  -->  00:05:33,180
3089. Alright, let's restart this and we

81

00:05:33,180  -->  00:05:36,660
should see different enemy moves and we don't,

82

00:05:36,660  -->  00:05:39,690
because the only thing that's printing out

83

00:05:39,690  -->  00:05:41,040
here is up here. So, let's go ahead and

84

00:05:41,040  -->  00:05:43,710
remove this, we've got everything we want, and we're

85

00:05:43,710  -->  00:05:45,120
getting an error. L:et's check out what

86

00:05:45,120  -->  00:05:51,750
that error is. So, they are

87

00:05:51,750  -->  00:05:54,450
ints so we actually have to go and specify

88

00:05:54,450  -->  00:05:59,640
it's a string before each number, and I should

89

00:05:59,640  -->  00:06:02,430
have known that. Actually, I did know that, I forgot

90

00:06:02,430  -->  00:06:03,120
it.

91

00:06:03,120  -->  00:06:10,410
Something terrible just happened.

92

00:06:10,410  -->  00:06:12,960
I didn't close these so it's probably freaking

93

00:06:12,960  -->  00:06:23,110
out about that.

94

00:06:23,110  -->  00:06:25,960
There we go. For some reason it only printed

95

00:06:25,960  -->  00:06:28,600
out one player and that's for each

96

00:06:28,600  -->  00:06:31,270
player at the beginning of their turn. So, what

97

00:06:31,270  -->  00:06:33,700
we've gotta do you actually have to

98

00:06:33,700  -->  00:06:40,330
change that, here's what we're going to do we're

99

00:06:40,330  -->  00:06:43,090
going to create another for loop here, it's

100

00:06:43,090  -->  00:06:45,790
a bit confusing but basically if you guys

101

00:06:45,790  -->  00:06:46,960
can't see what happens

102

00:06:46,960  -->  00:06:48,400
we're saying for player in players first

103

00:06:48,400  -->  00:06:51,100
print out that individual players stats

104

00:06:51,100  -->  00:06:54,070
and then do all of this. What we want to

105

00:06:54,070  -->  00:06:57,250
happen first is one loop that actually

106

00:06:57,250  -->  00:07:05,590
prints out the stats, and then

107

00:07:05,590  -->  00:07:07,150
the other one for all the attribute stuff.

108

00:07:07,150  -->  00:07:19,450
So, let's remove that...there. So, let's skip two lines and

109

00:07:19,450  -->  00:07:21,670
print out each player stats, and then

110

00:07:21,670  -->  00:07:23,500
let's start the action. So, let's go ahead and

111

00:07:23,500  -->  00:07:25,840
restart and you'll see now that I've got

112

00:07:25,840  -->  00:07:28,420
my three actual characters and something is

113

00:07:28,420  -->  00:07:30,880
terribly messed up because i forgot the

114

00:07:30,880  -->  00:07:33,220
mp line.

115

00:07:33,220  -->  00:07:39,580
Alright, let's add that here too. Print

116

00:07:39,580  -->  00:07:43,420
"NAME" and the spacing is going to be off for

117

00:07:43,420  -->  00:07:58,000
sure, let me check. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...21.

118

00:07:58,000  -->  00:08:09,760
So, hit point and then from hit

119

00:08:09,760  -->  00:08:20,560
points 25...

120

00:08:20,560  -->  00:08:34,450
36. So,

121

00:08:34,450  -->  00:08:37,660
there go that should be about right. Let

122

00:08:37,660  -->  00:08:42,730
me go ahead and restart it, and this needs to go one

123

00:08:42,730  -->  00:08:48,010
back, I think, and then the lines here at the top

124

00:08:48,010  -->  00:08:54,100
of each bar need to go forward one space. So, that forward one, and that

125

00:08:54,100  -->  00:09:03,010
should actually fix it. Nope, one more. There we go.

126

00:09:03,010  -->  00:09:07,270
So, that is our dynamic player

127

00:09:07,270  -->  00:09:10,750
creation we have at the top of each turn,

128

00:09:10,750  -->  00:09:13,060
and each person is going to take their

129

00:09:13,060  -->  00:09:16,360
own turn for their actions. So, we need to

130

00:09:16,360  -->  00:09:20,020
specify at the top of actions which player

131

00:09:20,020  -->  00:09:23,860
it is attacking. So, it's going to go in

132

00:09:23,860  -->  00:09:25,900
order so Valos, then Nick, then Robot, so we

133

00:09:25,900  -->  00:09:29,350
need to actually print that out. So,

134

00:09:29,350  -->  00:09:47,160
let's just one line above it maybe,

135

00:09:47,160  -->  00:09:58,319
yeah. There we go, bcolors.BOLD, self.name, bcolors.ENDC.

136

00:09:58,319  -->  00:10:06,209
We remove that beginning line there. So,

137

00:10:06,209  -->  00:10:07,920
Valos is going to attack,

138

00:10:07,920  -->  00:10:11,129
Nick is going to use magic, the magic

139

00:10:11,129  -->  00:10:13,350
is going to be meteor, then robot is

140

00:10:13,350  -->  00:10:16,709
going to attack. Now, we also need to

141

00:10:16,709  -->  00:10:22,589
print out each person's damage summary after each

142

00:10:22,589  -->  00:10:24,779
one, so instead of printing that at the end

143

00:10:24,779  -->  00:10:26,310
I believe we're printing it outside that loop right

144

00:10:26,310  -->  00:10:26,970
now.

145

00:10:26,970  -->  00:10:36,149
No, okay. So, you attack then it says meteor

146

00:10:36,149  -->  00:10:38,459
deals okay, so we need to specify

147

00:10:38,459  -->  00:10:40,199
that, so it's getting a bit messy as you can

148

00:10:40,199  -->  00:10:46,439
see. Yeah, what I'm going to do is

149

00:10:46,439  -->  00:10:52,350
actually indent that as well. So, not over here, where

150

00:10:52,350  -->  00:11:02,430
it says name skip four spaces. It's action

151

00:11:02,430  -->  00:11:08,430
same thing.

152

00:11:08,430  -->  00:11:10,830
So, all actions are going to be printed

153

00:11:10,830  -->  00:11:15,600
this far in, and then details about is

154

00:11:15,600  -->  00:11:30,430
going to be printed down there.

155

00:11:30,430  -->  00:11:43,899
There we go. Alright, and actually, okay. So, let

156

00:11:43,899  -->  00:11:47,830
me do this so I can show you. So, the text of

157

00:11:47,830  -->  00:11:49,390
what's happening is going to be printed

158

00:11:49,390  -->  00:11:52,089
at the beginning of the line, menus

159

00:11:52,089  -->  00:11:53,890
are going to open four spaces in, and

160

00:11:53,890  -->  00:11:54,610
then

161

00:11:54,610  -->  00:11:56,320
options are going to open four spaces in

162

00:11:56,320  -->  00:12:00,100
from that. So, I'm going to go and add

163

00:12:00,100  -->  00:12:03,250
four spaces to actions, magic, and items. So,

164

00:12:03,250  -->  00:12:08,140
1, 2, 3, 4...1, 2, 3, 4...and 1, 2, 3, 4.

165

00:12:08,140  -->  00:12:11,290
There we go. It should look a little better.

166

00:12:11,290  -->  00:12:18,940
There we go. As you can see, there we go, and as you can see

167

00:12:18,940  -->  00:12:25,390
Robot chooses he's going to use an item, uses the potion, and

168

00:12:25,390  -->  00:12:26,709
the enemy attacks but he didn't attack

169

00:12:26,709  -->  00:12:28,360
anybody because there's now three

170

00:12:28,360  -->  00:12:31,300
targets that he's choosing via

171

00:12:31,300  -->  00:12:36,670
different values. So, that's how to

172

00:12:36,670  -->  00:12:39,550
implement three characters, kind of,

173

00:12:39,550  -->  00:12:43,630
we now need to rig up the magic points

174

00:12:43,630  -->  00:12:49,810
to each person. So, actually, hold on a sec.

175

00:12:49,810  -->  00:12:52,930
Oh, yeah, it did okay, so that was the top one.

176

00:12:52,930  -->  00:12:55,390
Alright, so yeah the MP what we need to

177

00:12:55,390  -->  00:12:57,250
do next is the progress bars here and

178

00:12:57,250  -->  00:12:58,630
makes them actually work, we're going to

179

00:12:58,630  -->  00:13:05,459
save that for the next video.
