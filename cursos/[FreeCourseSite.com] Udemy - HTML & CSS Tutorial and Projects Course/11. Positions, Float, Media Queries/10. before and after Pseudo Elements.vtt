WEBVTT

00:00.860 --> 00:01.420
All right.

00:01.450 --> 00:03.470
We have covered position absolute.

00:03.470 --> 00:05.780
We have covered z index.

00:05.780 --> 00:10.800
So I think this would be a great time to look into pseudo elements before and after.

00:10.870 --> 00:17.540
In every practical case pseudo elements start specific parts of the element like for example in the

00:17.540 --> 00:23.300
case of before and after you guessed it before and after the element.

00:23.300 --> 00:29.420
But what's more cool we can insert HCM all dynamically from our shares is essentially allowing us to

00:29.420 --> 00:31.550
avoid extra markup.

00:31.550 --> 00:32.780
Don't believe me.

00:32.780 --> 00:33.770
Why don't we take a look.

00:33.830 --> 00:39.860
And by the way this might be a longer example because we were going to cover multiple other things as

00:39.860 --> 00:43.360
well like smaller things but still important.

00:43.670 --> 00:49.010
First and foremost I would like to get rid of the all the old stuff so I'm going to say all of you guys

00:49.130 --> 00:51.160
gone disappear.

00:51.290 --> 00:53.600
We'll head over back to indexation the email.

00:53.810 --> 00:56.460
We're gonna do a little bit of spring cleaning too.

00:56.480 --> 01:02.560
We're going to say that in the next stage CML we would just want first of all one paragraph that's it.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.250
Nothing really special.

01:04.370 --> 01:15.980
One paragraph on the way here let's write that down on before and after a pseudo pseudo elements just

01:15.980 --> 01:17.510
like the video name.

01:17.710 --> 01:24.470
I'd say it and we have the paragraph now I'm gonna head over back to the CEO says I can first very start

01:24.470 --> 01:30.220
very simply by saying that p and now I'm going to have the colon.

01:30.260 --> 01:35.300
Now what you're going to see maybe be an older syntax is something like this where people just wrote

01:36.230 --> 01:40.760
the name of the element because we are all going to be inserting before or after the paragraph.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.100
And then one colon.

01:42.100 --> 01:47.720
However you should probably stick with a CSF three syntax where you adding two columns.

01:47.720 --> 01:50.890
Again you'll see one colon and technically that is correct.

01:50.900 --> 01:53.170
But I would suggest working with two columns.

01:53.380 --> 01:59.930
And here we're gonna write the first one we've the element before and what's happening next and nothing

01:59.930 --> 02:03.870
is happening technically next but we always need to have the content.

02:04.220 --> 02:06.770
So the content properties should be always there.

02:06.770 --> 02:09.990
Now I'm going to show you example what happens if we don't added.

02:10.160 --> 02:13.220
But first let's just say content then we have the colon.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.280
And now what we would like to write over here.

02:15.620 --> 02:17.180
Well let's say I'm going to write over here.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.100
Hello.

02:18.110 --> 02:19.820
And I'm looking at the space.

02:20.030 --> 02:21.850
And check this out.

02:22.010 --> 02:25.840
Now the moment we're going to save the sea assets we'll see the hell over here.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.640
So that's really neat about the content.

02:28.640 --> 02:34.540
This is very much adding the content in our age the amount we didn't need to add this content.

02:34.610 --> 02:38.370
Don't believe me you can head over back to our browser tools.

02:38.540 --> 02:45.110
We can see the inspection and then as I'm looking at my body and I don't I mean this can say for now

02:45.170 --> 02:51.470
I think it's gonna be fine but if I'm looking at the paragraph notice we're having the day before we

02:51.470 --> 02:54.200
didn't have it here as the markup in the HD email.

02:54.660 --> 02:58.970
However we are able to do that from our CSF which is really really cool.

02:58.970 --> 03:05.360
Again very basic example right now where we can do a lot of interesting features using this now.

03:05.660 --> 03:06.990
What else we can do.

03:07.190 --> 03:14.930
Well we can add whatever CSF we would like or so I can say font let's say Wait you're gonna be bald.

03:15.380 --> 03:21.410
Then we can be looking for font size and say font size to our image or something like that.

03:21.440 --> 03:25.750
So very very massive text as well as maybe let's add colour.

03:26.010 --> 03:31.640
So the colour can be red and I can go on and on and on and actually we will gonna do that because we're

03:31.640 --> 03:37.460
gonna be looking at a little bit more sophisticated examples but to understand the basic idea we can

03:37.460 --> 03:43.080
add some kind of content before and after the content of the paragraph.

03:43.130 --> 03:48.920
Now that is important because if we're looking at the actual browser tools we see that this is before

03:48.950 --> 03:53.630
and after the content and this is going to become important once we're going to talk about images.

03:53.630 --> 03:57.000
So just please remember that Mark what we have next.

03:57.230 --> 03:58.810
Well let's look at the after.

03:58.820 --> 04:01.580
So again the syntax is going to be exactly the same.

04:01.630 --> 04:06.190
And why don't we start the same way where we just look at the content properly.

04:06.290 --> 04:07.660
So I'm going to say content.

04:08.200 --> 04:13.070
And in this case we're just going to write after the Hmong we say it we notice the little laughter so

04:13.070 --> 04:14.480
we know that this is gonna be work.

04:14.870 --> 04:17.440
But what if I would want to insert some kind of box here.

04:18.080 --> 04:20.680
Well at the moment everything is happening in line.

04:20.750 --> 04:26.300
We're seeing that whatever content we were adding this was happily happening in line and that is happening

04:26.300 --> 04:32.590
by default mode of what if I would copy and paste them and let's add it over here too and notice obviously

04:32.630 --> 04:37.160
this is going to be right now on the second line because there's more text more I can bring it back

04:37.160 --> 04:43.880
to the one line because again this is all in line happening but what we can do is we can do this is

04:43.970 --> 04:50.630
display block so I can say it like this instead of display in line I can just change this we can do

04:50.630 --> 04:57.620
a display block text is gonna be red but we can add let's say a background which is gonna be black and

04:57.620 --> 04:58.920
what happens now.

04:58.940 --> 05:05.930
Well we added the content in before and after the paragraph but we can add it as a block.

05:05.940 --> 05:11.550
So I can do the same thing over here and we can copy and paste it and sure enough what's going to happen

05:11.550 --> 05:16.620
is that I'm going to have my paragraph but before and after the content of the paragraph I'm going to

05:16.620 --> 05:22.310
have my pseudo elements and as you're looking and you're like OK well what if I don't want a text.

05:22.380 --> 05:24.860
What if let's say we would want some kind of box.

05:24.880 --> 05:25.320
Mm hmm.

05:25.350 --> 05:25.710
I don't know.

05:25.740 --> 05:30.390
Let's try it out so we can say we're here like this or I'm gonna delete everything that we had here

05:30.900 --> 05:36.720
and we can say this play this is gonna be display block why don't we get rid of the text because let's

05:36.720 --> 05:43.830
say we would just want simple box and more we will can add or here well we can do with maybe 50 pixels

05:44.310 --> 05:49.860
can do height 50 pixels and we can do background I don't know green.

05:50.020 --> 05:51.390
So something like this.

05:51.390 --> 05:52.620
Now what happens.

05:52.620 --> 05:56.510
Well the block is displayed so everything is working fine.

05:56.650 --> 06:02.380
But what if I decide and I say well what is the point of this content if all I want is here the book.

06:02.380 --> 06:05.080
So technically I wanted content only with a hello.

06:05.530 --> 06:10.910
Okay let's test it out I'm gonna come on out and sure enough nothing of this is displayed.

06:11.370 --> 06:17.280
And this is something that I want you to take away that content property even with an empty value is

06:17.280 --> 06:18.250
required.

06:18.330 --> 06:23.490
So whenever you want answered something even though there's not going be a text you do need to have

06:23.490 --> 06:25.490
this property with this kind of value.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.910
Simple enough.

06:26.910 --> 06:31.710
And typically I could just stop here with this example and say that okay we covered everything that

06:31.710 --> 06:35.900
there was at least at this point where is it before and after elements.

06:35.940 --> 06:40.530
But I would like to make a little bit more interesting example where I would kind of want to show you

06:40.530 --> 06:46.410
that how we can use position absolute so we can use the same index and more realistic scenario where

06:46.410 --> 06:50.880
you would use this because at the moment you're probably looking at it and you're like Okay thanks for

06:50.880 --> 06:51.410
telling me.

06:51.430 --> 06:56.760
But that is probably the first and only time that I'm gonna do that where in fact you can use the before

06:56.760 --> 06:57.600
and after.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.870
In a lot of interesting cases.

07:00.120 --> 07:06.240
Now enough of me mapping and let's head over to index H CML and we'll then add one more thing so we're

07:06.270 --> 07:11.370
gonna say here right after the paragraph now you can delete this you can delete the h the imbalance

07:11.370 --> 07:13.750
it says I'm going to leave it just in case.

07:13.750 --> 07:20.130
So you have it for your own explorations later on but I'm going to say here div and I'm going to add

07:20.130 --> 07:20.930
the image.

07:20.930 --> 07:22.020
Now this is important.

07:22.230 --> 07:28.730
So make sure that you're adding the of image because we're all gonna get over this image and just to

07:28.740 --> 07:33.530
give you a hint we're not going to be able to add before and after for the image and again we're going

07:33.530 --> 07:39.720
to cover this in a few seconds but just make sure you have the div and you have the image and also do

07:39.720 --> 07:45.330
that because I would like to show you a few other things how the image is gonna be interacting with

07:45.330 --> 07:48.010
this div and how we're going to use this later on.

07:48.540 --> 07:54.990
Let's start maybe with a I don't know what can do big a major we can do the small image you know what.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.330
Now let's do the big one because I do want to show you the actual responsive images.

08:00.330 --> 08:03.250
So at the moment obviously this image is massive.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.590
We already knew that.

08:04.590 --> 08:11.580
So typically what we would do now we're going to rush back to the US and we're going to right away try

08:11.580 --> 08:16.680
to add whatever property where we would change the width so we could do something like this we could

08:16.680 --> 08:22.440
say image is going to be the width of I don't know 300 and then hope for the best.

08:22.440 --> 08:29.780
The image is going to look like this but while this works and all this is fine there is a better way.

08:29.850 --> 08:35.880
What we're going to use all throughout probably the project will not every single case but you understand

08:35.880 --> 08:39.600
the idea where I'm gonna first work with a div.

08:39.600 --> 08:44.580
So I'm going to say that Dave is going to have some kind of with and in most cases that width is going

08:44.580 --> 08:49.560
to be responsive and then the image is gonna be set responsive to that Dave.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.450
Now how does that work.

08:50.890 --> 08:56.910
Well all I can say Dave since I have the Dave and for the developments that I'm gonna say with off let's

08:56.910 --> 09:00.180
say 50 view widths again we already know this.

09:00.300 --> 09:06.120
This would be the percentages of the screen and then let's add some margin to it let's say margin.

09:06.130 --> 09:08.980
Hundred pixels to a bottom and on the left and right.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.210
So I know that I'm gonna have it here somewhere in the middle.

09:12.210 --> 09:16.780
Now I also like to add maybe a let's say border.

09:17.070 --> 09:24.540
So let's say border to pixels solid just so you can see a few other things later on and solid or not

09:24.570 --> 09:28.940
as always we're going to go with red now OK so we're getting somewhere.

09:28.980 --> 09:33.570
So we have the right now the width of an image with something three hundred.

09:33.630 --> 09:37.170
And then Dave is actually responsive as it is sitting in the center.

09:37.500 --> 09:44.570
However what's happening is you see that the image obviously doesn't fit here so what we can do is with

09:44.570 --> 09:45.410
an image.

09:45.410 --> 09:50.240
So since this is already responsive we can add the hundred percent.

09:50.300 --> 09:57.490
So what's happening right now is the image is gonna be responsive depending on a day of meaning has

09:57.520 --> 10:00.680
I'm going to increase the size of the div.

10:00.710 --> 10:06.500
Also my image is gonna increase because I already set this up with hundred percent.

10:06.500 --> 10:12.080
So if we're gonna be creating some kind of column layout or anything like that this is exactly the syntax

10:12.080 --> 10:13.430
we're gonna be using.

10:13.460 --> 10:19.470
What are you noticing though is that even though the Dave covers nicely left and right and top there's

10:19.520 --> 10:26.740
this space in the bottom and you might be tempted to say well okay so I had the with me and the height

10:27.110 --> 10:29.720
and hopefully for the best everything is gonna work out.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.090
And the moment we say Well nothing changes.

10:32.090 --> 10:37.880
And in order to get rid of this annoying space in between let's say what we're going to have in Dave

10:37.970 --> 10:43.370
as well as the image we're gonna have to make the display property and we're going to strip display

10:43.460 --> 10:48.890
not in line but we're gonna have to display a block and this has nothing to do with before and after

10:48.890 --> 10:50.180
pseudo element.

10:50.180 --> 10:56.660
This has everything to do with how we're gonna be later on working with a Dave and image again and syntax

10:56.660 --> 10:58.350
would be that water.

10:58.370 --> 11:02.330
Let's say some kind of column layout that Dave is gonna be responsive.

11:02.330 --> 11:07.310
Then for Dave I don't think we'll gonna be adding more each and every time but we're gonna be adding

11:07.310 --> 11:09.270
the image within the Dave.

11:09.320 --> 11:15.140
And then the image is gonna be responsive depending on the width of the actual Dave as well as we're

11:15.140 --> 11:17.150
gonna set it as display block.

11:17.150 --> 11:19.220
Now we technically don't have to do it.

11:19.280 --> 11:24.440
We could have avoided that but by showing you this I believe that I'm going save you a little bit of

11:24.440 --> 11:29.660
time because as you're gonna be working with CSX eventually you're gonna have some kind of paragraph.

11:29.680 --> 11:34.160
Let's say hello there or something like this.

11:34.280 --> 11:37.520
And now for sure you're going to have some kind of input.

11:37.550 --> 11:42.760
Now obviously I'm gonna bring my paragraph right now because I already have selected all the paragraphs.

11:42.870 --> 11:48.470
Let me fix this let's say there's gonna be a hearing one and now you're gonna be able to style actually

11:48.590 --> 11:54.770
on the basic selection instead of what would happen if you were going to remove display block.

11:54.800 --> 12:00.290
What you're gonna see there is gonna be this extra margin some extra space and you're gonna be sometimes

12:00.290 --> 12:05.690
real annoyed when you're like listen I'm styling this left and right how I would want but this is not

12:05.690 --> 12:06.110
working.

12:06.440 --> 12:11.990
So in order to get rid of this annoying default margin that you're getting again we would just need

12:11.990 --> 12:16.640
to use display and display a block got nothing to do with zero elements.

12:16.640 --> 12:22.370
Everything has to do with how we're gonna be later on working with our devs and how they're are gonna

12:22.370 --> 12:26.130
be interacting with images within the device market.

12:26.270 --> 12:27.670
So we have covered this one.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.810
Now let me get rid of this water.

12:30.830 --> 12:34.210
We don't need this and now let's decide what we're gonna do.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.280
Well we can start working with before and after.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.830
Now the temptation would be like this.

12:39.830 --> 12:44.810
Well I have the image and I would like to insert something here in between the image so I could just

12:44.810 --> 12:53.090
say image before and let's go for the content and let's start very simply by not content and the content

12:53.090 --> 12:54.020
is gonna be hollow.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.650
Now the moment we say it nothing happens.

12:56.750 --> 13:03.230
And the reason why nothing happens because image element and I'm really shorten that this is obviously

13:03.230 --> 13:10.160
big theory behind this and all that but in general terms image is already the content because again

13:10.340 --> 13:11.150
let me repeat.

13:11.150 --> 13:12.650
And this was the wrong screen.

13:12.740 --> 13:17.860
If we're heading over again to our paragraph we're noticing that this is placed before and after the

13:17.860 --> 13:18.420
count.

13:18.870 --> 13:22.940
Now image tagged by itself the image is the content.

13:23.060 --> 13:24.800
So we're not gonna be able to do that.

13:24.830 --> 13:29.540
Long story short you're not gonna be able to add before and after for your image.

13:29.540 --> 13:34.190
This was one of the reasons why we added the dev because we do want to work with these new developments

13:34.490 --> 13:35.390
now in the process.

13:35.390 --> 13:42.110
I also showed you other things about how the devs with images are gonna be interacting but in general

13:42.800 --> 13:44.420
you're not going to be successful.

13:44.420 --> 13:49.390
So I mean I can repeat this 10 more times but this is not going to work.

13:49.550 --> 13:50.610
So far so good.

13:50.660 --> 13:51.600
We have covered this.

13:51.620 --> 13:52.610
What else we have left.

13:52.970 --> 13:59.670
Well why don't we actually look how we can insert the before and after as we having the dev an image.

13:59.690 --> 14:01.920
Now for the dev is actually very simple.

14:01.940 --> 14:07.400
We do have the content and then say Dev before Hello there buddy.

14:07.550 --> 14:09.020
And what I would like here.

14:09.110 --> 14:12.500
Well I know I need to have the content so I'm going to say content.

14:12.530 --> 14:16.440
And even though there's going to be something else I'm just going to say the empty content.

14:16.520 --> 14:17.670
So what else I would like.

14:17.750 --> 14:24.730
Well I'm gonna say border is gonna be two pixels solid and let's go with grey one.

14:24.770 --> 14:25.360
Okay.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.980
So for now I'm having this guy.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.930
So there's some kind of border.

14:29.030 --> 14:31.340
Okay why don't I make this interesting.

14:31.340 --> 14:36.110
I know that there's some kind of with and there's some kind of height and I know that I have the div

14:36.670 --> 14:44.330
so why don't I make it the with the B not some pixels not some absolute value but also percent as well

14:44.330 --> 14:47.240
as why don't make it height 1 percent.

14:47.230 --> 14:49.700
So I can just say here high 9 percent.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.550
Now the moment we say it then nothing changes.

14:53.570 --> 14:54.610
Okay.

14:54.830 --> 14:56.930
But we already know the position absolute right.

14:57.470 --> 15:00.910
So I can just say position it is gonna be absolute none.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.120
Let's see what happens.

15:02.180 --> 15:05.330
Not relative but absolute.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.760
What happens now.

15:06.800 --> 15:07.800
This is really big.

15:08.300 --> 15:09.010
Okay.

15:09.020 --> 15:11.490
Probably not something that we wanted.

15:11.540 --> 15:11.850
Mm hmm.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.410
What else we can do.

15:13.430 --> 15:16.660
Well we remember that whenever we were working with position absolute.

15:16.670 --> 15:17.900
This was looking for one.

15:18.500 --> 15:25.580
Well for the first ancestor that had what the position of relative because otherwise this is looking

15:25.580 --> 15:26.390
for the body.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.120
That's the reason why this is so massive.

15:28.580 --> 15:30.590
So what would be the solution.

15:30.590 --> 15:32.080
Well we have the answers there.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.620
The answers there would be live.

15:33.680 --> 15:38.770
In this case and what we can do is position and we're looking for relative.

15:38.880 --> 15:42.230
Now what happens is that this is gonna be a hundred percent.

15:42.230 --> 15:47.030
Now you can not be arguing you can say well this is not really hundred percent because what's happening

15:47.030 --> 15:48.000
right now you cannot.

15:48.110 --> 15:52.640
You can see these patients here and the reason for that again is going to be the border box so we can

15:52.640 --> 15:58.550
have box sizing and not Mark's shadow for some reason this is popping up and we will by the way Carol

15:58.550 --> 15:59.470
box shadow.

15:59.480 --> 16:04.630
So that's gonna be covered but if I'm gonna go with Mark sizing is this one.

16:04.700 --> 16:11.720
So right now I'm having the actual border box and what's really cool is that this is exactly like I

16:11.720 --> 16:13.050
would have when I.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.360
So you notice the idea.

16:14.420 --> 16:21.230
So we added this to pixels and now this is gonna be a hundred percent hundred height and then this way

16:21.260 --> 16:24.100
we can start actually doing some more interesting things.

16:24.110 --> 16:26.160
Now what would be the more interesting things.

16:26.300 --> 16:34.130
Well we know that we can place that relative relative obviously to our ancestor and also we can use

16:34.130 --> 16:35.310
the negative values.

16:35.320 --> 16:35.800
Mm hmm.

16:35.840 --> 16:36.890
So how this is gonna work.

16:36.980 --> 16:43.210
So I could say top is gonna be negative 40 pixels so I'm gonna lift that up a little bit as well as

16:43.220 --> 16:45.830
left is gonna be negative 40 pixels.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.630
So where this guy's gonna go.

16:47.630 --> 16:52.430
Well now this is gonna be sitting right here one annoying thing you might be looking at you're like

16:52.460 --> 16:57.770
Yeah well okay it looks kind of cool but why this is covering the image right now.

16:58.010 --> 16:59.960
Well you don't want to go wrong image.

16:59.960 --> 17:00.930
What do we have.

17:00.980 --> 17:06.490
What property we had in Nairobi actually showed you so probably the easy answer would be well z index

17:06.500 --> 17:07.130
right.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.640
So what is the scene next right now for the image.

17:09.650 --> 17:15.850
Now that's actually automatically zero but if I'm gonna make for days gone negative too what happens.

17:15.980 --> 17:18.690
Well now this is gonna be hidden behind them.

17:19.880 --> 17:20.630
So far so good.

17:20.630 --> 17:24.950
Why don't we take a look at the after one and here I'm gonna do something like this.

17:24.950 --> 17:30.770
I'm going to say Dave after Now in this case I would like to copy and paste a lot of them because I

17:30.770 --> 17:33.120
don't want to rewrite them all one by one.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.740
So I'm just gonna say something like this and now let's change the values.

17:36.920 --> 17:41.720
So we have Dave before and after content is this gonna stay the same empty.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.760
However here I'm not gonna be looking for the.

17:43.970 --> 17:50.690
I'm gonna say that there is gonna be actual background so not a border grey but we're gonna say background

17:50.750 --> 17:53.600
great so background is gonna be grey.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.460
Now what is gonna happen here.

17:55.460 --> 17:59.420
Well for now we're gonna cover everything because obviously the width and height is hundred percent

17:59.960 --> 18:04.090
and what we're doing is we're having this top is negative 40.

18:04.310 --> 18:05.760
But I can change this.

18:06.110 --> 18:12.600
I can say top is going to be negative 20 left is gonna be negative 20 as well as let's create a Z in

18:12.620 --> 18:14.010
next little bit smaller.

18:14.120 --> 18:19.460
So this is should be sitting all the way on the back then we're gonna be having this image we're not

18:19.460 --> 18:24.440
image basically block with background on grey and then we having our image.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.070
Okay.

18:25.250 --> 18:32.000
So this probably would be a little bit more interesting example where we can start using again the pseudo

18:32.000 --> 18:33.530
elements before and after.

18:33.770 --> 18:39.380
Probably again not the biggest example that you could see in the world.

18:39.380 --> 18:45.170
Meaning you can use all kinds of other things with pseudo element but at least this would give you like

18:45.170 --> 18:49.340
a little taste where it would be much more interesting than just displaying the block.

18:49.370 --> 18:51.350
Now we can add the block votes.

18:51.350 --> 18:54.130
I mean again there's tons of interesting things we can do.

18:54.260 --> 18:58.550
This is just I think in my opinion more interesting than what we didn't before.

18:58.700 --> 19:03.530
And you don't have to do this along with me because we haven't covered a few of these properties.

19:04.430 --> 19:09.320
But just to show you how this was going to interact with the page I'm gonna add some things we haven't

19:09.320 --> 19:10.300
covered yet again.

19:10.310 --> 19:11.560
You don't have to do them.

19:11.630 --> 19:18.530
I'm gonna leave them in your code so you can maybe actually explore them later on but don't worry about

19:18.530 --> 19:18.960
it again.

19:18.980 --> 19:24.110
We haven't covered them but what I would like to do right now is as I'm hovering I would want these

19:24.110 --> 19:24.770
guys to move.

19:25.130 --> 19:26.210
So how this is gonna work.

19:26.660 --> 19:30.270
Well first of all I'm gonna head over here and again we're going to cover.

19:30.380 --> 19:32.470
We're gonna write something we haven't done yet.

19:32.660 --> 19:35.600
So I'm going to say as I'm hovering the dev I would want.

19:35.600 --> 19:38.350
Before and after to actually move.

19:38.350 --> 19:44.470
So when would say after and I'm gonna copy and paste it one thing we have covered though even though

19:44.470 --> 19:48.130
we don't now understand the selectors yet we have covered that.

19:48.130 --> 19:50.050
We can actually group in together right.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.680
So I can say before and after.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.660
So both of them are going to be selected.

19:55.660 --> 19:56.460
And what I would want.

19:56.470 --> 19:58.660
Well I would want top of them.

19:58.780 --> 20:02.310
These zero left of them to be zero.

20:02.390 --> 20:04.000
And yeah that's gonna be it.

20:04.060 --> 20:05.310
So let me say this.

20:05.350 --> 20:06.980
Okay so what happened.

20:06.990 --> 20:11.180
So as I'm hovering This is actually getting headed now.

20:11.410 --> 20:16.150
We can also add a little bit of transition and again please don't worry about the properties the values

20:16.510 --> 20:18.190
we will gonna cover them as.

20:18.190 --> 20:20.140
Also don't worry about the selector.

20:20.140 --> 20:27.160
This is gonna be covered in few videos but what I can do here is I can say transition and you can do

20:27.160 --> 20:34.550
all zero point five pixels and we're going to write linear and now let me copy and paste this line of

20:34.550 --> 20:35.650
code.

20:35.690 --> 20:37.220
I'm gonna head over here.

20:37.310 --> 20:38.600
Copy and paste it to.

20:38.750 --> 20:39.900
And check this out.

20:39.930 --> 20:44.300
So as I'm hovering now this is happening over zero point five seconds.

20:44.540 --> 20:51.440
Much more color example than what we looked at a simple block and simple text here on the top.

20:51.440 --> 20:56.320
And in general terms this is how you would use the before and after elements.

20:56.330 --> 21:01.850
Just remember again you need to use the content you are not going to be successful using with an image

21:02.540 --> 21:09.590
and you're placing this before and after the actual content of the element not before and after the

21:09.590 --> 21:09.980
element.
