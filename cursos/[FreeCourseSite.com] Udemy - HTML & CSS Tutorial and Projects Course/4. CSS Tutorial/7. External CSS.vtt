WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:01.490
So far so good.

00:01.530 --> 00:06.340
We know what is the online success as well as the internal success.

00:06.360 --> 00:11.700
However there is also a tiny issue with internal success.

00:11.760 --> 00:12.930
Now what would be the issue.

00:12.930 --> 00:18.870
Well we are lacking flexibility for multiple pages and I think it is going to be easier for me to show

00:18.870 --> 00:19.310
you.

00:19.350 --> 00:25.260
Then again to talk about it for let's say half an hour or so we need to create another page and I'm

00:25.260 --> 00:30.600
gonna say there's going to be new file I'm going to call this page about the email and again we're gonna

00:30.600 --> 00:32.390
have to get some kind of structure.

00:32.640 --> 00:38.460
So I'm gonna say that first of all I would like to get the basic email structure so let me delete this

00:38.850 --> 00:44.370
and let's say they're all gonna be looking for again some kind of writing ones I'd say having one and

00:44.370 --> 00:50.460
we can do the same thing Hello World and let's copy and paste it and maybe let's also add the heading

00:50.470 --> 00:52.740
to just so we're staying consistent.

00:52.740 --> 00:54.610
Now we're all gonna say hello.

00:54.600 --> 00:58.890
People just like we did before and let's copy let's say three lines.

00:59.600 --> 01:05.070
So first of all I would obviously like to see on my about page is going to look and here maybe let's

01:05.130 --> 01:11.070
add another title just so we know that this is gonna be about page and how much write it entitled.

01:11.070 --> 01:13.980
This isn't about page and you know what.

01:14.010 --> 01:18.220
Let's also write away set up to link is that way we can navigate much more easier.

01:18.660 --> 01:24.270
So I'm gonna say somewhere within my index page the indexation email all the way in the top we're gonna

01:24.270 --> 01:25.870
say that there is gonna be a link.

01:26.040 --> 01:32.760
The link is gonna go to about the next page or about the email page and let's just say about page.

01:32.760 --> 01:37.720
Now I can do the same link in the about page just so we can navigate back.

01:37.830 --> 01:44.600
So we're gonna head over to my about page and instead of about the email I was gonna write indexation

01:44.600 --> 01:48.070
email and let's just change this to a homepage.

01:48.270 --> 01:54.090
So again we're just setting up easy navigation just so we don't have to deal with whatever tabs here.

01:54.660 --> 01:56.720
So let's say here we're going to get rid of this.

01:56.730 --> 01:57.930
We're going to save it.

01:57.930 --> 02:00.240
And now I have my about page link.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.430
Now if I head over to about page what do I see.

02:03.480 --> 02:08.690
Well I see that there is pretty much three having once and then the heading to.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.440
But obviously all of them are not stop.

02:11.880 --> 02:12.950
So I would have to stop.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.470
Well the easy way would be well I mean it's very simple.

02:17.610 --> 02:21.090
We're just going to grab the style tags we're going to copy and paste them here.

02:21.670 --> 02:26.780
I'm not gonna say that somewhere again within the head element within the about page.

02:26.850 --> 02:28.510
We're going to copy and paste them.

02:28.560 --> 02:29.800
Sure enough I have my stop.

02:30.390 --> 02:38.010
So everything is working really nice but let's say I don't know next day or next hour or whatever.

02:38.260 --> 02:43.990
Sometime after I have created this initial start I changed my mind and I say you know what.

02:44.180 --> 02:50.000
This chocolate colour doesn't really look good so let's say if we're gonna head over to my homepage

02:50.510 --> 02:53.020
I'm going to say you know what I would like to change this.

02:53.030 --> 02:55.670
And I would like to change this to green again.

02:55.850 --> 02:58.990
No specific reason this is just how I feel.

02:59.090 --> 03:06.410
Now what happens though I would like to change the heading ones to all my pages to the next page about

03:06.410 --> 03:09.500
page let's say there is gonna be contact page or whatever.

03:09.740 --> 03:11.870
Then other thousand pages.

03:11.930 --> 03:13.050
Now what happens though.

03:13.220 --> 03:14.480
I go to about email.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.560
What do I see.

03:15.750 --> 03:21.010
You think this is gonna be green or this is gonna be still chocolate well I'm gonna go out here on a

03:21.010 --> 03:27.160
limb and say that this is still gonna be chocolate because within this page where I was styling it as

03:27.160 --> 03:28.510
a chocolate.

03:28.510 --> 03:30.340
So that is probably an issue.

03:30.490 --> 03:33.960
I mean changing one color is no big deal.

03:33.960 --> 03:40.180
But imagine that in general with your styles you're gonna have I don't know thousand lines of code five

03:40.180 --> 03:42.760
hundred lines of code even 30 lines of code.

03:43.360 --> 03:48.040
So what are you going to do each time you're gonna change your mind to some kind of property or the

03:48.040 --> 03:51.580
value you're gonna be jumping all through your pages and changing it.

03:52.240 --> 03:56.620
And what for example happens if you forget what kind of style you need to change.

03:57.040 --> 04:03.170
So then you're gonna have to scour through and I don't know compare them or do something like this now.

04:03.220 --> 04:05.610
Again that doesn't sound very productive to me.

04:06.070 --> 04:07.900
So there has to be a better option.

04:07.960 --> 04:08.630
Okay.

04:08.770 --> 04:12.260
In order to show you the better option first of all let's get rid of these styles.

04:12.410 --> 04:15.830
We don't need them for now we're just gonna get rid of the internal CSF.

04:16.090 --> 04:19.380
Now within the about page as well as the index page.

04:19.880 --> 04:25.720
So let's say we're gonna have no internal success so we're just gonna go again back to the basic H.S.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.690
mold that we already worked before.

04:28.690 --> 04:32.740
Now that better way would be a external CSX.

04:32.770 --> 04:38.390
Now in order to create the external success we would first need to create the CSX file.

04:38.410 --> 04:40.360
Now we can name our CSX file.

04:40.360 --> 04:47.680
However we would like but similarly how we had with index when we needed to have this HDMI extension

04:48.100 --> 04:50.220
the same works we had CSX.

04:50.260 --> 04:56.590
So here if I'm gonna say let's say Stiles CSX and again you can name this Bobby CSX it doesn't really

04:56.590 --> 04:57.380
matter.

04:57.380 --> 05:02.980
There's just some conventions where you say main CSX or styles it says something that would actually

05:03.280 --> 05:03.920
reflect that.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.940
This is something to do with Stiles but the most important thing is here to CSX extension you always

05:09.940 --> 05:12.920
always need to have it if you want to use it the CSA.

05:13.090 --> 05:15.710
Now here again we can write the stars.

05:15.820 --> 05:17.690
Now again let's remember what we had.

05:17.740 --> 05:24.340
So let's say had one and having one let's have just a simple color and let's look for some kind of color

05:24.850 --> 05:26.330
so I could go.

05:26.440 --> 05:27.010
I don't know.

05:27.010 --> 05:31.700
Crimson something like this so I'm not going to add any more font size.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.970
I think it's we already have covered this.

05:33.970 --> 05:36.280
But let's say for I think three.

05:36.380 --> 05:41.430
And then when I say cover this I mean we don't need to add it right now we'll going to cover the syntax.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.990
That doesn't mean that I'm not going to cover what is the font size.

05:44.190 --> 05:49.930
Just as a side note and let's say if we're heading to we're going to add another color let's say color

05:49.930 --> 05:52.000
and I'm going to look this time for yellow.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.870
So I'm going to save the file and surprise surprise.

05:55.870 --> 05:57.370
Nothing happens.

05:57.400 --> 06:01.330
You might be wondering well this dude doesn't know what he's talking about.

06:01.390 --> 06:05.410
We just had a perfectly working CSX and now he just ruined everything.

06:05.920 --> 06:06.870
He deleted it.

06:06.880 --> 06:11.300
He created some funky CSI style and nothing is work.

06:11.890 --> 06:15.030
Well please just wait.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.370
If we're gonna head over to indexation IMHO.

06:17.830 --> 06:23.770
And again within the head element please don't place it somewhere else within the hell it element.

06:23.770 --> 06:30.400
We all gonna have to create a link now with them and if I just type a link notice I'm getting all these

06:30.400 --> 06:31.400
options here.

06:31.480 --> 06:36.250
So what I can do is I can select C assessment which is going to give me right away everything that I'm

06:36.250 --> 06:36.930
looking for.

06:37.200 --> 06:42.880
Now it might be funky sometimes if you have multiple actual files so be careful.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.300
It's gonna give you something automatically.

06:45.310 --> 06:48.370
So again let me head over back with command Zee.

06:48.430 --> 06:53.280
So undo what we just did and instead of maybe see assess we can just look for basic link.

06:53.440 --> 06:59.860
So let me again get me suggestions and within the link notice we're getting the link tag now the link

06:59.860 --> 07:05.650
tag is not going to have a closing tag however we are getting this relationship attribute and this is

07:05.650 --> 07:07.150
gonna point to the story.

07:07.240 --> 07:13.360
So we're saying we would want to link this page to a stat sheet.

07:13.370 --> 07:15.640
Now this is where we would need to go with the path.

07:15.740 --> 07:21.610
And again we have covered this already in nation email where we can have let's say the simple path and

07:21.610 --> 07:26.890
just say styles CFS or we can obviously add here the DOT and such.

07:27.280 --> 07:31.870
And again this is where we're looking within the folder now up to this point is not going to matter

07:31.870 --> 07:33.110
which one you use.

07:33.130 --> 07:37.750
Like I said before later on as you're using the react or node this will gonna matter.

07:37.750 --> 07:40.570
So you might as well get used to it right away.

07:40.570 --> 07:42.800
The actual relative path.

07:43.120 --> 07:48.940
But anyway let's just stay with a simple example and let's say we're looking for stiles Yes knock.

07:49.530 --> 07:52.050
So I'm looking right now and I don't see anything.

07:52.480 --> 07:57.670
The reason why I don't see anything that if I'm actually in the index page where I'm sorry about page

07:58.030 --> 07:59.650
I'm obviously not going to be able to see that.

08:00.130 --> 08:05.650
However if I'm gonna click on the index page so I'm currently at the index page.

08:05.650 --> 08:06.820
Check this out.

08:06.820 --> 08:12.550
So I have all my styles read for one as well as I mean it's annoying probably.

08:12.550 --> 08:14.780
So this was probably a bad choice.

08:14.830 --> 08:16.350
Let's pick another color.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.530
Let's say that we're going to be looking for this guy.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.540
Maybe this is going to be a little bit friendlier too high.

08:21.670 --> 08:25.890
And now we have this scattered blue for my heading to.

08:26.130 --> 08:26.550
OK.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.440
So this is already a good start.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.990
Now what about the about page.

08:30.050 --> 08:34.720
Now we will have to do with the same thing that I had over back to the about page.

08:34.770 --> 08:36.360
I'm going to create a link.

08:36.360 --> 08:44.170
Now again this link is going to have to be the actual element with the relationship attribute that going

08:44.180 --> 08:50.700
to have the value of stat sheet as well as the nature of attribute with where this is located.

08:50.840 --> 08:55.390
And remember and whenever we working with links we're also using this feature attribute.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.400
Check this out just like this here.

08:57.420 --> 08:59.660
So the same way would work over here.

08:59.670 --> 09:04.530
Again we're going to point to the same thing and I'm sorry not main CSX but styles.

09:04.530 --> 09:04.800
Yes.

09:05.460 --> 09:08.130
So once we save it notice what happened.

09:08.130 --> 09:13.480
So if I'm gonna go to a about Page what do you think I'm going to have here.

09:13.620 --> 09:19.380
If we're working more I'm sorry if we're looking at this correctly we noticed that both of them are

09:19.380 --> 09:20.160
exactly the same.

09:20.790 --> 09:22.600
So we have been successful.

09:22.620 --> 09:24.450
Now what does that mean to us.

09:24.450 --> 09:29.610
Well that means that if I'm gonna go here back to the Stiles to assess and if I'm gonna change this

09:29.820 --> 09:36.690
and let's say if I'm gonna go back to I don't know like regular bull color on both pages not only the

09:36.690 --> 09:38.960
about page but also the home page.

09:39.180 --> 09:40.620
These styles are gonna work.

09:40.980 --> 09:47.730
So you can see already how much more productive This is where we can right away work with multiple pages

09:47.900 --> 09:48.250
again.

09:48.480 --> 09:55.320
Let's add maybe a font size font size and let's say this is gonna be for our rams and right away on

09:55.320 --> 09:58.360
both pages and again the last time let me show you that.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.570
This really works on both pages.

10:00.780 --> 10:04.380
They are working so we know we have been successful.

10:04.380 --> 10:10.500
So in general this is going to make your life much more easier if you're using the external sources.

10:10.500 --> 10:15.350
Now one last point that I would like to cover though is this part in a lot of times.

10:15.360 --> 10:20.250
Whenever you're working your styles are going to be in fact in a separate folder because you're going

10:20.250 --> 10:26.550
to have multiple files within your root directory as well as you're going to have multiple CSX.

10:26.550 --> 10:29.450
And it's not a good idea I just have all these files here.

10:29.910 --> 10:34.650
So what you would do in most cases and we're not going to do this throughout the tutorial but throughout

10:34.650 --> 10:40.260
the project we're going to have the folder and then within the folder what's called this folder.

10:40.260 --> 10:45.820
And again it just makes sense leave the folder is gonna be as us and let's grab and copy and paste this

10:45.820 --> 10:46.580
stuff.

10:46.650 --> 10:53.010
Now the moment we do that notice we don't have our styles anymore because the relative path or path

10:53.010 --> 10:54.580
in general matters.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.990
It does matter where you're pointing where it is a reference point.

10:58.500 --> 11:04.170
So let's fix this let's say for relaxation email again we need to look for to see a says folder first.

11:04.310 --> 11:07.970
So I'm going to say we're looking for to see assess and then we're looking for styles.

11:08.060 --> 11:11.080
And again as a side note this is also going to work.

11:11.100 --> 11:17.350
So if I'm gonna say for indexation AML I would have to look for C assessed folder and then more styles

11:17.380 --> 11:19.760
it says now everything is working fine.

11:20.020 --> 11:23.710
And again this is going to work the same way if we're using the relative.

11:23.890 --> 11:27.680
Now let's also check it out in the about the amount.

11:27.750 --> 11:33.780
Again we just need to point to see assess folder and then within the assessors folder we have the style.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.170
Yes.

11:34.680 --> 11:39.750
And this is that we can start using the external stat sheet in our C assess project.
