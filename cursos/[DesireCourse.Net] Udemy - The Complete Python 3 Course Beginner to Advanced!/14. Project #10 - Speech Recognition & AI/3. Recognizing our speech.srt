1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,040
Alright guys, what we're going to be

2

00:00:02,040  -->  00:00:03,179
doing in this video is actually

3

00:00:03,179  -->  00:00:06,240
beginning to record from our audio

4

00:00:06,240  -->  00:00:09,030
source, and so if you're going to be

5

00:00:09,030  -->  00:00:10,980
following along you need to have a

6

00:00:10,980  -->  00:00:13,740
microphone set up to your computer. What

7

00:00:13,740  -->  00:00:15,420
I would recommend is just a simple USB

8

00:00:15,420  -->  00:00:18,270
one. If you have a USB headset with a

9

00:00:18,270  -->  00:00:20,850
microphone on it that would be ideal, if

10

00:00:20,850  -->  00:00:25,109
you don't you might have another kind of

11

00:00:25,109  -->  00:00:28,080
mic, hopefully. Even one of the ones that

12

00:00:28,080  -->  00:00:29,670
comes with an iPhone just that little

13

00:00:29,670  -->  00:00:33,360
you know earpods or ipod ear pods,

14

00:00:33,360  -->  00:00:36,480
whatever they call them, just get some of

15

00:00:36,480  -->  00:00:40,379
those. So, what we need to do in order to

16

00:00:40,379  -->  00:00:45,690
actually record audio and have it

17

00:00:45,690  -->  00:00:48,420
recognized is import

18

00:00:48,420  -->  00:00:56,760
speech_recognition as sr, and we're just

19

00:00:56,760  -->  00:00:58,500
going to be calling sr just to make our

20

00:00:58,500  -->  00:01:02,489
commands a bit quicker. Also, what we

21

00:01:02,489  -->  00:01:04,019
need to do is we want to be able to

22

00:01:04,019  -->  00:01:08,460
speak multiple times, and that's

23

00:01:08,460  -->  00:01:09,930
something we'll cover after, actually.

24

00:01:09,930  -->  00:01:11,610
It's just a matter of putting it into a

25

00:01:11,610  -->  00:01:14,850
loop. So let's go ahead and create a

26

00:01:14,850  -->  00:01:23,970
method called initSpeech, and this is

27

00:01:23,970  -->  00:01:25,080
not going to take any parameters.

28

00:01:25,080  -->  00:01:28,680
Actually, before we even get to that what

29

00:01:28,680  -->  00:01:30,180
we need to do is set our speech

30

00:01:30,180  -->  00:01:32,640
recognizer, and so we're going to say r

31

00:01:32,640  -->  00:01:41,220
equals sr.Recognizer. There we go.

32

00:01:41,220  -->  00:01:44,970
And basically what we need to do with

33

00:01:44,970  -->  00:01:49,170
that r is we need to pass it

34

00:01:49,170  -->  00:01:50,759
what we say into the microphone, and then

35

00:01:50,759  -->  00:01:53,700
it's going to listen to it, and then we

36

00:01:53,700  -->  00:01:55,740
can tell it to recognize what we're

37

00:01:55,740  -->  00:02:00,600
saying. So, let's print out just let us

38

00:02:00,600  -->  00:02:05,100
know that it's working listening, and

39

00:02:05,100  -->  00:02:09,380
then here we're actually going to start

40

00:02:09,590  -->  00:02:15,170
our recording. So gonna copy this because

41

00:02:15,170  -->  00:02:22,220
we're going to be using that to tell us

42

00:02:22,220  -->  00:02:25,010
that it's actually initiated so initiate,

43

00:02:25,010  -->  00:02:27,349
and again if you guys watch the last

44

00:02:27,349  -->  00:02:29,480
video you know you need to go ahead and

45

00:02:29,480  -->  00:02:31,400
get some wave files. Even if you get mp3

46

00:02:31,400  -->  00:02:34,610
files there are ways to convert mp3s to

47

00:02:34,610  -->  00:02:38,269
wav, and I'm pretty sure miro audio

48

00:02:38,269  -->  00:02:41,870
converter is a really good one. We could

49

00:02:41,870  -->  00:02:45,290
also actually discuss converting audio

50

00:02:45,290  -->  00:02:48,200
using Python, but that's not something we're

51

00:02:48,200  -->  00:02:50,000
going to do right now. So you guys can

52

00:02:50,000  -->  00:02:51,950
go ahead and download Miro if you need

53

00:02:51,950  -->  00:02:56,900
to, otherwise just follow along. So as

54

00:02:56,900  -->  00:02:58,099
soon as we call this it's going to say

55

00:02:58,099  -->  00:02:59,450
listening and then it's going to play

56

00:02:59,450  -->  00:03:01,430
the audio that tells us it's listening,

57

00:03:01,430  -->  00:03:07,190
and then we're going to say with

58

00:03:07,190  -->  00:03:20,720
sr.Microphone as source, we're going to say

59

00:03:20,720  -->  00:03:27,290
print "Say Something," and then under here

60

00:03:27,290  -->  00:03:30,380
we're just going to capture audio equals

61

00:03:30,380  -->  00:03:35,870
r.listen, and it's going to listen to

62

00:03:35,870  -->  00:03:38,810
the source. So again this is basically

63

00:03:38,810  -->  00:03:41,030
just saying our recognizer is now

64

00:03:41,030  -->  00:03:43,819
listening to whatever we're saying. So

65

00:03:43,819  -->  00:03:45,260
it's coming through the microphone here

66

00:03:45,260  -->  00:03:47,329
and we're calling it source so this

67

00:03:47,329  -->  00:03:49,040
essentially is whatever we're saying, and

68

00:03:49,040  -->  00:03:50,870
then the audio is going to listen to it.

69

00:03:50,870  -->  00:03:54,859
And that's all we need to do to actually

70

00:03:54,859  -->  00:03:57,349
record our audio. So what we're going to

71

00:03:57,349  -->  00:03:58,790
do at this point is we're going to play

72

00:03:58,790  -->  00:04:01,099
audio, and we're going to play the ending

73

00:04:01,099  -->  00:04:09,319
sound. So audio/audio_end.wav and this is

74

00:04:09,319  -->  00:04:12,889
going to tell us that we've finished

75

00:04:12,889  -->  00:04:14,930
speaking, and now we're going to create a

76

00:04:14,930  -->  00:04:16,940
variable called command which is going

77

00:04:16,940  -->  00:04:19,729
to be an empty string right now, and then

78

00:04:19,729  -->  00:04:23,090
we're going to

79

00:04:23,090  -->  00:04:27,410
use a try except method here and this

80

00:04:27,410  -->  00:04:29,960
is going to basically just be a fail

81

00:04:29,960  -->  00:04:33,860
safe for if the recognizer could

82

00:04:33,860  -->  00:04:36,530
not understand what we were saying. Let's

83

00:04:36,530  -->  00:04:39,650
go ahead and try and we're going to set

84

00:04:39,650  -->  00:04:45,410
command equal to r.recognize_google,

85

00:04:45,410  -->  00:04:48,680
and this is going to use google to

86

00:04:48,680  -->  00:04:50,750
determine what we're saying. There

87

00:04:50,750  -->  00:04:52,100
are different things that you could use

88

00:04:52,100  -->  00:04:54,919
here as you just saw. You can use bing,

89

00:04:54,919  -->  00:04:57,979
houndify, ibm, sphinx, etc., and we will

90

00:04:57,979  -->  00:05:00,800
actually get into sphinx as well and maybe

91

00:05:00,800  -->  00:05:03,470
wit, but for right now we're just using

92

00:05:03,470  -->  00:05:05,930
google, and we're going to pass in our

93

00:05:05,930  -->  00:05:08,450
audio. So again the audio is captured

94

00:05:08,450  -->  00:05:11,090
here as to what ever is listened to, and

95

00:05:11,090  -->  00:05:14,330
then we send the audio over to google, it

96

00:05:14,330  -->  00:05:17,000
puts it into this command variable,

97

00:05:17,000  -->  00:05:19,310
and so then at that point we could print

98

00:05:19,310  -->  00:05:21,289
out what we've said. So let's go ahead

99

00:05:21,289  -->  00:05:26,180
and use the except methods here or not

100

00:05:26,180  -->  00:05:31,729
methods but conditions, so print

101

00:05:31,729  -->  00:05:42,500
"Couldn't understand you, bro." And then

102

00:05:42,500  -->  00:05:45,200
under here what we're going to do is

103

00:05:45,200  -->  00:05:48,650
we're going to just say, we're just going

104

00:05:48,650  -->  00:05:51,830
to print back what we've said. So, print

105

00:05:51,830  -->  00:06:02,870
"Your command:" and then command, and that

106

00:06:02,870  -->  00:06:04,910
is it. So, let's go ahead and save this,

107

00:06:04,910  -->  00:06:08,389
and now let's run it, and I'm going to speak

108

00:06:08,389  -->  00:06:10,130
and what we should see is that whatever

109

00:06:10,130  -->  00:06:15,950
I speak gets printed down here.

110

00:06:15,950  -->  00:06:17,479
Right, we didn't call that method,

111

00:06:17,479  -->  00:06:24,349
actually. So, initSpeech. There we go. My

112

00:06:24,349  -->  00:06:27,160
name is Nick,

113

00:06:29,300  -->  00:06:32,419
and it spelled Nik wrong, but it did catch

114

00:06:32,419  -->  00:06:33,830
it. So let's go through something a

115

00:06:33,830  -->  00:06:35,870
little more difficult and you didn't

116

00:06:35,870  -->  00:06:38,539
hear it but it did use the beginning and

117

00:06:38,539  -->  00:06:41,300
ending audio file exactly when it

118

00:06:41,300  -->  00:06:42,830
showed up, so that's pretty neat. You guys

119

00:06:42,830  -->  00:06:45,110
should have the exact same result so you

120

00:06:45,110  -->  00:06:48,560
guys will hear when you're doing it. So

121

00:06:48,560  -->  00:06:50,090
thank you guys for watching this video,

122

00:06:50,090  -->  00:06:51,740
in the next video we're actually going

123

00:06:51,740  -->  00:06:54,229
to be getting into actually

124

00:06:54,229  -->  00:06:55,940
understanding what we're saying and be

125

00:06:55,940  -->  00:06:58,460
able to launch certain actions from

126

00:06:58,460  -->  00:07:01,150
what we're saying.
