00:00.100 --> 00:03.650
And there's always first let's check it out when we have.

00:03.680 --> 00:09.000
All right so this is how we would look like without being responsive all spanning all across the screen

00:09.860 --> 00:11.070
or here would you have to say.

00:11.070 --> 00:14.570
This is going to be me on your screen here.

00:14.850 --> 00:23.560
And then we're going to and and I know you're going to say men with you then this is going to be a 776.

00:23.580 --> 00:29.670
So I'm going to say seven hundred seventy six pixels here and then we're going to say that this is going

00:29.670 --> 00:36.440
to be a contact center again it's data value.

00:36.480 --> 00:44.100
And then this guy is going to be display flex here and then we're going to have a justified content

00:44.910 --> 00:46.330
space between.

00:46.710 --> 00:54.110
And then we're going to have a flex on him wrap and this is going to be a wrap here.

00:54.150 --> 00:57.400
Now that we have this now I would want any info.

00:57.480 --> 00:58.200
All right.

00:58.210 --> 01:00.810
I would actually would want to style them right.

01:00.850 --> 01:09.660
So over here what I'm going to say that this is going to be a company for first some say the company

01:10.790 --> 01:11.540
info.

01:11.670 --> 01:14.820
So this is going to be the first of our articles.

01:15.120 --> 01:22.970
And over here I'm going to say this is going to be flex 00 and this is going to be calque again and

01:23.080 --> 01:30.730
here we're going to say 50 percent minus 5 or 10 pixels something like this.

01:30.750 --> 01:31.700
Right.

01:31.710 --> 01:35.610
And then after that what you want is actually a customer in full.

01:35.760 --> 01:46.350
So we're going to have a copy and paste here and say customer and company customer or here now we say

01:46.350 --> 01:48.260
this you're doing this.

01:48.540 --> 01:50.380
Let's just check it out what we have.

01:50.880 --> 01:54.490
So once we are fresh I think this is where we're going to have.

01:55.100 --> 01:59.070
So this guys over here is going to be your address or phone number or e-mail.

01:59.100 --> 01:59.780
Right.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.650
I know this is going to be the forum.

02:01.730 --> 02:02.210
Right.

02:02.390 --> 02:02.720
All right.

02:02.760 --> 02:06.980
