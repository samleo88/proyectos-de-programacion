WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:02.500
So we're going to go back to our index page.

00:02.520 --> 00:08.780
You know I too are going to look at where our top nav ends really miss.

00:08.820 --> 00:12.560
And then we're going to create a section of song list.

00:12.840 --> 00:18.870
So we're going to see or hear song list and or here we're going to say this is going to be a section

00:19.950 --> 00:20.730
on here.

00:20.780 --> 00:25.690
Then the class is going to be song list here.

00:25.760 --> 00:30.070
Then once we have the song what's going on here we're going to say having one and then we're all going

00:30.070 --> 00:32.260
to say song West or here like this.

00:32.270 --> 00:33.040
Right.

00:33.190 --> 00:40.750
Once we have this now I would want to create a div which is going to have a class of song list.

00:40.850 --> 00:42.150
Center.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.480
Center over here.

00:44.940 --> 00:52.650
Then out there we have a song lists and they're now going to create a new article or article and that's

00:52.650 --> 00:54.310
going to be a list item.

00:54.420 --> 01:00.070
So we're going to say a list item here first time and then once in an article.

01:00.240 --> 01:09.590
Now would want a div with a list item and I'm going to say the image this is going to be our class.

01:09.660 --> 01:15.380
Then in this day of actually going to place our image right so them say we're here.

01:15.400 --> 01:23.340
This is going to be Image sources going to be Image song one out here like this right here we're going

01:23.340 --> 01:25.550
to just say this is going to be song.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.250
And then after that we would want to text.

01:28.280 --> 01:28.590
All right.

01:28.590 --> 01:37.140
So if this is the last item on here we're going to create a list I had him text first time once we have

01:37.140 --> 01:37.850
the div..

01:37.910 --> 01:39.650
So this is going to be heading three.

01:39.780 --> 01:45.520
This is going to be artist then we're going to have a song.

01:45.770 --> 01:47.890
So we're going to say he's heading for.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.330
It's going to be so long.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.610
Then we're going to have a deal.

01:52.060 --> 01:55.300
And that there is going to have all these Fonte awesome icons.

01:55.300 --> 01:55.930
Right.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.520
So we're going to create O'Hare.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.910
So you need four five font awesome icons.

02:01.090 --> 02:10.850
So we're going to say here and this is going to be a big with list item here icon icon over here.

02:11.260 --> 02:17.450
And once we have the list on then over here we're going to say that this is going to be spanne when

02:17.610 --> 02:18.930
you're doing this.

02:19.210 --> 02:25.720
Instead we're going to say this is going to be a and it's an FAA star on here.

02:25.790 --> 02:26.520
That's right.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.280
So this is going to be number one.

02:28.290 --> 02:34.360
Now what are we going to do is we're going to copy and paste this one two three and the one.

02:34.460 --> 02:36.770
But here we're going to change it to our right.

02:36.780 --> 02:38.030
So this is going to be like this.

02:38.040 --> 02:38.220
Right.

02:38.220 --> 02:39.940
So this is going to be the empty one.

02:40.110 --> 02:43.760
Now we need to check where this article ends.

02:43.970 --> 02:44.380
Right.

02:44.410 --> 02:50.370
This was one article the second one what we would want is copy and paste this nine times right.

02:50.530 --> 02:52.580
Well eight times and nine total.

02:52.620 --> 02:58.220
One two three four five six seven eight.

02:58.400 --> 02:58.650
Right.

02:58.660 --> 03:04.920
And now all we need to do is actually change what would be the image right over here.

03:04.920 --> 03:10.740
We need to look where is the list item on this list item number one.

03:11.100 --> 03:17.920
Then this is going to be some number two then we'll have a song number three.

03:17.940 --> 03:34.980
This is going to be a song five four sorry than five here six and seven eight and nine eight and out

03:34.980 --> 03:36.380
here this is going to be nice.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.400
All right.

03:37.740 --> 03:46.220
So once we have this let's go actually to Main she and let's style this or here song list and everything.

03:46.220 --> 03:47.010
All right.

03:47.010 --> 03:47.830
So let's go.

03:47.880 --> 03:50.470
We're here to make sense.

03:50.800 --> 03:54.000
We can maybe save the next actually.

03:54.030 --> 03:57.550
I'll go all the way to the bottom here.

03:57.610 --> 03:58.630
That's right.

03:58.660 --> 04:02.010
And that's a song list.

04:02.160 --> 04:10.980
So this is going to be a long list or then press hashtags over here and then over here first we're going

04:10.980 --> 04:14.750
to say is for the song list.

04:14.980 --> 04:23.620
We're going to have a padding of 20 pixels or 20 pixels all around then we'll fill the list item to

04:23.880 --> 04:29.320
say list item here what we would want to write first.

04:29.330 --> 04:37.840
We're going to say margin and I'm going to say 20 pixels or here in between an 0 left and right then

04:37.840 --> 04:40.160
we're going to save this play more here.

04:40.180 --> 04:43.410
Steinem will say flex like this.

04:43.430 --> 04:43.990
Right.

04:44.050 --> 04:47.810
So each one of them is actually going to be displayed flex right.

04:47.890 --> 04:56.440
So we have the imagine all this is going to be the text then out here for a list item image I want to

04:56.440 --> 05:04.270
say with is going to be 150 pixels on healing this then margin right.

05:04.300 --> 05:09.160
It's going to be 20 pixels in this border radius.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.360
We're going to say 20 pixels.

05:11.420 --> 05:16.680
Right so we're going to make these around edges or here and then we would want to work with the spam

05:16.790 --> 05:17.230
icon.

05:17.270 --> 05:18.000
Right.

05:18.010 --> 05:27.010
So we're going to say a list item I can span for this part and what I would want is a color and we're

05:27.010 --> 05:28.830
going to use the yellow color.

05:28.980 --> 05:35.730
Right so this is going to be F 3 C and 0 F A.

05:36.010 --> 05:37.540
I don't realize this right.

05:37.560 --> 05:42.710
So now you can see that I don't have the song number nine.

05:42.790 --> 05:43.940
So let me check this.

05:43.980 --> 05:44.460
All right.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.310
I have only eight.

05:45.310 --> 05:49.190
So let's play sexually let's say Song number one the last.

05:49.190 --> 05:49.710
All right.

05:49.990 --> 05:54.690
So I guess I was lazy to get nine of them right or I was just playing that one or here.

05:55.030 --> 05:58.250
So I will say this and say this one over here.

05:58.720 --> 06:04.290
And now what you would want to do is add your immediate Querrey right.

06:04.510 --> 06:12.750
So I'm going to say are reading this we're going to say this is going to be a media media screen here

06:12.940 --> 06:21.710
and we're going to say that this is going to be and this man with one here.

06:21.750 --> 06:24.820
And this is going to be 576 pixels.

06:24.940 --> 06:25.190
Right.

06:25.230 --> 06:32.850
And what should happen when I hear the song lists and their song list and we're all going to say Center

06:33.600 --> 06:34.290
here.

06:34.320 --> 06:41.790
We're going to say that there's going to be a display of flex display flex here like this then flex

06:42.630 --> 06:52.240
rap which is fine whereas flex rap you're going to say rap like this and say Just if I can't space between

06:52.900 --> 06:54.290
spaces between right.

06:54.370 --> 06:54.730
Right.

06:54.880 --> 07:00.970
So say this one over here and now we're going to go maybe we can close this one over here and let's

07:00.970 --> 07:03.030
go ahead and let's have a look what we have.

07:03.030 --> 07:03.590
Right.

07:03.610 --> 07:10.250
So we refresh right now I can see that as I'm actually getting bigger right now I have all nine of them.

07:10.310 --> 07:11.190
All right.

07:11.440 --> 07:16.540
As I continue right as I got on the smaller screen right now this is the look that we have right.

07:16.650 --> 07:18.190
We've got them the small screen.

07:18.350 --> 07:18.890
Right.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.600
And then we have all here in general.

07:21.610 --> 07:24.220
One last item on here like this right.

07:24.340 --> 07:26.080
If we're going to go to the bigger one.

07:26.100 --> 07:26.370
All right.

07:26.380 --> 07:28.000
This is how it's going to look like.

07:28.030 --> 07:32.130
Now the one thing I maybe with this heading three and heading for.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.290
So let's go check.

07:33.310 --> 07:35.890
And what is the indexation now.

07:36.010 --> 07:36.540
Right.

07:36.550 --> 07:43.850
And let's see this is list item text heading 3 heading for so list item text here knowing this.

07:43.880 --> 07:49.460
So this is going to be a list item text here.

07:49.550 --> 07:55.900
And let's say hitting three and say text here transform.

07:56.060 --> 07:59.160
When to say capitalize on hearing this right.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.990
And for the last item heading forward we're going to say how prickers.

08:03.120 --> 08:07.850
So let's copy and paste this at a heading for.

08:07.920 --> 08:14.070
Or you're right uppercase so uppercase over line that's right so we have an artist and this is going

08:14.070 --> 08:22.590
to be a song and maybe just to be a little bit more collected say margin bottom 10 pixels or like this.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.080
Right now we have a song and then we have an artist.

08:26.080 --> 08:32.860
So now we are ready to move on and work on our last section right which is going to be our Here are

08:32.920 --> 08:33.770
our cars.

08:33.770 --> 08:36.360
All right so if we're going to go back over here.

08:36.550 --> 08:36.820
Right.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.770
We actually have a Alcaraz.

08:38.760 --> 08:39.590
All right.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.040
So let's go and start working on that.
