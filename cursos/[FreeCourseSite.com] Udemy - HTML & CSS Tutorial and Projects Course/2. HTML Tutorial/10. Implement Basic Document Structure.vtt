WEBVTT

00:00.530 --> 00:06.680
Now that we are big shots and we know the basic age the AML document structure let's implement that

00:06.680 --> 00:07.970
in our page.

00:08.150 --> 00:13.100
First of all let me just get rid of this head in one paragraph because we're going to redo this anyway.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.660
And let's start with our doctor.

00:15.140 --> 00:21.570
So here we're going to declare what version of HMO the use and an arc is that's gonna be interesting.

00:21.590 --> 00:26.390
0 5 as you can see right away Visual Studio code gives you suggestion.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.560
It's like Hey listen do you want a doctor.

00:28.970 --> 00:30.210
And sure enough we do.

00:30.290 --> 00:31.730
Again this is not cheating.

00:31.730 --> 00:33.260
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:33.310 --> 00:35.840
This will gonna save you a lot of time in the long run.

00:36.420 --> 00:39.530
Now next we'll have HDMI root element again.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.600
Let me get over all caps.

00:41.630 --> 00:44.650
No no we're gonna write each demo now within the email.

00:44.650 --> 00:50.930
Remember we had the ED element and within the head element we can right away place the title again title

00:50.930 --> 00:54.950
is just gonna be where the title of the page is gonna be displayed.

00:55.520 --> 01:02.750
So here we're gonna say first that first that first web page and then let's go right away to the body

01:03.260 --> 01:08.150
and let's write within the body there's gonna be two more things heading one is gonna be.

01:08.150 --> 01:11.600
Hello my name is John or whatever name you there with the right.

01:11.600 --> 01:11.870
Right.

01:12.280 --> 01:20.360
So hello my name is John and then I'm gonna write I know in a paragraph and this is my first webpage

01:20.690 --> 01:26.740
and this is my first web page.

01:26.960 --> 01:31.990
Now once I'm going to save it nothing is gonna change right now because we still would need to restart

01:31.990 --> 01:37.620
the server because now we do have the proper actual page structure or document structure.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.940
So let me do this.

01:38.950 --> 01:44.130
Let me just go over to the port and click on disposing it so I can see it.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.100
Gonna say that server is gonna be online.

01:46.110 --> 01:47.440
Okay fair enough.

01:47.530 --> 01:49.890
And then let's go live in the moment.

01:49.900 --> 01:50.710
I'm gonna go live.

01:50.710 --> 01:56.720
Not as this is gonna be my page with the title here at the very top so I can close this tab.

01:56.750 --> 02:02.830
And now let's test it out whether live server is working properly where we can type something and the

02:02.830 --> 02:09.280
moment we're gonna save it the changes are gonna be displayed live in a live server or in dev server

02:09.280 --> 02:09.630
sorry.

02:10.090 --> 02:17.180
So let's say this is my first page and it is very good.

02:17.370 --> 02:21.610
And let's add a bunch of exclamation marks here and let's save this.

02:22.030 --> 02:23.420
And sure enough the moment we save it.

02:23.410 --> 02:24.760
Notice what happens.

02:24.760 --> 02:29.980
So all the changes were being displayed right away here on a life server.

02:30.040 --> 02:36.400
So what's happening again is we don't need to go and refresh because live server is doing for us.

02:36.610 --> 02:39.430
So development server is working hard.

02:39.580 --> 02:42.480
So we have to law work less hard.

02:42.540 --> 02:48.700
I also like to right away show you that with a dev server with the lives of we have an option of right

02:48.700 --> 02:53.000
away where we every time we're gonna be working there's gonna be changes this way.

02:53.290 --> 02:55.150
And for this we have also.

02:55.350 --> 02:56.140
So let's do this.

02:56.230 --> 02:56.710
This guy.

02:57.050 --> 03:01.510
And then every time we're gonna be typing something it will in fact gonna be displayed right away in

03:01.510 --> 03:01.940
a page.

03:02.410 --> 03:04.990
So let's say after the won I'm gonna add another one.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.360
So as I'm starting to type notice what happens in the life server.

03:09.360 --> 03:13.080
So in this case we don't need the need to save anything.

03:13.270 --> 03:18.250
The moment we're gonna be typing something we're adding something the changes are gonna be displayed

03:18.250 --> 03:18.550
like.

03:19.150 --> 03:24.450
However I do find it a little bit annoying especially when you start working on when things like Javascript.

03:24.550 --> 03:26.880
So I usually have my went off.

03:26.950 --> 03:32.550
Now it's really up to you whether you'd like to prefer to work or for this tutorial.

03:32.550 --> 03:34.320
I've always going to have my one off.

03:34.690 --> 03:39.830
So first I'm gonna make the changes and then I'm going to save the changes and then they're all gonna

03:39.850 --> 03:42.730
be displayed here on the page.

03:42.740 --> 03:45.980
Also I'd like to talk about how the tags are nested.

03:46.210 --> 03:51.820
So as you notice we have the H email and each team now would be a growth element and then we have two

03:51.820 --> 03:52.620
children.

03:52.720 --> 03:57.850
And the reason why they're called children they're sitting within this age the email element.

03:57.850 --> 04:02.070
Now the two children are a hard element as well as the body.

04:02.740 --> 04:08.470
Now it is important to keep the syntax because this will not going to make sense if you have a child

04:08.470 --> 04:09.450
within the head element.

04:09.910 --> 04:15.920
And then let's say the closing tag of this title is gonna be removed and placed let's say outside the

04:15.940 --> 04:22.330
head element you always need to follow the structure where if you have the element and if you nest something

04:22.330 --> 04:26.490
within this element more sandwich or whatever however you'd like to call it.

04:26.560 --> 04:31.890
It's important that the closing tag also is going to be sitting within the same element.

04:32.290 --> 04:37.860
Now the same would work here in the body if let's say I would get rid of this closing tag for my heading

04:37.900 --> 04:41.840
one and place it and so on the body or even outside the email.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.370
It will not gonna make sense.

04:43.810 --> 04:47.630
So this is something also you should remember about children and parent.

04:48.070 --> 04:54.880
So the parent is gonna be the parent element where the child is sick and as you can see a child can

04:54.880 --> 04:58.730
also can have multiple or one other child on.

04:59.050 --> 05:05.430
So even though the head is the child of the normal it can have the child on its own meaning the title

05:05.430 --> 05:08.580
element in this case would be the child of the head.

05:08.590 --> 05:15.190
Now I know it might sound foreign with children and parents everything but just remember that is important

05:15.190 --> 05:22.660
to follow the syntax where if you are placing something within the element make sure that elements closing

05:22.660 --> 05:28.900
tag and opening tag are actually sitting within this element and the same would go here don't mix.

05:28.900 --> 05:35.800
Let's say heading one with paragraph don't place the closing tag for the heading One within this paragraph

05:36.010 --> 05:39.490
because again you're going to get errors and it will not going to make sense.
