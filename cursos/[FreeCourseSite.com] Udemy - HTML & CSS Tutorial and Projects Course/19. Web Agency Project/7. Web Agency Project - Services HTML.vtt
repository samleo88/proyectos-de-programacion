WEBVTT

00:00.290 --> 00:04.810
And the next section we're going to be creating here this is going to be disservices action.

00:04.890 --> 00:05.140
Right.

00:05.190 --> 00:07.680
So there's going to be two things that are going to be looking at.

00:07.680 --> 00:11.920
Obviously I want to put it in the center and we're going to look at see a system move this text up a

00:11.920 --> 00:12.490
noun.

00:12.690 --> 00:15.050
And they're also going to be changing the order.

00:15.100 --> 00:15.520
All right.

00:15.690 --> 00:19.920
So let's go to the next page to him now or here in our file.

00:19.980 --> 00:22.900
And this was the end of the skills section right now.

00:22.930 --> 00:23.730
Two comments.

00:23.810 --> 00:24.670
You can see better.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.060
I overdo it.

00:26.220 --> 00:26.670
Right.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.370
And this is going to be.

00:28.450 --> 00:30.890
First one is going to be services section right.

00:31.090 --> 00:35.780
And the services section is also going to have the title read the title the role going to be actually

00:35.780 --> 00:36.390
reusing.

00:36.390 --> 00:37.020
Right.

00:37.020 --> 00:43.970
So we're all going to say services section know like this and then we're going to say the end of services.

00:43.980 --> 00:49.660
Right and of services services.

00:49.910 --> 00:50.420
Right.

00:50.460 --> 01:00.040
So now that we have this we will want a section here section with an ID of services services right.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.760
Once we have that the first thing we're going to do is actually place a title.

01:03.910 --> 01:04.380
Right.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.150
So I'm going to say we're here to come and this is going to be tied up.

01:07.440 --> 01:11.520
And this is going to be the end of title because we're going to be using title.

01:11.510 --> 01:19.230
So I'm going to say end of title and tired of all this and then I'm going to have a div with a class

01:19.230 --> 01:29.110
of title title tied to all this and then I'm going to have a title text is going to be another day I

01:29.180 --> 01:31.810
don't text here.

01:31.950 --> 01:35.820
And then with an intro text we're going to have heading one and we're going to say this is going to

01:35.820 --> 01:44.820
be services service you know and this and I pressed in the wrong space so we're here to press now we

01:44.820 --> 01:46.030
have services right.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.820
And then we'll have a title on the line right here.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.290
This is separate.

01:51.290 --> 01:51.570
Right.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.470
And then we're going to have a div of title on the line.

01:55.750 --> 02:05.370
I know there's a line over here and then we're going to have pretty much the end of the horror title.

02:05.370 --> 02:05.930
All right.

02:05.940 --> 02:07.450
So you have the title right.

02:07.460 --> 02:11.800
Then we have thunder on the line and this is going to be a title text right.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.800
So here this is going to be the end of title.

02:13.830 --> 02:16.130
Now we can start creating the sections.

02:16.140 --> 02:16.730
Right.

02:16.800 --> 02:21.780
So we're here we're going to say this is going to be first of all Dave and this is going to be services

02:21.780 --> 02:28.490
container services container container or here.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.180
And then within this day we're going to have articles right.

02:31.380 --> 02:35.550
And the first article right we're going to say this is going to be our logo and then we're going to

02:35.550 --> 02:36.910
have the end of article.

02:36.990 --> 02:37.200
Right.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.690
So what we're going to do is just copy and paste this.

02:39.810 --> 02:42.200
I'm going to say end of article right.

02:42.240 --> 02:48.660
And as we go over here we're going to have an element of article we're all going to have a class of

02:48.660 --> 02:57.230
service Irom I had them on here like this and or here there's going to be a lot of class service I had

02:57.240 --> 02:58.830
on black.

02:58.980 --> 02:59.440
Right.

02:59.640 --> 03:03.170
So we're going to change this one around for a great one.

03:03.180 --> 03:03.510
Right.

03:03.510 --> 03:05.090
And this is going to be white instead.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.890
But for this one this is going to be black.

03:06.900 --> 03:07.620
Right.

03:07.620 --> 03:11.300
And once we have the article set up let's go here.

03:11.370 --> 03:15.660
And first we're going to create a div with a class of front text right.

03:15.660 --> 03:17.200
So that's going to appear from.

03:17.220 --> 03:17.880
Right.

03:17.880 --> 03:18.960
So we have the day.

03:19.220 --> 03:24.810
And so here we're going to say this is going to be an eye for rear fog here.

03:25.270 --> 03:31.230
So this is going to be phantasm from gears here and this and that we're going to have a heading one

03:31.550 --> 03:33.020
so we're here.

03:33.020 --> 03:37.920
We're going to say this is going to be heading one and we're going to say this is going to be web development

03:39.090 --> 03:41.120
or healing this press time.

03:41.130 --> 03:46.950
Now we have had one and this is going to be it for the Frontex right now here we need to create a back

03:46.950 --> 03:47.820
text right.

03:47.990 --> 03:51.920
That's going to going in up here once we're actually hovering right.

03:52.070 --> 03:58.350
So here Dave and this is going to be back next hour here and I'm going to say this is going to be hunting

03:58.350 --> 04:02.300
one and this is also going to be web development right.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.970
Web Developer love man.

04:05.560 --> 04:09.630
Here again press time and we have one right here.

04:09.630 --> 04:11.910
We're going to place the actual paragraph right.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.280
So here let's make this bigger a little bit.

04:14.280 --> 04:14.720
Right.

04:14.910 --> 04:22.420
So paragraph and within the paragraph again we're going to say let's say Lauren 15 or 15 words you know

04:22.440 --> 04:28.270
here you can see that if I press type again now I have my paragraph and then I'm going to have a button.

04:28.390 --> 04:30.130
Right so here I'm going to say.

04:30.350 --> 04:38.250
And this is going to have a type or your type button and then this is going to be read more read or

04:38.440 --> 04:39.600
hear more.

04:39.690 --> 04:40.070
Right.

04:40.200 --> 04:45.240
So now we have a Frontex and the back text and we have the whole article right.

04:45.390 --> 04:46.980
So let's check it out where it ends.

04:46.980 --> 04:52.260
Right so this is the end of the article so I'm going to grab together with a comment and I need three

04:52.260 --> 04:52.660
more.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.550
One two three.

04:54.630 --> 04:55.390
Right.

04:55.890 --> 05:00.680
So I would want to do here create a new line and I'm going to check it out.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.450
What is different in the next door.

05:02.500 --> 05:02.930
Right.

05:03.110 --> 05:09.590
So first of all in the next one to me I'm black it's going to be actually I'm white.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.570
So this is the first difference.

05:11.690 --> 05:18.850
Well here we're going to ride actually design and branding design over here and branding.

05:19.010 --> 05:25.070
So we're going to find where it is here and we're going to say branding and then we're going to have

05:25.070 --> 05:28.820
pencil square hole on here instead of gears.

05:29.000 --> 05:37.250
So we're going to say for so here's where we're here we're going to say oh my.

05:37.430 --> 05:41.590
So now we have this font or some analysis say we need to change this guy to.

05:41.630 --> 05:42.100
Right.

05:42.290 --> 05:49.150
So here I'm just going to copy this one design and branding copy and we're going to delete this guy

05:50.360 --> 05:52.250
and we're going to paste this one right.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.230
So now we have the design and branding.

05:54.230 --> 06:02.180
Next one is going to be service item black here and then it's going to have a pie chart as a phone or

06:02.180 --> 06:05.900
some pie chart.

06:05.900 --> 06:11.930
And then this one is not going to be web development this is actually going to be analytics and analytics

06:12.360 --> 06:13.470
or here.

06:13.640 --> 06:19.330
And then the next one is going to be a service item again.

06:19.780 --> 06:25.590
So this is going to be white or heatless maybe change this one to analytics too.

06:26.110 --> 06:33.500
So now we have this copy this guy there's a guy here and paste.

06:33.510 --> 06:38.300
And then once we have the analytics the last one is going to be CEO and this is going to be following

06:38.310 --> 06:40.550
chart over here.

06:40.550 --> 06:40.870
All right.

06:40.870 --> 06:45.550
Follow the line line chart right.

06:45.610 --> 06:49.960
And all he'll going to run this is going to be CEO CEO.

06:50.090 --> 06:51.430

06:51.610 --> 06:55.150
And right as am I right.

06:55.380 --> 07:02.250
So again let's grab this one copy this one and paste this one over here.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.180
We have text white text black.

07:04.180 --> 07:04.590

07:04.770 --> 07:06.980
And this is going to be it for the hour.
