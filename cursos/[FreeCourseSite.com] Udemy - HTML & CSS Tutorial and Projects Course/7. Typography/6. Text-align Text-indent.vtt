00:00.510 --> 00:04.290
Since I mentioned it in the previous video why don't we check it out.

00:04.290 --> 00:05.330
Also right away.

00:05.330 --> 00:11.280
Text align property as well as text and then with your permission I would like to get rid of these font

00:11.280 --> 00:17.340
styles because this is annoying me a little but when I have all these selections I'm still gonna keep

00:17.340 --> 00:23.490
here and the selectors and curly braces but I'm just gonna give her the properties as well as the values

00:24.240 --> 00:29.180
I was going to delete them and now was gonna have a normal text now for text the line.

00:29.190 --> 00:30.390
What's gonna happen.

00:30.390 --> 00:33.700
Well we're gonna be able to control the alignment of the text.

00:33.840 --> 00:38.540
Now we can start very simply by the whole body and just save for the whole body.

00:38.560 --> 00:47.310
We would like to text to line it in the center or we can do left or so let's do the center one first.

00:47.310 --> 00:49.880
She's always gonna place that text in the center.

00:49.890 --> 00:53.770
Now I can maybe make my browser window with bigger.

00:53.820 --> 00:54.690
You can see right now.

00:54.690 --> 00:57.760
The text has been placed in the center.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.780
Now similarly if I'm gonna go text the line right.

01:00.990 --> 01:03.120
This is gonna place it all the way to the right.

01:03.390 --> 01:08.310
Now here I would like to again show you where we would use the normal one which wouldn't be the left

01:08.310 --> 01:10.060
one meaning the default.

01:10.380 --> 01:13.520
Because right now on us we have the text the line on the left.

01:13.770 --> 01:15.480
Wonder if I'm gonna comment this out.

01:15.490 --> 01:20.390
Nothing is going to change because this comes preset with browser icon.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.540
We can just delete this.

01:21.540 --> 01:29.330
Maybe this guy here and let's just again the same thing that for the whole text or whole body.

01:29.460 --> 01:35.340
I'M GONNA LINE IT TO THE RIGHT ALL MY headings so let's say my main one or you know what.

01:35.340 --> 01:41.560
Not all of them maybe the main one I'm gonna line it in the center say text align center.

01:41.710 --> 01:45.000
So this hearing the first one main one is gonna be the center.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.580
And let's say for both of the paragraphs.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.180
Well you know what.

01:48.180 --> 01:49.520
No I'm just lazy.

01:49.530 --> 01:53.810
Let's just write for the second paragraph I'm gonna place it all the way to the left.

01:53.940 --> 01:58.240
So we're gonna write text the line and this is gonna be on the right hand side.

01:58.530 --> 01:58.980
Or you know what.

01:58.980 --> 02:01.840
Not right inside and that's obviously coming from the body.

02:01.890 --> 02:04.630
Here we're gonna use the default one which would be the left.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.850
Now again this would be the case where we would use it.

02:07.290 --> 02:13.380
So if you're applying some kind of property either right or center in this case then if you would want

02:13.380 --> 02:16.890
to go for default one you would use text a line left.

02:16.890 --> 02:22.140
Now if you're not doing that there's no need for using the text line left because this is already preset

02:22.140 --> 02:22.670
for you.

02:22.980 --> 02:28.840
And we have text in that and maybe let's practice on this paragraph and that would basically indent

02:28.850 --> 02:31.850
the first line it accepts multiple values.

02:31.860 --> 02:38.160
We all just gonna use pixels but we can also look at our games let's say text and that was the property

02:38.160 --> 02:43.220
name intent and the values like I said you can use whatever I would like.

02:43.260 --> 02:48.230
We're gonna go first by let's say 50 pixels NO SAY LIKE THIS.

02:48.270 --> 02:54.030
NOW THIS IS GONNA indent this first line but maybe it is annoying the fact that everything is aligned

02:54.030 --> 02:56.720
right anyway so let me comment this out.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.820
I'm going to say it.

02:57.930 --> 02:59.640
Now this is gonna be normal.

02:59.640 --> 03:03.040
And then sure enough we have text and then 250 pixels.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.120
You don't believe me.

03:04.180 --> 03:05.970
Let's make hundred pixels.

03:05.970 --> 03:07.770
And now this is in the thing again.

03:07.770 --> 03:08.560
On first line.

03:08.900 --> 03:11.650
No like I said we can use also Harry M values.

03:11.830 --> 03:13.070
So I don't know.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.030
Our.

03:14.130 --> 03:15.520
That should do the trick.

03:15.510 --> 03:21.600
Now that's 10 arms and that's how we can work with text the line properties and text in the.
