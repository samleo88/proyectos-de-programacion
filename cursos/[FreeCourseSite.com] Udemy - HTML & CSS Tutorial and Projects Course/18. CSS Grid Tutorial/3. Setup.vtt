00:00.300 --> 00:03.020
Before we can take a look at CSX grid syntax.

00:03.020 --> 00:05.760
First and foremost we're going to need our setup.

00:05.880 --> 00:08.060
Now if you don't feel like working on a setup.

00:08.190 --> 00:13.530
Just head over to the resources of this video and you're gonna be able to find the source code.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.530
Now the setup is going to be very very short.

00:16.590 --> 00:20.340
So why don't we start working on it now first and foremost.

00:20.340 --> 00:28.650
I'm going to create a folder and I'm going to name my folder grid tutorial but of course naming is really

00:28.650 --> 00:32.170
up to you to torrio.

00:32.230 --> 00:32.860
All right.

00:32.860 --> 00:34.940
I have my tutorial now.

00:35.410 --> 00:40.240
Now I would like to of course open up my text editor drag and drop it there.

00:41.140 --> 00:49.280
Then within a text that are let's create index CML as well as style CSM styles.

00:49.310 --> 00:50.030
Yes.

00:50.440 --> 00:57.420
Then within the indexation email we can scaffold right away our the email setup or basic change the

00:57.560 --> 01:02.010
email structure by just pressing the exclamation mark.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.260
And there you go.

01:03.310 --> 01:07.120
We have our Asian email setup now within the HDMI.

01:07.120 --> 01:19.030
Why don't we write let's say as a title grid tutorial to draw your and then we also would like to have

01:19.090 --> 01:24.160
our linked tags because we would like to link these styles to assess That's right.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.350
Link styles.

01:26.360 --> 01:29.190
See it says we have linked it correctly.

01:29.380 --> 01:32.730
And then I also like to spin up my local dev server.

01:32.860 --> 01:39.110
Now for that I'm going to use my extension my the name of preview on the web server.

01:39.290 --> 01:43.320
Or you could also of course use the live server if you want it.

01:43.450 --> 01:44.200
All right.

01:44.200 --> 01:51.370
Now like I said preview on a web server that is going to be my choice and for my default browser I already

01:51.370 --> 01:54.160
have the Firefox developer edition.

01:54.370 --> 01:57.510
You can use Chrome you can use a regular Firefox.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.240
It's really up to you.

01:59.260 --> 02:07.070
The reason why I would suggest using Firefox browser is the fact that it has a nicer dev tools.

02:07.210 --> 02:13.660
As far as says grid is concerned but you can follow along also with a Google Chrome.

02:13.660 --> 02:15.080
It's really up to you.

02:15.130 --> 02:21.650
So in order to spin it up I'm going to right click it and then I have an option of launch on the browser.

02:21.660 --> 02:21.950
All right.

02:22.330 --> 02:26.710
Now I also of course have the shortcut but I'm going to use it this time.

02:27.070 --> 02:32.980
Then once I launched my dev server I'm going to set up my smaller browser windows side by side with

02:32.980 --> 02:34.710
my text to her.

02:34.710 --> 02:36.350
That's number one.

02:36.550 --> 02:39.580
And then I'm going to also close this welcome tag.

02:39.640 --> 02:41.000
I don't think I need it.

02:41.080 --> 02:46.030
I can make my side much smaller and essentially close it altogether.

02:46.030 --> 02:47.380
That's that.

02:47.410 --> 02:50.840
Then within the body why don't we create a container.

02:51.010 --> 02:56.640
So why we say there's going to be a div by the class of container and then also two more days.

02:56.800 --> 03:02.650
Now for these particular there is I'm gonna use a little bit of I'm at magic where I'm gonna set up

03:02.650 --> 03:09.370
post the class but then as a text within this particular div I'm gonna write cell and then let's just

03:09.370 --> 03:10.410
get a number of.

03:10.410 --> 03:14.210
So in this case we're going to create only two of them.

03:14.650 --> 03:20.770
So no biggie later on this particular code can help us to let's say create 15 selves.

03:21.570 --> 03:22.510
Okay.

03:22.540 --> 03:25.340
Now I do have my indexation AML.

03:25.480 --> 03:31.810
And lastly I'm just gonna add a style tax now within the staff tax as we're progressing through the

03:31.810 --> 03:32.740
tutorial.

03:32.860 --> 03:39.370
I'm going to write my C here because I find it more useful where our general setup is within ELC assessed

03:39.820 --> 03:45.160
but then whatever styles as far as greatest concern we're going to add it in the indexation shameful

03:45.520 --> 03:48.780
is that where you can write away c how many children we have.

03:48.790 --> 03:50.860
What is our overall setup.

03:50.860 --> 03:52.890
And along those lines.

03:52.900 --> 03:53.590
All right.

03:53.590 --> 04:00.460
Now of course as you would normally within your project well you're gonna use the style C as this or

04:00.460 --> 04:06.490
any kind of stat sheet but for this particular scenario I'm going to use in fact the style tax within

04:06.490 --> 04:07.330
the indexation.

04:07.870 --> 04:14.760
Now once we have that setup then let's head over to style C assess and let's do a reset.

04:15.070 --> 04:15.390
Okay.

04:16.080 --> 04:25.690
Where we have a margin of zero then padding of zero as well as box sizing is going to be a boring box.

04:25.720 --> 04:33.630
Now the reason why I'm going with a broader box is because when we have box sizing with a value of more

04:33.630 --> 04:40.080
box if we have some kind of width for the element and in formatting let's say for example padding my

04:40.170 --> 04:42.670
element is not gonna get bigger.

04:42.670 --> 04:43.020
Okay.

04:43.440 --> 04:50.940
Now what else I have within the ELC Asus I would want probably to select the body and then add some

04:50.940 --> 05:01.250
fun family and not fun display on family and I'm going to go with Madonna then let's have maybe a colour

05:01.940 --> 05:05.300
and colour is going to be hashtag to the tune.

05:05.420 --> 05:07.400
Well that's my set up for the body.

05:07.400 --> 05:13.370
And then why don't we target in fact the container first and foremost let's target the container and

05:13.370 --> 05:16.670
what I would like to do is add a border all around.

05:16.670 --> 05:25.660
So I'm gonna say five pixels solid now colour is up to you I'm gonna go with black and there you go.

05:25.790 --> 05:33.470
We have our border as well as last thing that I would like to do within our general staff says is to

05:33.470 --> 05:35.760
have some kind of styling for the cell.

05:35.960 --> 05:39.900
So each and every grid item well eventually grid item.

05:39.980 --> 05:43.110
Currently it's just a div with a glass of cell.

05:43.730 --> 05:52.930
So let's say sell some targeting each and every cell and I'm gonna add some padding to our Ms.

05:52.940 --> 05:56.590
Why don't we add some background and for the background.

05:56.630 --> 05:58.190
I'm gonna go with the EDA.

05:58.190 --> 06:09.680
The hash tag of course for my hex colour text transform I could go with uppercase for case what else

06:10.520 --> 06:21.070
font weight is going to be bold and then I have text align center and then lastly I'm also going to

06:21.060 --> 06:28.380
add a border around each and every cell just so we can clearly see where one cell ends and the other

06:28.380 --> 06:29.420
one starts.

06:29.660 --> 06:38.420
So let's go with border one pixel solid again colouring is up to you I'm going to go with the red and

06:38.430 --> 06:42.960
there you go there are my container with my cells.

06:42.960 --> 06:47.910
Now lastly I would also want to point it out that throughout tutorial I'm going to zoom in and zoom

06:47.910 --> 06:50.130
out depending on situation.

06:50.280 --> 06:53.970
Just so you can see clear of overall setup.

06:53.990 --> 06:54.330
All right.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.190
Now this is it.

06:56.190 --> 07:03.300
We have our setup we have our email we have our sources and we are ready to deep dive into wonderful

07:03.300 --> 07:05.220
world of seeing says grid.
