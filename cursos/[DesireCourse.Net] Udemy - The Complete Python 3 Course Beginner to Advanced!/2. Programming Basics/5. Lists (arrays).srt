1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:08,820
Alright, so let's discuss lists and what
they are in Python. So, let's open up

2

00:00:08,820  -->  00:00:17,430
terminal again and launch a Python 3
console. So, if you do have experience

3

00:00:17,430  -->  00:00:22,590
with programming in other languages,
let's say PHP, you know how to create an

4

00:00:22,590  -->  00:00:29,490
array and what an array is. For anybody
else it's a way to to keep data organized

5

00:00:29,490  -->  00:00:33,480
and within one construct. So we're going
to go ahead and define an array and how

6

00:00:33,480  -->  00:00:39,480
we do that Python is just open up and
close square brackets, and then in them

7

00:00:39,480  -->  00:00:46,710
we're going to have some items and those items are going to each have their own

8

00:00:46,710  -->  00:00:54,030
index number within the array. So, let's
say we're making a list of things that I

9

00:00:54,030  -->  00:01:05,700
like. I'm going to type "["Movies", "Games", "Python"]" Now what this

10

00:01:05,700  -->  00:01:11,280
becomes is a list that has three indexes
and we saw earlier when we split a

11

00:01:11,280  -->  00:01:15,630
string apart that created one of these
and so you guys already know how to

12

00:01:15,630  -->  00:01:22,020
access items within this array, however if
you forgot we're going to go ahead and

13

00:01:22,020  -->  00:01:28,439
do that. So, basically I can put an index
of 0 "[0]" and it's going to print out movies.

14

00:01:28,439  -->  00:01:32,579
Now if we put that in a print statement,

15

00:01:36,990  -->  00:01:43,950
we're going to concatenate it, "print("I Like" +"

16

00:01:43,950  -->  00:01:54,119
Alright, we're gonna get there so...let's
go ahead and print this out it says "I like

17

00:01:54,119  -->  00:01:58,110
movies" if we change that index number [1] it'ss going to say "I like games" and if I

18

00:01:58,110  -->  00:01:59,490
change that to [2],

19

00:01:59,490  -->  00:02:06,210
oh not 3, so "I like Python" as well.
Now what happens if one of these are a

20

00:02:06,210  -->  00:02:11,720
number? Let's say I replace this with the number 16,

21

00:02:11,720  -->  00:02:19,910
let's say "I like 16" go ahead and change
this index to "[1]" then hit enter. It can't

22

00:02:19,910  -->  00:02:25,790
convert the integer to string. So what we
would do is if we were trying to print,

23

00:02:25,790  -->  00:02:30,410
and this specifically printing out an
array and then choosing an index that

24

00:02:30,410  -->  00:02:34,610
time of recreation or list, that's
impractical and we're never going to do

25

00:02:34,610  -->  00:02:40,340
things that way. So, what we just saw
this error message doesn't really matter.

26

00:02:40,910  -->  00:02:44,630
Basically again if you're trying to
concatenate strings with an integer it's

27

00:02:44,630  -->  00:02:49,880
gonna freak out because it doesn't know
how to do that. So that is what a list is,

28

00:02:49,880  -->  00:02:54,470
it's just a way to to create a collection
under one variable name and when we

29

00:02:54,470  -->  00:02:59,840
discuss variables we will revisit this
so you guys can see what i mean. In the

30

00:02:59,840  -->  00:03:05,630
next video we're going to be talking
about dictionaries, and basically these

31

00:03:05,630  -->  00:03:13,580
are like in JavaScript you can create
JSON objects and that's basically what

32

00:03:13,580  -->  00:03:16,700
they are. So, let's get into that.
