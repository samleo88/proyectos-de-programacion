WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:01.100
Awesome.

00:01.170 --> 00:08.100
Once we have covered our first property by the name of flux direction and I purposely left it here the

00:08.100 --> 00:10.370
flux direction by the value overall.

00:10.440 --> 00:14.380
Just so you can always refresh your memory that is said by default.

00:14.550 --> 00:22.470
Next up we have flex wrap property and the best way for me to show you the flex for our property is

00:22.470 --> 00:24.610
by in fact creating more items.

00:24.670 --> 00:25.220
Okay.

00:25.430 --> 00:29.560
Now first and foremost what I'm gonna do is just copy and paste it.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.680
Let's add another class.

00:31.710 --> 00:34.290
This class is going to be generic.

00:34.320 --> 00:37.490
Let's also add the Capital Case G.

00:37.950 --> 00:40.120
I was going to stand for generic.

00:40.290 --> 00:45.910
Then we're gonna copy and paste it let's say four more times and let's save it.

00:45.930 --> 00:52.620
And then within the styles C Asus Let's in fact target class generic and then let's add some kind of

00:52.620 --> 00:53.260
background.

00:53.310 --> 01:01.090
Now it can be any color you like in order to save us some time instead of typing out the new hex color.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.870
I'm just gonna copy and paste the blue one.

01:04.380 --> 01:11.850
Now the moment we do that we right away can notice something really really interesting where if our

01:11.850 --> 01:20.280
Flex container is able to fit boxes everything is like we already had before where we just have a line

01:20.280 --> 01:21.910
of all our boxes.

01:21.950 --> 01:31.740
However the moment the Flex parent container or flex container is not able to fit all our items what

01:31.740 --> 01:37.150
happens is that they are laid out in one line and in fact set to overflow.

01:37.500 --> 01:45.210
So essentially what this means is that if Lex container is not able to fit all our items what happens

01:45.240 --> 01:48.080
is that our user needs to start scrolling.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.800
So if we have enough space.

01:50.900 --> 01:57.270
I said typical behavior like we already had before but if we have a smaller space.

01:57.270 --> 02:03.060
So if our screen size in fact gets smaller our user needs to start scrolling.

02:03.060 --> 02:09.450
If the items take up more space then in fact our Flex container allows.

02:09.460 --> 02:09.990
OK.

02:10.160 --> 02:17.280
Now the reason why that is happening because again we have a default and that default is no Nora.

02:17.530 --> 02:24.960
So if I'm gonna write here let's wrap that is of course the name of the property and if I'm gonna go

02:24.960 --> 02:32.310
with no wrap you're gonna notice that nothing in our layout changes again as that is the default behavior

02:32.610 --> 02:34.230
that is set by flex parks.

02:34.260 --> 02:37.300
However we also have more values.

02:37.470 --> 02:41.390
We have a value of rap as well as we have a rap reverse.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.510
So let's start with a rap.

02:43.920 --> 02:49.800
So what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna copy and paste it and since of course I'm applying this

02:49.920 --> 02:57.510
after Dino rap you're gonna notice that our layout is going to change right away because what is going

02:57.510 --> 03:04.800
to happen is that when there's not enough space for our items in one line instead of just keeping in

03:04.800 --> 03:07.840
one line and setting them as overflow.

03:07.950 --> 03:09.920
In fact we're going to start a new line.

03:10.230 --> 03:17.340
So if there's enough space awesome they're setting one line but the moment we don't have enough space

03:17.700 --> 03:23.250
well we're starting a new line so there's gonna be two lines in a flux container.

03:23.250 --> 03:28.480
So if we need even more space then we're gonna just create more and more lines.

03:28.620 --> 03:32.480
As you can see right now we're not able to separate this item here.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.430
So that's the reason why we're starting a new one now.

03:35.430 --> 03:45.610
Lastly we also have an option of rap reverse so what we can do is we can just write the rap I felt reverse.

03:45.750 --> 03:48.480
Now in this case if there's not enough space.

03:48.630 --> 03:52.060
First and foremost we're going to start a new line.

03:52.140 --> 03:57.090
But not only that we're also going to flip the order of the atoms.

03:57.150 --> 03:59.190
So as you can see there's not enough space.

03:59.220 --> 04:05.260
So we have one two three and all that starting from the second row.

04:05.610 --> 04:09.390
And then this last item is in fact sitting here in the first row.

04:09.450 --> 04:15.410
So the smaller the screen size gets well the more items we're adding in the rows 2 and 3.

04:15.690 --> 04:20.190
So that's the whole setup now to kind of give you an idea of where you would use that.

04:20.490 --> 04:25.560
Well again let's imagine this with me first of all a comment I'll wrap reverse.

04:25.620 --> 04:28.360
Let's imagine that we have some kind of Nambour.

04:28.770 --> 04:35.820
So probably when we get to a smaller screen size we would still want our user to in fact see all the

04:35.820 --> 04:36.340
legs.

04:36.390 --> 04:37.080
Correct.

04:37.080 --> 04:43.140
Because if we're gonna go with no wrap while the user on a smaller screen size is going to have to start

04:43.200 --> 04:49.050
in fact scrolling horizontally which is not the best user experience because imagine you have some kind

04:49.050 --> 04:54.990
of lengths and you'd probably want your user all the time to see all your available links.

04:54.990 --> 05:01.170
Otherwise it might be some kind of link where your user cannot navigate because let's imagine that user

05:01.170 --> 05:06.680
doesn't understand that he or she has to in fact do the horizontal scrolling.

05:06.990 --> 05:14.280
So that's the reason why by default we have no wrap but in most cases you're probably going to go with

05:14.340 --> 05:20.940
a wrap for a very simple reason because you would want to have a nice user experience where your user

05:20.970 --> 05:25.710
always always sees all the items and doesn't have to scroll horizontally.
