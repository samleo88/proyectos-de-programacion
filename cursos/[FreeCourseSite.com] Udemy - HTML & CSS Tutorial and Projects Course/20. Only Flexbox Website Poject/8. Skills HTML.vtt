WEBVTT

00:00.140 --> 00:04.160
And the next section are going to be working on is going to be Skills section.

00:04.440 --> 00:07.350
So again we're going to go back to our age now.

00:07.530 --> 00:09.920
We're going to create or hear a lot of room.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.380
So it is easier for us to work.

00:12.520 --> 00:19.650
And over here we're going to place a comment on here we're going to say skills section here and we're

00:19.650 --> 00:25.230
going to select the whole line and copy and paste this and all we're going to write and this is going

00:25.230 --> 00:28.120
to be and of skills.

00:28.590 --> 00:31.460
And after that within the skills section first.

00:31.490 --> 00:31.810
Right.

00:31.820 --> 00:38.610
This is going to be section right here with an ID and we're going to say skills and we're going to press

00:38.610 --> 00:45.120
tab and all here are going to say that we would want first a title and this title actually going to

00:45.120 --> 00:47.950
be repeating for all of our sections.

00:47.970 --> 00:52.280
Right now there's going to be a different name or here but the styling is going to be the same.

00:52.500 --> 00:58.200
So here we're going to say title you know this and then we're going to say that this is going to be

00:58.290 --> 01:05.750
a war here and the title so we can go back over here select the whole line right here.

01:05.820 --> 01:11.770
Copy this one and we're going to say we're here and have a title over here.

01:11.820 --> 01:19.470
The first thing that we want to do is actually have a div with a class of title here title then or here

01:19.620 --> 01:29.440
within a day of we're going to have a handing one with a class of text we're here and we're here within

01:29.550 --> 01:31.120
the title text we're going to write it.

01:31.160 --> 01:37.810
Is going to be skills when you're doing this and you can see that this didn't work out the way you wanted.

01:37.820 --> 01:40.050
Right so this is going to be skills.

01:40.050 --> 01:45.860
And then once we press on here now we have a heading one with a skills.

01:45.930 --> 01:50.190
Then after that we're going to have a day of title underly.

01:50.610 --> 01:56.600
I'm going to say title on the line first time now we have title underlined.

01:56.970 --> 01:59.340
Then now this is going to be the end of title.

01:59.430 --> 02:02.430
Now I would want a actual skills section.

02:02.790 --> 02:10.710
So the first thing we're going to have is they give me the skills center class here and within this

02:10.830 --> 02:18.360
diverse skill center class we're going to have a article where we're here and we're going to say class

02:19.170 --> 02:21.990
we're here and this is going to be skill.

02:22.080 --> 02:25.240
Right so each individual skill we're here.

02:25.470 --> 02:34.180
And then after that within this article first would want to have is a high if he were here and this

02:34.200 --> 02:36.370
what I'm going to call it a pie chart.

02:36.670 --> 02:41.150
So going to be a pie chart here.

02:41.190 --> 02:43.300
Press time now we have our.

02:43.420 --> 02:49.080
Then after that we would want to have a heading three panel here we're going to write and you can see

02:49.080 --> 02:49.580
or hear.

02:49.620 --> 02:51.480
This is our part pie chart right.

02:51.510 --> 02:53.650
The small guy over here over here.

02:53.660 --> 02:55.110
This is going to be hitting three.

02:55.270 --> 03:02.270
And this is going to be here best here or here we're going to have a third thing this is going to be

03:02.280 --> 03:03.040
paragraph.

03:03.300 --> 03:06.560
So I'm going to say a paragraph within the paragraph I'm going to write Laura.

03:06.610 --> 03:12.110
All right this is going to be dummy text and now we're using this brackets extension basically and oh

03:12.150 --> 03:18.990
here I'm going to say I would say 15 here and like this and you know what I think we went a little bit

03:19.530 --> 03:22.020
too much here.

03:22.020 --> 03:23.400
Let's see where we should then.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.190
Right.

03:24.210 --> 03:25.170
So you know what.

03:25.290 --> 03:28.520
Yeah let's just fine but just leave it like it is.

03:28.650 --> 03:30.450
This one is going to be fine enough.

03:30.500 --> 03:37.050
And here again you can decide if this text is you need more text or less text or however you would want.

03:37.050 --> 03:37.610
Right.

03:37.710 --> 03:43.020
Because usually I don't like putting too much text because sometimes it doesn't look very good.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.840
Now let's just check it out right.

03:44.850 --> 03:50.790
So this is going to be an article or here what we can do is we can go back over here and we can again

03:50.790 --> 03:56.800
sort of like line by line here like this and then we can just copy and paste this right.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.690
So we would need five more.

03:58.690 --> 04:03.520
So one two three four five and so five of them.

04:03.720 --> 04:10.120
And now for The Age CML the only thing left to do is we're just going to change these.

04:10.170 --> 04:10.760
Right.

04:10.830 --> 04:13.720
So this is going to be pie chart here.

04:13.890 --> 04:19.110
The next one we're going to say this is going to be a line chart so I'm going to say over here the line

04:19.630 --> 04:22.770
and shoulder here you can see this change over here.

04:22.770 --> 04:31.440
This is we're going to change the value instead of a best data and say best results results here.

04:31.770 --> 04:36.880
And then after We're going to have a four bolt here.

04:37.240 --> 04:43.960
So we're going to say bolt instead of data here we're going to and this is going to be fast the speed

04:44.590 --> 04:52.250
fastest speed reading this then we're going to have a flask.

04:52.260 --> 05:02.960
So this is going to be not if they want to say flask here and this is going to be innovation this innovation.

05:03.110 --> 05:03.400
Right.

05:03.460 --> 05:07.670
And once we write innovation I actually realize that I copied two more.

05:07.690 --> 05:12.280
All right so too many superheroes would want to do is just get rid of these guys.

05:12.500 --> 05:15.280
No here we're going to have only four of them right.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.780
That was the intention.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.480
Now let's go to see assess.

05:18.560 --> 05:21.300
And let's actually start telling the skills section.
