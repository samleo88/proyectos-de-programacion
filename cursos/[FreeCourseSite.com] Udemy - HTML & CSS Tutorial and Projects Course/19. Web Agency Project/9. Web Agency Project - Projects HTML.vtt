WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:04.840
And the next section are going to be creating we're here and this is going to be the projects section.

00:04.850 --> 00:10.230
And so here we're going to look at the Zoom in effect right and how to have this text again to appear

00:10.800 --> 00:12.700
only ones who are hovering right.

00:12.770 --> 00:14.630
So we're going to go back to the next issue.

00:14.640 --> 00:18.540
Now we're going to go somewhere all the way in the bottom right.

00:18.540 --> 00:24.180
And we're going to say this is going to be project S. projects section here.

00:24.300 --> 00:27.480
And then we're going to have a section with the idea of projects.

00:27.570 --> 00:31.480
So here we're going to say Heidi and this is going to be project.

00:31.740 --> 00:35.680
And then once we have this we're actually going to copy and paste the title.

00:35.790 --> 00:38.000
It's all going to go all the way over here.

00:38.140 --> 00:42.360
We'll find where his services title right the title that we created.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.330
So this is the title.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.080
It's going to grab the title.

00:46.150 --> 00:51.100
I was going to have to change it around a little bit more here in HDMI and see.

00:51.180 --> 00:51.880
This.

00:51.890 --> 00:52.730
All right so here.

00:52.770 --> 00:57.410
This is going to be project and the rest of it are going to change that and see.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.020
Yes.

00:58.090 --> 01:02.000
Right so we have project and then we're going to have a project's container.

01:02.010 --> 01:02.280
Right.

01:02.280 --> 01:10.920
So this is section and I'm we're going to say this is going to be Dave the class of projects we're here

01:11.100 --> 01:14.760
and container for this.

01:14.790 --> 01:16.560
And then we're going to have an article inside here.

01:16.560 --> 01:17.090
Right.

01:17.310 --> 01:25.470
So I'm going to say this is going to be article and with the class of projects I am here like this and

01:25.470 --> 01:27.410
then we're going to have an image right.

01:27.450 --> 01:33.200
And we're going to see the image and the image is right away we don't need any classes.

01:33.210 --> 01:39.000
Some going to say images and this is going to be current project one here like this and I'm going to

01:39.000 --> 01:43.040
say alternative image here like this.

01:43.040 --> 01:50.250
And then we're going to have a div with a image text right to was listed within the article we're going

01:50.250 --> 01:55.450
to say or here this is going to be div with image text right.

01:55.590 --> 02:02.520
And then we're going to have a heading one here and heading one is going to be project flex so our hero

02:02.540 --> 02:11.080
can write project or flex and then we're going to have a heading six right underneath.

02:11.400 --> 02:21.210
So we're going to go here and say heading 6 and this is going to be a design or here design and web

02:21.210 --> 02:26.820
development of a lot man or here like this.

02:26.880 --> 02:33.770
And then once actual image text ends or here we're going to have a image for it.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.270
We're going to have it Dave.

02:35.310 --> 02:37.760
It's going to be image for her.

02:38.220 --> 02:41.000
And here the first thing is going to be for her icon.

02:41.250 --> 02:48.210
All right so we're going to say over here Dave and this is going to be FOOTNER I can't class and we're

02:48.210 --> 02:55.090
here with this for I kind of we're going to place a comment so I for comment.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.330
Oh here goes.

02:58.830 --> 03:03.450
And then really just going to a place right next to zero and it's all going to say this is going to

03:03.450 --> 03:04.450
be zero.

03:04.940 --> 03:08.280
Are you doing this and then we're going to have a full day.

03:08.350 --> 03:14.740
All right so still within a foot or right foot right now would want a four hour day.

03:15.060 --> 03:22.460
And so we're all going to have a div and this is going to be a further date like this and he'll get

03:22.470 --> 03:22.770
it right.

03:22.770 --> 03:27.060
This is going to be December and this is going to be 12.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.270
And this is going to be 2017.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.080
All right.

03:31.290 --> 03:37.130
So now we have everything set up now the only thing left to do is for the project item right.

03:37.200 --> 03:42.500
We obviously need to actually copy these right and make three of them right.

03:42.510 --> 03:44.420
So here this is the container.

03:44.670 --> 03:50.660
So this just going to say this is going to be item and this is going to be the end of it.

03:50.780 --> 03:51.030
All right.

03:51.030 --> 03:56.760
So here I'm going to say and of home and then we're just going to copy this.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.780
All right so we're going to have this one too.

03:59.880 --> 04:00.300
Right.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.800
And here it's going to be projects too.

04:04.230 --> 04:06.030
And this is going to be projects three.

04:06.050 --> 04:08.490
Now I'm not going to be changing any kind of text around here.

04:08.490 --> 04:08.820
Right.

04:08.820 --> 04:10.680
That's really up to you if you want to do it.

04:10.680 --> 04:15.870
Go ahead and obviously for your project you probably wanted to look a little bit different right.

04:15.890 --> 04:18.550
But I'm just going to leave with the way it is over here right.

04:18.570 --> 04:22.660
So we're just going to say this one over here and then we're going to go to see assassin's.
