WEBVTT

00:00.510 --> 00:01.050
Excellent.

00:01.050 --> 00:04.410
We have our extra small screen and small screen layout.

00:04.770 --> 00:12.030
However we also need to work on our C assess just so once we get to a bigger screen size well we're

00:12.030 --> 00:14.260
gonna have this particular layout.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.310
Well like I said there's going to be a logo.

00:16.310 --> 00:17.310
No button.

00:17.310 --> 00:22.760
And then links in the center as well as my nav icons.

00:23.130 --> 00:26.250
Now in order not to switch back and forth.

00:26.370 --> 00:31.230
In fact what I'm going to do right now is zoom out here.

00:31.410 --> 00:36.190
So I'm going to go back to the hundred and I'm going to try to do it side by side here.

00:36.240 --> 00:42.000
So that way I think it's gonna be less annoying the fact that I don't have to switch back and forth

00:42.000 --> 00:43.020
all the time.

00:43.500 --> 00:48.560
Now let's test that out first and foremost by setting up the media query because that way I'm gonna

00:48.570 --> 00:51.960
see exactly when I get to nine hundred and ninety two.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.250
Now of course it's really up to you.

00:53.250 --> 00:57.340
You can use a different size but I went with nine hundred ninety two.

00:57.390 --> 01:01.500
So once we get to nine hundred ninety two then I'm going to change my layout.

01:01.920 --> 01:10.580
So let's write screen and I'm going to go with men with of nine hundred ninety two pixels.

01:10.960 --> 01:16.340
And first of all it's to start out by looking at the nav bar and I'm going to add some background color

01:16.340 --> 01:17.000
of red.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.220
Now I'm gonna delete this particular one but I just want to test once I get to nine hundred ninety two.

01:22.260 --> 01:22.680
OK.

01:22.730 --> 01:23.230
There you go.

01:23.230 --> 01:25.120
I think it looks really well.

01:25.190 --> 01:29.750
Hopefully you're gonna be able to see everything that we're doing and what I'm going to do right now

01:29.750 --> 01:31.920
is I'm just going to get rid of this nav bar.

01:31.980 --> 01:37.130
Now first of all what I would like to do is in fact hide my button.

01:37.220 --> 01:42.650
Now remember that was something that I mentioned that once we'd get to the bigger screen size I wouldn't

01:42.650 --> 01:44.360
want that button to show.

01:44.360 --> 01:51.340
So remember Button had enough toggle class and we're gonna go with display of none.

01:51.350 --> 01:52.340
That's number one.

01:52.850 --> 02:01.490
Now second once we get to the bigger screen size nav links remember that was our class we had a nav

02:01.490 --> 02:07.110
links class and my links are displayed currently this way they are displayed as the blocks or they're

02:07.130 --> 02:09.650
stacked one on top of each other.

02:09.680 --> 02:15.470
What I would like to do once I get to nine hundred ninety two I'm going to go with a nav links and I'm

02:15.470 --> 02:20.810
gonna set them up as display of flex like so that second.

02:20.840 --> 02:27.310
Now currently I'm also gonna add something very interesting with a value of height order.

02:27.650 --> 02:33.400
Now it does not make sense right now but later when we're going to set up the functionality I'm going

02:33.400 --> 02:38.420
to come back to this property in value but I just wanted to add it anyway right now right away within

02:38.420 --> 02:42.800
my meter query but currently it doesn't make sense because it doesn't change anything.

02:42.830 --> 02:49.130
But I am adding height of order because later in order to set up our functionality in fact we are going

02:49.130 --> 02:53.930
to control the height of my LAV links but we're gonna get there.

02:53.930 --> 03:01.670
Now also I'd like to show my icons remember icons had a parent container with a class of NAV icons and

03:01.670 --> 03:05.280
for them I'm going to set up display of flex.

03:05.550 --> 03:06.740
And there you go.

03:06.740 --> 03:09.210
Now we have our icons OK.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.240
All that is working really well.

03:11.240 --> 03:17.450
And now it's start working with our NAV center because remember we had the nav bar but then within the

03:17.450 --> 03:19.910
NAB bar we had this nav central class.

03:20.090 --> 03:23.840
So this now center is in fact a parent for nav header.

03:23.840 --> 03:30.770
It is a parent for the NAV links and then we have the NAV icons and you can think of it as three children.

03:30.860 --> 03:32.140
One is the header.

03:32.150 --> 03:33.390
Second one is the links.

03:33.530 --> 03:35.890
And then we have our NAV icons.

03:36.170 --> 03:41.830
So let's start working on it because it is probably going to be one of the most important ones.

03:42.080 --> 03:49.610
As far as styling goes so let's go with Nan center and let's start very simply by setting up some kind

03:49.610 --> 03:56.750
of Max width so I'm going to say that this particular div is going to have Max with of eleven hundred

03:56.750 --> 04:01.430
seventy and then margin of 0 and auto.

04:01.520 --> 04:09.710
And in this case I am going to in fact switch over to the other screen just so you can see that if we

04:09.710 --> 04:13.750
start scrolling and I think it's going to be easier if we just zoom out.

04:13.800 --> 04:20.960
But in general you should be able to see that my nav center here is in fact eleven hundred seventy just

04:20.960 --> 04:23.940
like the remaining of my sections.

04:24.260 --> 04:30.830
So that was the reason why I added here this max width of 11 70 just because I would want to have the

04:30.830 --> 04:37.340
same styling as rest of my sections and I'm just adding here margin of 0 and auto just so it's always

04:37.340 --> 04:39.910
sitting here in the center.

04:40.280 --> 04:47.960
Then we're gonna have some display of flex because I would want my header my links my icons to be displayed

04:47.960 --> 04:50.020
in one line like so.

04:50.030 --> 04:50.780
And there you go.

04:50.780 --> 04:52.820
Now they're sitting in one line.

04:52.910 --> 04:56.210
Now I also like to push them as far as possible from each other.

04:57.080 --> 05:04.730
So let's use space between and yes we do have it now then also let's align all of them in the center

05:05.120 --> 05:10.970
because notice our logo is bigger our links are bigger so we have also our small icons.

05:10.970 --> 05:13.320
So why don't we place them all in a center.

05:13.430 --> 05:17.390
And now we have all of them lined nicely in the center.

05:17.420 --> 05:23.810
And lastly even though my setup doesn't require because I'm just switching to nine hundred ninety two

05:24.170 --> 05:27.470
I'm only changing the screen size once I get to nine or 92.

05:27.500 --> 05:32.650
You might as well also add right away flex wrap an equal to wrap just in case you ever.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.260
I don't need it.

05:34.640 --> 05:37.200
But in this case it is optional.

05:37.220 --> 05:43.370
Now remember don't have header had already some pairings some patterns that we used on a smaller screen

05:43.370 --> 05:44.010
size.

05:44.060 --> 05:49.790
So what I would like to do right now is head over to NAV header and just say Hey listen buddy your batting

05:49.790 --> 05:51.790
should be 0 0.

05:51.800 --> 05:52.280
That's it.

05:52.280 --> 05:56.240
I don't want any pairings that are coming previously.

05:56.600 --> 05:57.560
That's number one.

05:57.560 --> 06:03.480
Now I also want to do the same thing for my links because links also had some pairings.

06:03.500 --> 06:09.860
So I'm going to say here you know what for the batting or the links let's right now have a link and

06:09.860 --> 06:14.940
I'm sorry not links but link and we're going to set it up as 0 like so.

06:15.320 --> 06:23.180
So now I have no padding from the small screen size and we can start finally working on our layout as

06:23.180 --> 06:26.720
far as well as we're working with our items.

06:26.810 --> 06:33.140
Now when I say that in fact I am misleading I'm a little bit because we still need to fix this notice

06:33.140 --> 06:37.390
from our previous screen size from small screen size we still have this effect.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.650
So why don't we do this.

06:38.660 --> 06:44.290
Why don't we say now the link cover and let's change it around let's say when we're hovering batting

06:44.360 --> 06:45.560
shouldn't change.

06:45.590 --> 06:50.020
So padding is going to stay zero and background is going to be transparent.

06:50.040 --> 06:50.200
Right.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.460
Because remember we were changing the background.

06:52.580 --> 06:57.640
So now the only thing that is happening is in fact we are.

06:57.940 --> 06:58.610
Oh yeah.

06:58.650 --> 07:01.490
Natalie cover story now handling cover.

07:01.520 --> 07:06.280
Now it is working only thing that is happening we are changing the color.

07:06.290 --> 07:06.530
All right.

07:06.530 --> 07:11.380
Nothing else is changing as far as our links are concerned.

07:11.390 --> 07:15.480
So let me zoom in and you're going to notice that we're only changing the color.

07:15.560 --> 07:22.250
So now we're done in fact removing all the things that we had already previously on our small screen

07:22.250 --> 07:22.800
size.

07:22.820 --> 07:25.520
So now we can finally start working just with this layout.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.020
So let's start with a napper.

07:28.550 --> 07:36.170
And for Navarre I'm going to go with padding of one arms and two areas mark so I'm going to add some

07:36.170 --> 07:37.160
padding here.

07:37.250 --> 07:40.150
Then let's in fact work with now center.

07:40.170 --> 07:45.890
Now technically I could again add these properties here with the values but the reason why I'm setting

07:45.950 --> 07:50.990
this up separately because I think it's a little bit clearer of what we're doing step by step.

07:51.170 --> 07:58.100
Because in my opinion if I'm going to add these properties here somewhere on the top while they might

07:58.100 --> 07:59.100
not make sense.

07:59.110 --> 07:59.660
OK.

07:59.810 --> 08:05.480
And this particular property is just going to be nav bar and I'm going to I'm sorry.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.590
Not now no center.

08:07.870 --> 08:15.140
Navarre center and I would like this particular day to span all across some somewhere say 100 percent

08:15.360 --> 08:15.810
mark so.

08:16.160 --> 08:20.570
So I'm going to set this up as hundred percent not technically we could have placed it this property

08:20.570 --> 08:21.900
now that I'm looking at it.

08:22.010 --> 08:26.400
I mean probably would have made sense but anyway that just was my opinion.

08:26.420 --> 08:30.250
So I set this up does not bar center with with 100 percent.

08:30.370 --> 08:35.380
But then remember that Max with is always going to be eleven hundred and seventy.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.210
All right.

08:36.300 --> 08:44.120
Now I also like to add a little bit of margin for my links so let's write nav bar link or no sorry nav

08:44.140 --> 08:44.850
link.

08:45.080 --> 08:51.500
That was the class and that was the class for each and every link and number each and every link had

08:51.500 --> 08:52.040
this class.

08:52.040 --> 08:59.530
So that's the reason why I'm targeting and then I'm going to say margin right margin right is going

08:59.530 --> 09:02.050
to be zero point seven harems.

09:02.080 --> 09:07.420
Again one of those properties that I could have added here but I just wanted to show you how we get

09:07.420 --> 09:12.820
rid of all the things from the extra small screen size and then we start working with our bigger screen

09:12.820 --> 09:18.410
size and land as far as nav bar and a bigger screen size.

09:18.430 --> 09:22.310
The only thing we really have left is working with these icons.

09:22.570 --> 09:24.400
So why don't we target.

09:24.400 --> 09:31.390
So let's say nav icon was our class and here I'm going to add the same marginal right that I had for

09:31.390 --> 09:36.420
the link zero point seven harems.

09:36.430 --> 09:38.980
That's number one color.

09:39.190 --> 09:44.930
Why don't we go with primary color primary color then font size.

09:44.940 --> 09:52.620
I don't know one point two Harry M's and then transition because as I'm transitioning as I'm hovering

09:52.620 --> 09:59.120
over these icons I would want to change their color and as well as lift them up a little bit.

09:59.130 --> 10:09.210
So why don't we say transition transition and that is going to be our main transition main transition.

10:09.250 --> 10:13.490
And then lastly remember nav icon hover.

10:13.690 --> 10:15.910
And then why don't we do color.

10:16.330 --> 10:24.910
Dark gray dark gray and we can also transform into orbit let's say translate why and I'm going to go

10:24.910 --> 10:27.310
with 10 percent.

10:27.310 --> 10:28.180
Like so.

10:28.240 --> 10:33.710
So now as we're hovering over the icons fact they're gonna move up a little bit.

10:33.790 --> 10:34.510
Yep.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.480
There you go.

10:35.490 --> 10:41.950
Now we have our layout for the extra small screen size our small screen size as well as once we get

10:41.950 --> 10:46.530
to the bigger screen size we get rid of the bunch of the things that we already set up.

10:46.570 --> 10:52.990
So essentially we kind of go back to the scratch and then we use again flex to display all of them in

10:52.990 --> 10:57.170
line and then let's just make sure that we have space in between.

10:57.250 --> 11:03.430
And then lastly we just work a little bit on the icons as well as of course hiding our NAV toggle and

11:03.430 --> 11:04.040
that's it.

11:04.060 --> 11:08.070
We're done with our Navarre as well as our whole project.

11:08.080 --> 11:13.300
Now lastly what's left is in fact just setting up javascript for the functionality.

11:13.300 --> 11:20.680
I did notice the error in the video though where when I was adding a waste of hundred in fact added

11:20.680 --> 11:26.190
to a class of nav bar which in fact does not exist in our index HCM CML.

11:26.230 --> 11:32.920
In fact the class name is NAP center and we in fact targeted that class up here on the top.

11:33.340 --> 11:37.920
So what we would need to do is either change this to a nav center.

11:37.960 --> 11:45.550
So let me change this to now center or you can just simply get rid of it altogether and just add a with.

11:45.550 --> 11:47.900
Also here for the NAF center.

11:47.900 --> 11:53.020
So again there was an error I added with width one hundred two and NAV bar center that in fact does

11:53.020 --> 11:53.950
not exist.

11:53.950 --> 11:54.770
That class.

11:54.940 --> 12:01.690
And then we should add the property with a value of hundred to our NAV center class whether that is

12:01.690 --> 12:08.950
by scrolling up and just adding to our first selection or just changing the net bar center to a nav

12:08.950 --> 12:09.450
center.

12:09.450 --> 12:10.570
Class selector.
