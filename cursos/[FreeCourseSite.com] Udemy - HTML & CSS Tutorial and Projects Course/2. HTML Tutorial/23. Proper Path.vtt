While we're still on the topic of images I would like to talk about path in general.

00:06.790 --> 00:13.120
The email now and this example going to look at the images and how the path is important for images

00:13.770 --> 00:14.080
of war.

00:14.080 --> 00:20.170
Please remember later on we're gonna be working with new pages meaning there's gonna be multiple pages

00:20.170 --> 00:22.650
that we're going to be working with not just indexation.

00:22.660 --> 00:26.050
Email will also going to have about as well as contact.

00:26.290 --> 00:33.380
So the same will going to work with whenever we're working with email far more successful.

00:33.430 --> 00:34.680
Now what I'm talking about.

00:34.970 --> 00:37.040
So let's say for now again we have two images.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.400
World is great.

00:38.450 --> 00:40.210
We are good to go.

00:40.220 --> 00:45.550
Our imagined site where you have 50 images and you have I don't know twenty five.

00:45.550 --> 00:48.750
See as those files and then you have multiple jobs compiled.

00:48.830 --> 00:54.110
Now what's gonna happen is you're going to have to start having some kind of structure having all the

00:54.110 --> 00:59.800
files here in the folder is not going to make sense because there's gonna be really messy.

00:59.810 --> 01:03.610
So the logical thing is gonna be setting up let's say images on the site.

01:04.130 --> 01:09.230
So there's gonna be special folder with images and reality you're going to have images folder.

01:09.350 --> 01:14.540
And then within the images folder you have another folder for let's say home page images and then about

01:14.540 --> 01:16.040
images and you get the point.

01:16.730 --> 01:22.370
Now in our case we're just going to start very simply we're going to create a new folder and let's say

01:22.370 --> 01:26.390
image folder name is gonna be very simply image.

01:26.430 --> 01:31.410
Now what I would like to do right now is remove these images because obviously that was the whole point.

01:31.420 --> 01:37.210
Now I can move them one by one or I can just press on the second one as was the first one.

01:37.370 --> 01:41.330
And in order to select them both you would need to hold the command key.

01:42.020 --> 01:47.330
Now once we hold it notice I can just drag and drop them and now I'm dropping them off in the image

01:47.330 --> 01:52.820
as fast as you can see Visual Studio coders saying Hey listen buddy are you sure this is what you would

01:52.820 --> 01:53.780
like to do.

01:53.930 --> 01:58.360
And I'm just gonna bravely say yep this is exactly what I would like to do.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.770
And notice what happens.

02:01.610 --> 02:03.460
I have the heading three.

02:03.650 --> 02:05.090
So that's good.

02:05.090 --> 02:09.290
I have the other having three and I don't have my images.

02:09.290 --> 02:15.110
Now again the reason why I don't have the images because this path is correct only if the images are

02:15.110 --> 02:19.780
sitting in the same folder are they sitting in the same folder.

02:19.790 --> 02:23.640
Well now right now the images are in fact in the images folder.

02:23.690 --> 02:29.300
So what we would need to do is again we can obviously added here the extra path more I'm just going

02:29.300 --> 02:32.300
to delete this because this is just going to make a little bit more sense.

02:32.300 --> 02:38.360
And can we do the same thing now we do the forwards now forward slash is going to go to where it's gonna

02:38.360 --> 02:42.350
go to images folder and now we're looking for the specific image we would want.

02:42.830 --> 02:43.910
So now case you Demi.

02:44.660 --> 02:50.750
So again this is very important because you will gonna use this for your C assess where your javascript

02:51.590 --> 02:55.870
images make sure that the path actually makes sense.

02:56.220 --> 03:01.790
If it is in a separate folder you need to look in that folder and then you're gonna get an image.

03:01.790 --> 03:06.120
Now let me fix this the same way and again like I said we can just had it here.

03:06.260 --> 03:11.720
So let's say I added and images and sure enough once we do that again this is going to overwrite it

03:12.320 --> 03:20.420
again let's look for the laptop and sure enough this is gonna be proper rendering option since now we

03:20.420 --> 03:21.740
have a proper path.

03:21.920 --> 03:26.140
So always always please remember to make sure that your path is correct.
