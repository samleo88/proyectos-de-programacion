WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:05.490
And the next section we're all going to be building and it's going to be current project section.

00:05.640 --> 00:12.260
Now on the first glance it actually looks very simple when we already have done this multiple times.

00:12.280 --> 00:18.330
Now the difference over here is why I made this technically so simple because I wanted to show you how

00:18.330 --> 00:22.690
we can get a magnifica pop up which is going to be a gallery.

00:22.740 --> 00:27.990
Right so I can see that as I click on the image there's a gallery over here right and over here this

00:28.050 --> 00:30.150
is the Zoom in effect right.

00:30.210 --> 00:38.250
So I made the section easy right because I didn't want to overly confuse you right by actually building

00:38.250 --> 00:44.010
some kind of section with some kind of layouts with some kind of I don't know like transition effect.

00:44.010 --> 00:49.920
Right and then lose the actual the main point of actually how to insert Gowri Once you're going to know

00:49.920 --> 00:51.830
how to work with the gallery.

00:51.870 --> 00:55.280
You can make a section as complicated as you would want.

00:55.530 --> 00:58.770
So here again this is going to be on google.

00:58.770 --> 01:01.490
We're going to be using actually later right.

01:01.600 --> 01:11.100
We would want to go is actually to next HD now on here and maybe let's just make it a little bit more

01:11.120 --> 01:15.920
condensed so actually see what we're doing here right.

01:16.170 --> 01:20.280
This is going to be the end or year of section right.

01:20.550 --> 01:26.610
You can see that we can go back over here and of about you know here we're going to say the current

01:26.610 --> 01:33.230
section and then call it current project or current projects section here.

01:33.630 --> 01:37.320
Let's select a line up in page to line.

01:37.320 --> 01:37.850
We're going to see.

01:37.860 --> 01:42.420
And of course in Project section then I'll do that.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.940
As always we would want a section.

01:45.210 --> 01:53.630
So I'm going to say section right here press on here hash tag and say current price tab all.

01:53.730 --> 01:55.870
Here again we would want a title.

01:56.310 --> 01:59.830
So we're going to go back over here and the closest title is going to be on here.

02:00.300 --> 02:06.780
So we're going to select this on here when we're going to say is that this is going to be a copy paste

02:07.370 --> 02:11.410
and over here would you want the image here.

02:11.520 --> 02:14.340
So the phantasm is going to be image.

02:14.530 --> 02:23.280
Then after that we're going write current projects so we're going to say our current projects here and

02:23.280 --> 02:27.900
then after that we would want to start working with a actual count.

02:28.230 --> 02:34.940
So at the end of title we're going to have a div with a hash tag and we're going to say corrent and

02:35.460 --> 02:38.650
we're going to say Center this.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.760
Then after that we're going to have a bunch of articles.

02:41.820 --> 02:46.890
So here I'm going to say this is going to be article and I'm going to give it a class and I'm going

02:46.890 --> 02:49.820
to say this is going to be current item.

02:49.890 --> 02:54.840
So this is going to be current and I'm class press time.

02:54.890 --> 03:01.080
Now we have article and within the article we're actually going to place a link and we're going to place

03:01.080 --> 03:02.530
the image within the link.

03:02.910 --> 03:05.820
And again we're going to see why we're doing that.

03:05.830 --> 03:09.790
That one's really going to start working with a magnetic pop up.

03:09.900 --> 03:10.180
Right.

03:10.230 --> 03:18.090
But what we would want is a link here then for DHEA if we're going to actually use the image that we're

03:18.090 --> 03:19.820
going to be placing or hear or read.

03:19.890 --> 03:21.330
So I'm going to say here measures.

03:21.570 --> 03:29.100
And since I'm going to be having a current project current project one more here this is going to be

03:29.100 --> 03:29.940
my image.

03:30.150 --> 03:34.040
And now within this link We're going to have image and order.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.260
This is going to match.

03:35.370 --> 03:38.530
So I'm going to say images and current projects.

03:38.530 --> 03:38.820
All right.

03:38.820 --> 03:47.280
So again these two are here and then I'm going to say current project here now that I have this right

03:47.640 --> 03:50.640
what I would want is some more articles like this.

03:50.640 --> 03:57.680
All right so one two three four five six right here.

03:57.810 --> 04:00.830
Just remember to actually change these values.

04:00.840 --> 04:01.160
All right.

04:01.170 --> 04:06.130
So for the link project one that this obviously needs to match.

04:06.180 --> 04:10.220
So here I'm going to say this is going to be let's say or here these two.

04:10.240 --> 04:10.530
Right.

04:10.560 --> 04:15.600
This is going to be actually number two then we're here for this is going to say this is going to be

04:15.600 --> 04:22.010
number three then over here this is going to be actually number four here.

04:22.060 --> 04:28.530
This is going to be number four then we're going to go back because I didn't want to upload 80 images

04:29.000 --> 04:30.870
wisdom to say three over here.

04:31.170 --> 04:35.230
And again we're going to place a two on them all here.

04:35.280 --> 04:42.950
So this is going to be for and this is going to be two and the last one we're going to leave it as one.

04:42.940 --> 04:48.930
All right so we went all the way one to four and then we went back just changed around a little bit

04:48.930 --> 04:54.630
over here and that's pretty much a set up for the HMO.

04:54.870 --> 04:55.270
All right.

04:55.290 --> 05:03.300
So what we can do here can go actually we can save this here and we can actually start working with

05:03.300 --> 05:03.800
them.

05:03.800 --> 05:04.320
All right.

05:04.530 --> 05:08.870
So what I'm going to say here is that this is going to be the main success.

05:09.260 --> 05:16.140
We're going to go all the way and the bottom line to create a comment when I say Place a bunch of hashtags

05:16.140 --> 05:22.770
again and I say corrent again a bunch of hashtags I know we're here we're going to say is we're going

05:22.770 --> 05:25.020
to start with a current title.

05:25.030 --> 05:29.370
So corrent and we're going to say class title.

05:29.380 --> 05:35.370
All right so first we would want to start dealing with this title and what we're going to say with the

05:35.370 --> 05:42.940
title is we want a little bit more margin some sÃ©verine margin for the pixels.

05:43.190 --> 05:46.120
And I would say zero on this.

05:46.380 --> 05:50.960
Then after that we would want to start working with the actual item.

05:50.980 --> 05:51.500
Right.

05:51.540 --> 05:54.440
But let's before we do that let's actually work with an image.

05:54.630 --> 06:00.790
So I'm going to say corrent him and I'm going to say image I don't want here I'm going to say like there's

06:00.790 --> 06:10.250
this play block like this and I'm going to say with and with is going to be 100 percent like this then

06:10.430 --> 06:15.770
opacity was going to set it as one as one over here.

06:15.800 --> 06:27.070
However we're going at a transition transition here we're going to say is Bachardy two seconds is on

06:27.070 --> 06:28.110
here.

06:28.450 --> 06:32.420
Now that we have this it's actually had a hover effect.

06:32.410 --> 06:39.170
So corrent I had him image over here.

06:39.210 --> 06:41.250
So as we hovering what should happen.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.000
So we're going to say that Abbasid is going to be 0.5.

06:45.180 --> 06:49.030
So sorry 0.5 I guess.

06:49.030 --> 06:49.680
All right.

06:49.680 --> 06:55.120
So again as we're going to be hovering is going to be very simple the Apache is going to be changing.

06:55.240 --> 06:59.880
Right so you can see that as I'm hovering what's happening now what I would want to do is actually for

06:59.880 --> 07:03.150
the current item remember the parent thread.

07:03.270 --> 07:08.030
So we had a current item then we had the link then we had an image.

07:08.060 --> 07:13.530
And so for now the past is changing for the image we're going to go back over here and said This is

07:13.530 --> 07:15.320
a background of linear grading.

07:15.540 --> 07:25.830
So going around over here current current and say item item here and what we're going to right over

07:25.830 --> 07:33.440
here this is going to be a background and I'm going to say will be near gradient along this and this

07:33.440 --> 07:36.350
is going to be OUR be going here.

07:36.410 --> 07:43.070
So we're going to use a two fifty five 2 0 1 and 20.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.460
And like I said we can use whatever colors we would want.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.090
All right.

07:47.140 --> 07:54.390
So again we're here we're just using an R G B again the same thing 2:55.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.910
Then we have two and one.

07:56.020 --> 07:58.590
And then on here this going to be 20.

07:58.600 --> 08:02.860
So now once we have this we can just say it and you can see what happens.

08:02.860 --> 08:03.590
Right.

08:03.610 --> 08:09.000
Once we had all heard his background you can see that as the opacity changes actually we have a yellow

08:09.000 --> 08:10.500
background.

08:10.870 --> 08:12.640
Once we were done with this.

08:12.730 --> 08:15.950
Now let's add responsiveness.

08:15.950 --> 08:21.000
And in the next video can actually add magnifica pop up box.

08:21.010 --> 08:26.050
So first things first I'm going to say here that let's let's just say it.

08:26.440 --> 08:30.540
And again we have few options what to look at we can look at.

08:30.680 --> 08:31.900
All right.

08:31.930 --> 08:35.150
So you can see that everything is working just the images are really big.

08:35.230 --> 08:38.280
Right so we obviously need to do some kind of styling here.

08:38.290 --> 08:39.140
Right.

08:39.140 --> 08:46.430
So we're going to do when we're here is going to have a year media and now we're going to say screen

08:46.860 --> 08:55.330
rear end or you are going to see men with and with so many men with one that is going to happen so I'm

08:55.330 --> 09:05.390
going to say 576 pixels here and then we're going to have a corrent current and we're going to say Center.

09:05.730 --> 09:10.810
Let's just check whether the actual class matches or that was an ID.

09:11.020 --> 09:11.320
Right.

09:11.320 --> 09:11.950
That's correct.

09:11.950 --> 09:13.690
It's going to be an entity.

09:13.720 --> 09:18.670
So if we're going to go back on here to say current Center and over here then we're going to say like

09:18.700 --> 09:19.060
this.

09:19.080 --> 09:19.480
Right.

09:19.690 --> 09:26.110
So first of all in this play and we're going to say flex really miss so let's save it and let's see

09:26.110 --> 09:27.690
whether something changes.

09:27.770 --> 09:31.070
Right now I can see that we have one big line over here.

09:31.060 --> 09:32.440
These images.

09:32.440 --> 09:38.680
Now the next thing that I would want to do once actually display flex on here I'm going to say a justified

09:38.680 --> 09:47.120
content space between then after that we're going to see a flex wrap and we're going to say wrap around

09:47.360 --> 09:51.610
here and then we're going to have the actual worth of an item.

09:51.610 --> 10:00.180
So again let's make it a longer room more here and we're going to say corrent I got him here.

10:00.390 --> 10:01.990
And what would that mean for the current data.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.820
We're going to say flex 0 0 50 percent.

10:06.900 --> 10:13.860
All right so starting from the small screen this is going to be 50 percent say this year and we can

10:13.860 --> 10:18.180
refresh no here now we have a 50 percent.

10:18.180 --> 10:21.960
Now obviously for the bigger screen we would want a fourth the size right.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.350
So this is very straightforward.

10:24.560 --> 10:28.670
Can you just copy and paste needs to realize this.

10:28.950 --> 10:36.600
And here we're going to say that this is going to be a size of nine to nine and two then after that

10:37.380 --> 10:39.790
all these things stay the same.

10:39.940 --> 10:40.200
Right.

10:40.200 --> 10:44.790
Because we already send them on here with these rules so let's get this guy.

10:45.190 --> 10:49.080
Know he read 25 25 or here.

10:49.380 --> 10:53.670
So we're saying this now we should get a fourth to screen.

10:54.000 --> 10:54.300
Right.

10:54.360 --> 10:57.770
And sure enough this is going to be our fourth of the screen.

10:58.120 --> 11:06.450
And now let's go ahead let's actually comment this out and let's do the same thing just with the grid.

11:06.450 --> 11:10.140
So we're here all of them saying this is going to be a grid instead.

11:10.130 --> 11:20.790
So again media screen here and I'm saying and I know here you say men with with here.

11:20.830 --> 11:24.450
Same thing 576 pixels.

11:24.610 --> 11:29.160
And I would say we maybe could have commented out over here and leave the media screen.

11:29.170 --> 11:33.720
I don't know whether that would really save a bunch of time but we definitely could have done that.

11:33.730 --> 11:34.490
Right.

11:34.630 --> 11:39.900
Here we're going to we're going to stay current and we're going to say Center on first things first

11:39.900 --> 11:46.510
of all going to say this play and we're going to say great here once we have the actual grid when you

11:46.620 --> 11:55.270
say grid template and template columns are going to say repeat like this.

11:55.360 --> 11:59.140
All right so we're going to have a repeat and repeat.

11:59.140 --> 12:00.650
Is going to be for two.

12:00.910 --> 12:07.130
So two of them I know here one fraction we can write it like this or we could have just written on here

12:07.200 --> 12:08.570
like this one.

12:08.580 --> 12:10.880
Fraction one fraction right.

12:10.890 --> 12:13.750
So basically we're saying you want two columns.

12:13.750 --> 12:16.020
And both of them should be one fraction.

12:16.090 --> 12:16.420
No.

12:16.430 --> 12:20.740
Here we can do is just copy and paste this one here.

12:20.740 --> 12:24.380
Let's say that this is going to be 9 9 2 No here.

12:24.430 --> 12:26.900
Now let's use the actual repeat.

12:26.900 --> 12:27.160
Right.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.850
So again we can get rid of the grid.

12:30.020 --> 12:32.300
That's not what we care about here.

12:32.290 --> 12:36.380
All we want is repeat function here.

12:36.460 --> 12:40.230
Let's say four times and one fraction.

12:40.470 --> 12:41.400
That's right.

12:41.470 --> 12:44.850
So let's save this and let's go back over here.

12:45.340 --> 12:47.450
And now you can see what we have right.

12:47.470 --> 12:49.680
We have everything still working the same way.

12:49.700 --> 12:53.270
Right now I can see that as I'm hovering it is showing as a link.

12:53.270 --> 12:53.850
All right.

12:53.860 --> 12:58.420
And if I press it I actually go to where the actual image is located.

12:58.660 --> 12:59.890
But that's not what we want.

12:59.890 --> 13:00.620
Right.

13:00.720 --> 13:05.880
In the next video we're actually going to place more here our magnifique pop up.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.650
So we have the actual responsive gallery.
