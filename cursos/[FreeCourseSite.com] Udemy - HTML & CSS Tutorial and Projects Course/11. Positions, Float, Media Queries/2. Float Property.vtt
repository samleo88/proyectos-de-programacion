WEBVTT

00:00.720 --> 00:01.390
All right.

00:01.390 --> 00:04.130
First on our agenda is gonna be the flow property.

00:04.140 --> 00:09.740
I'm going to start very simply by creating some kind of Dave can actually give it a class let's say

00:09.760 --> 00:14.620
class again is gonna be something like manner then within the better we're going to place our image

00:14.680 --> 00:16.840
and we're gonna go with a small one.

00:16.840 --> 00:22.840
So let's say source we're looking for small let's go to the image name and then let's write.

00:22.850 --> 00:26.770
No no whatever some kind of alternative so small image.

00:26.770 --> 00:31.360
And by the way I know that I have been avoiding alternatives all the time so that's probably something

00:31.360 --> 00:32.550
we should always add.

00:32.770 --> 00:34.320
What was in the small image.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.650
Just double check.

00:35.710 --> 00:40.700
So we had some kind of mountains let's say and this is gonna be nice view.

00:40.860 --> 00:43.640
It's gonna be a text some nice view.

00:43.670 --> 00:45.100
Okay so far so good.

00:45.130 --> 00:47.830
And once I say it obviously this is gonna be my image.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.060
Now what else I would like here.

00:49.300 --> 00:52.330
Well I'm gonna say paragraph for the paragraph.

00:52.330 --> 00:55.870
I don't know 50 words that should do I say.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.580
So now we have the program.

00:57.830 --> 01:02.200
We already know that the reason why we're having the margins here and the reason why we're starting

01:02.200 --> 01:05.740
new line is because paragraph is block level.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.610
But let me throw you a mind Gurney.

01:08.620 --> 01:10.460
I'm gonna head over back to Celsius.

01:10.510 --> 01:17.910
First we're gonna select the winner and then for the banner I would like to have just some kind of water.

01:18.040 --> 01:22.090
The border is it gonna be five pixels solid.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.510
And as always I'm gonna go with the red.

01:24.640 --> 01:30.640
And let me add maybe a little bit of padding let's say padding is gonna be 10 pixels all around.

01:30.640 --> 01:33.340
Now what happens if we use the float property.

01:33.340 --> 01:38.560
Well I can just say for the image since I have an image that I would like to float it and I can just

01:38.560 --> 01:42.240
say flow and then we're looking for a few options here.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.560
Let me get my suggestions again.

01:44.560 --> 01:50.610
Let's say float and float we have left we have right and we have not.

01:50.680 --> 01:56.770
Now you would be tempted to say that this is already floated to the real left because what's happening

01:56.770 --> 01:59.020
is that image is already floated to the left.

01:59.290 --> 02:01.750
However by default we have for all of them.

02:02.440 --> 02:05.210
Now do you want me to project what happens here.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.560
So I'm gonna save it float it to the left.

02:07.600 --> 02:08.650
Now check this out.

02:08.950 --> 02:15.760
Even though the paragraph supposed to be a block level moment where this is starting a new line right

02:15.790 --> 02:20.200
now it took the element out in our case image out of the normal flow.

02:20.710 --> 02:23.860
So now the paragraph is actually wrapping around.

02:23.860 --> 02:30.520
Now if we don't want this look then we would need to go for what we have an option of clear.

02:30.610 --> 02:36.550
So for the paragraph I would say that I would want to use the clear and then I have few options I can

02:36.550 --> 02:37.860
have clear both.

02:37.900 --> 02:41.650
So in that case if there is going to be let's say two elements that have been one floated to the left

02:41.680 --> 02:46.060
and I want the right or I'm going to be looking for the actual flow direction.

02:46.060 --> 02:50.670
So in this case if I floated to the left I would need to write that I would want to clear it.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.170
Also on the left hand side.

02:52.490 --> 02:58.690
So now I'm having back again the look that I had before where the paragraph was actually respecting

02:58.690 --> 03:01.550
the fact that it was starting in your line.

03:01.570 --> 03:06.280
Now if I'm gonna make him let's say mistake and right there I would want to clear it from the right

03:06.670 --> 03:07.200
notice.

03:07.210 --> 03:09.570
Again this is not going to work well this case.

03:09.570 --> 03:12.310
This is not going to work because I wrote it incorrectly.

03:12.310 --> 03:19.750
This should be g h t but still what's happening is that even though I use the clear property my value

03:19.750 --> 03:20.730
was incorrect.

03:20.890 --> 03:27.040
So that's something you need to remember that if you're lowering something let's say in one direction

03:27.490 --> 03:33.760
if you want the next element to clear it and start a normal flow of documents like it should be.

03:33.820 --> 03:38.160
You also need to use the right or left property in our case.

03:38.170 --> 03:39.400
That would be the left.

03:39.400 --> 03:45.580
So now we have the paragraph that is actually respecting that it needs to start in your mind just like

03:45.580 --> 03:46.540
it should.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.570
So let's start out with a right one.

03:49.570 --> 03:52.200
Let's say that I'm going to be looking on the right and again.

03:52.240 --> 03:56.560
Same thing happens is because we're using for the Clear left.

03:56.620 --> 03:58.970
So now the paragraph actually goes up.

03:59.020 --> 04:03.780
So if I'm going to again use the right that would be the correct one notice.

04:03.790 --> 04:05.750
Again we're going to be starring in your line.

04:06.250 --> 04:08.640
What else we'll have when we have an option of.

04:08.680 --> 04:14.230
Like I said if there's going to be let's say two of them we can use something like both.

04:14.230 --> 04:15.530
Now where we'll do that.

04:15.610 --> 04:16.060
I don't know.

04:16.060 --> 04:21.430
We can head over to indexation AML and we can copy paste this image.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.690
Then there's gonna be two small images.

04:23.710 --> 04:29.720
Now one is gonna be let's say with a class of first just to show you kind of how everything would work.

04:29.890 --> 04:31.740
We're gonna add a class.

04:31.780 --> 04:33.600
It's gonna be one.

04:33.970 --> 04:35.820
This is gonna be number two.

04:35.830 --> 04:37.630
Now what's gonna happen right now.

04:37.630 --> 04:41.130
Well both of them first of all gonna be floated to the left side by side.

04:41.150 --> 04:47.110
Well I'm sorry to late because we added float right but in my case now we want to use the class of 1.

04:47.800 --> 04:52.740
So I'm going to say that only the first one is gonna be floated to the right and then this guy is gonna

04:52.750 --> 04:53.560
stay.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.190
So everything is working fine.

04:55.210 --> 05:02.240
However if I'm going to say two and also I'm gonna float it to the left so floated to the left.

05:02.330 --> 05:08.030
Now again the reason why we have normal everything because if we have cleared both what we found right.

05:08.030 --> 05:12.360
Just clear right now is where our tax is gonna be sitting right now.

05:13.010 --> 05:13.730
All right.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.400
And now my tax is sitting exactly in the middle.

05:16.400 --> 05:24.020
Because even though it is avoiding the actual one that we have on the right hand side it's not avoiding

05:24.020 --> 05:25.480
the left one.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.010
Well you might say this is not true.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.630
I can see where starting new line.

05:29.900 --> 05:30.180
OK.

05:30.200 --> 05:35.610
What if I go here on a number two and let's say that the height is going to be 300.

05:35.690 --> 05:37.530
What is gonna happen right now.

05:37.550 --> 05:39.590
Now my image is really big.

05:39.590 --> 05:46.160
So even though we're starting a new line because there is the one on the right the left one is still

05:46.430 --> 05:48.170
not being taken care of.

05:48.170 --> 05:51.860
So in this case if we would want to avoid that we would say clear both.

05:51.860 --> 05:56.470
And now we finally have our paragraph where we have as normal next time.

05:56.960 --> 06:02.120
Now it's really up to you if you want to float it to the left and have paragraph side by side.

06:02.150 --> 06:08.060
That is also an option just to quickly show you though if we're gonna go bigger with this image right

06:08.060 --> 06:08.300
now.

06:08.650 --> 06:12.140
If let's say I'm going to go with thousand is gonna be my head.

06:12.180 --> 06:18.440
Notice that this is pretty much really going to be big and it's gonna leave actually.

06:18.440 --> 06:19.190
Also my dear.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.250
So what would be the suggestion how we can fix that.

06:22.700 --> 06:29.960
Well we have an option here of overflow and hitting so that way the image whenever it's gonna be getting

06:29.960 --> 06:37.220
too big for the parent if we can use this overflow with the value of hidden and now at least the image

06:37.220 --> 06:39.440
is gonna stay within the bounds of this day.

06:39.560 --> 06:45.320
Now again this was a little bit too drastic let's say 300 and you know what I can just get rid of the

06:45.320 --> 06:50.490
second one just to show you how we can do with him side by side so let's say there's not gonna be anymore

06:50.580 --> 06:57.260
the second one and now we we're going to imagine the scenario where we want them side by side so we

06:57.260 --> 06:59.420
like to look how everything looks great.

06:59.450 --> 07:01.470
So we have floated here this one to the left.

07:01.490 --> 07:04.660
So this was fine or you don't want to the right.

07:04.850 --> 07:09.590
We can delete the second one we don't need it anymore and we also don't need to clear property.

07:09.590 --> 07:13.580
Let's say that this is exactly how you would want would want them side by side.

07:13.740 --> 07:17.030
Now we can always do nicely is to have some kind of margin.

07:17.570 --> 07:24.320
So for number one I can say margin and let's say margin left is gonna be I don't know 50 pixels so that

07:24.320 --> 07:30.140
way I can get more margins in between them if that's something you like and that's in general how we're

07:30.140 --> 07:31.580
gonna work with a float.
