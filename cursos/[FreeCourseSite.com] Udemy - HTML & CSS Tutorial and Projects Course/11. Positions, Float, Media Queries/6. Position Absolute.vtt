00:00.730 --> 00:02.110
A okay.

00:02.120 --> 00:06.270
If you thought that position relative was somewhat fun.

00:06.470 --> 00:07.310
Wait till you meet.

00:07.310 --> 00:12.540
Position absolute which is in my opinion a real rock star in a sea of sex.

00:12.590 --> 00:14.000
What do I mean by that.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.530
Well let's take a closer look.

00:16.550 --> 00:22.520
First I would like to get rid of this relative or we can just delete it maybe altogether later on.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.470
Actually throw out this video and add it back.

00:24.470 --> 00:27.700
But for now just to show you how everything is going work.

00:27.770 --> 00:33.260
I will gonna delete this position relative where does position upload come into play.

00:33.260 --> 00:38.690
First I'm gonna go to the special one since this was the reason why we added it and then let's say position

00:38.690 --> 00:39.530
here.

00:39.530 --> 00:45.080
Since this is our option or position then for position we're not going to go with the relative where

00:45.100 --> 00:48.020
we're going and go for absolute.

00:48.040 --> 00:54.800
Now once we say it notice what happens already we're having some interesting changes NOW OKAY SO FAR

00:54.800 --> 00:55.630
SO GOOD.

00:55.640 --> 00:56.430
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:56.930 --> 01:05.150
WELL WITH position absolute we're also placing this position relative or on this position relative to

01:05.150 --> 01:09.290
the nearest ancestor that has the position relative.

01:09.290 --> 01:16.040
Now if position absolute cannot find that ancestor if it doesn't exist then it places itself relative

01:16.070 --> 01:17.240
to the body.

01:17.250 --> 01:22.910
Now if for checking here in the next animal how many ancestors does this plan has.

01:22.910 --> 01:29.150
Well it has the first one the parent with the class of number two then it has the div which is the second

01:29.150 --> 01:34.060
one and then since none of them have position relative then it looks for the body.

01:34.130 --> 01:35.530
Now you don't believe me.

01:35.630 --> 01:36.530
Let's test it out.

01:36.710 --> 01:42.650
So here we go in all right top since again these are our properties for the manipulation of the position.

01:42.890 --> 01:47.960
And let's say for the top is gonna be easier because we can add any kind of value and we can also add

01:47.960 --> 01:48.740
zero.

01:48.740 --> 01:52.910
So let's say top 0 and right is also gonna be 0.

01:53.090 --> 01:56.090
Let's see what's gonna happen and what happened.

01:56.090 --> 02:04.250
Well the absolute special of the special class with position absolute moved all the way to the top right

02:04.250 --> 02:10.850
corner of the body because like I said if there's not gonna be an ancestor that basically is going to

02:11.330 --> 02:15.740
work as a position relative then we're not going to be able to capture that.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.150
You want me to show you Mark.

02:18.440 --> 02:23.280
So if indexation email I had position number two or class number two for the paragraph.

02:23.750 --> 02:29.090
If we're gonna head over back to the C assess and if we're in the right position and in this case this

02:29.090 --> 02:31.320
is going to be relative notice what's gonna happen.

02:31.370 --> 02:38.720
So now this span with a class of special is gonna be sitting in the same position with position absolute

02:39.110 --> 02:41.480
and top right corner 0 0.

02:41.840 --> 02:45.000
However this is gonna happen within this paragraph.

02:45.020 --> 02:50.920
We have a class of 2 and the reason for that because we added this class of relative where I'm sorry

02:50.930 --> 02:53.060
we added the position of relative.

02:53.060 --> 02:56.750
Now what's gonna happen if I'm going to remove it again it's gonna go back to the body.

02:57.290 --> 03:01.820
Well we can also test it out on the dev let's do the same thing we're going to say that the position

03:01.820 --> 03:06.800
is not going to be static and instead of going to change it and I was gonna say that this is going to

03:06.800 --> 03:07.340
be relative.

03:07.730 --> 03:10.750
So now this is saying zero and zero.

03:10.880 --> 03:16.340
However within the div now nothing is gonna happen if we're going to place here the position relative

03:16.340 --> 03:20.070
in one because what we need is the actual ancestor.

03:20.300 --> 03:24.570
In this case this is just gonna be a sibling for the class of Number Two program.

03:24.580 --> 03:27.580
This is not going to be an ancestor for this class of special.

03:27.620 --> 03:33.770
So that's the reason where whenever we play something with a position absolute.

03:33.770 --> 03:39.470
If we don't want it to be placed relative to the Murray we need to have some kind of parent element

03:39.500 --> 03:43.580
or transistor element that's going to have a class of relative.

03:43.610 --> 03:49.010
I'm sorry the position of a relative and just to show you that we can actually place it in the body

03:49.010 --> 03:50.890
again wherever we would like.

03:50.990 --> 03:58.920
First of all let me change it that I know 50 percent here let's say 50 percent up and 50 percent bottom.

03:59.000 --> 03:59.630
Or I'm sorry.

03:59.630 --> 04:00.310
Right.

04:00.440 --> 04:05.720
And this is gonna place it somewhere here and you can see that there is one thing missing and that one

04:05.720 --> 04:11.330
thing is the fact that we haven't looked at a transform properly yet and we will gonna look sooner because

04:11.330 --> 04:14.920
at the moment you can say well it's technically not sitting in the center.

04:14.930 --> 04:19.760
That is correct because we would need to shift a little bit the position of this element.

04:20.180 --> 04:26.180
However this is close enough for the Center for us just to show you that we can use any kind of values

04:26.560 --> 04:30.080
whether it be percentages will or just is going to be pixel again.

04:30.080 --> 04:35.690
Really anything you would like and then this time I can just remove the relative and you'll see that

04:35.690 --> 04:42.500
this is gonna be sitting pretty much all the way in the center here of the body because again there

04:42.500 --> 04:46.220
is no answers there that does have this position relative.

04:46.220 --> 04:49.380
So this is not placed relative to those answers there.

04:49.520 --> 04:54.600
Now one thing though in the next video we're going to be looking at position fixed in this case.

04:54.620 --> 04:59.080
If you place it here with this position top let's say 50 50.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.830
This is gonna disappear as we're scrolling.

05:01.890 --> 05:05.310
So if we're gonna be adding more elements here and there is going to be scrolling down.

05:05.520 --> 05:10.860
This element with a glass of special he is actually going to disappear as we're scrolling.

05:10.980 --> 05:13.920
So it's gonna be callable our weird position fixed.

05:13.920 --> 05:16.530
What's gonna happen is that the element is gonna stay.

05:17.040 --> 05:20.760
So even though we're placing right now relative to the body.

05:20.910 --> 05:23.840
This is not gonna stay on a page as we're scrolling down.
