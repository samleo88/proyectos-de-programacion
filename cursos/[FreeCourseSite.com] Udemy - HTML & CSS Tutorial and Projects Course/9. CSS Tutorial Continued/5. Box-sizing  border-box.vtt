00:00.240 --> 00:05.520
In the previous video I mentioned that we will going to cover the bulk sizing and we're going gonna

00:05.520 --> 00:12.390
make it actually with an example because like always and I know I keep repeating this but it makes much

00:12.390 --> 00:19.230
more sense if we're looking actually at the example now what we would like to do here I guess again

00:19.230 --> 00:20.530
for the whole CEO.

00:20.850 --> 00:23.190
I'm just gonna delete this.

00:23.190 --> 00:27.600
We're also gonna go to the next page CML I'm going to say we're not going to need these on our list

00:27.990 --> 00:30.720
but instead we're going to create a device.

00:30.750 --> 00:34.560
In fact there's going to be three days or the day of let's say first box.

00:34.560 --> 00:40.680
No one is going to be in class and let's write here with a hearing one simple text.

00:40.680 --> 00:48.630
I am with I am with border box water box.

00:48.870 --> 00:50.220
Then the next one.

00:50.280 --> 00:53.880
Let me just copy and paste it and let's copy and paste it two times.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.550
So the second day is out.

00:55.570 --> 01:00.450
They're going to be with box of number two and the third one is gonna be with a box of three.

01:00.450 --> 01:03.060
And again we'll just use this for styling here.

01:03.060 --> 01:07.050
Let's just say I'm normal I am normal.

01:07.270 --> 01:14.260
And then for the third one let's write I am without water box and we're gonna say it.

01:14.510 --> 01:14.900
Okay.

01:14.940 --> 01:20.030
So we have three divs within the three layers we have heading once again the most work is gonna be in

01:20.040 --> 01:20.960
style C is this.

01:21.180 --> 01:27.630
And let's start styling first and foremost let's select marks on what's in the right box number one.

01:27.630 --> 01:34.590
Now since I would like to have multiple styles for each and every box let me repeat maybe when we can

01:34.590 --> 01:41.700
group the elements let's just say box number two and we're gonna write a dot again box number two as

01:41.700 --> 01:46.400
well as comma and box number three and just keep forgetting the dots.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.880
But I think it's gonna be okay.

01:49.060 --> 01:53.330
Now what I would want for all the classes because again that was the whole point of this grouping.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.530
So I'm going to say two hundred pixels is gonna be my worth.

01:56.590 --> 02:01.600
Then we're also gonna do I don't know height of the same of 200 pixels.

02:01.690 --> 02:02.410
Excellent.

02:02.410 --> 02:04.410
We have the width and we have the height.

02:04.420 --> 02:05.360
Now what.

02:05.390 --> 02:05.880
No maybe.

02:05.890 --> 02:12.250
Let's add some colors but for the colors and they are gonna be separate on one to actually select the

02:12.250 --> 02:19.360
actual boxes on their own marks no one is gonna have the background of let's say red then we're also

02:19.360 --> 02:24.510
gonna add a little bit of coloring we white so that's gonna be this style and you know what.

02:24.520 --> 02:29.380
In this case we can just copy paste it because there's no point of rewriting everything so we can say

02:29.380 --> 02:35.200
that I would like to select whatever D lines and we're gonna copy and paste it two times then let's

02:35.200 --> 02:41.020
write different values so this would be Box Number two there's gonna be box number three and you know

02:41.020 --> 02:46.610
what actually changed my mind why don't we do this one hundred pixels because you'll see actually now

02:46.630 --> 02:47.440
you can undo it.

02:47.470 --> 02:53.140
My apologies I need to go two hundred pixels because I have everyone please disregard whatever I just

02:53.140 --> 03:00.040
did and back to the colors now for the second one will going to add maybe I don't know blue color and

03:00.040 --> 03:01.710
text it's not gonna be white.

03:01.810 --> 03:07.480
So here we can also do the green now as we're looking at it first of all you can see that I messed up

03:07.960 --> 03:14.800
I could have used the color right here I could have said color and white and let me just spend 30 seconds

03:15.310 --> 03:20.920
to delete these guys so again we'll select them with multiple selectors and we'll just gonna delete

03:20.920 --> 03:24.520
them since all the colors are gonna be exactly the same.

03:24.520 --> 03:31.010
Now comes the most interesting part of where we're starting to work with the border box so why were

03:31.040 --> 03:37.690
using that property and why we're using the actual property as well as the value so why we're using

03:37.690 --> 03:43.990
the box sizing property with the value of the more box now in order to demonstrate this why don't we

03:43.990 --> 03:50.110
add some padding now for the box number one which was gonna be watermarks and then for the box number

03:50.110 --> 03:55.030
three so leave the middle one the box number two just the way it is.

03:55.190 --> 04:00.130
So here I'm gonna say like this I'm going to say that I would like some padding and I'm gonna add padding

04:00.130 --> 04:07.240
all around I'm gonna say twenty pixels now OK so I am really noticing that my box is getting bigger

04:07.720 --> 04:14.260
OK let's do the same thing here let's say for the third box is also going to be the same thing and again

04:14.290 --> 04:20.170
we're getting the bigger padding on the left hand side as well as we can see that it's happening on

04:20.170 --> 04:21.280
top of bottom.

04:21.640 --> 04:27.910
Now if we really want to actually check this out we can head over to the bigger browser window or you

04:27.910 --> 04:33.100
can do it in a small side browser window it's really up to you and then we can again refresh how we

04:33.100 --> 04:39.610
can go to Google Developer Tools and if I'm going to click on inspect I'm gonna open up the doors I'm

04:39.610 --> 04:44.470
gonna right away zoom in so we can see better and that was a little bit drastic I didn't need to go

04:44.470 --> 04:52.690
that far but we can stay something I cannot pick the right angle let's say head within the head I'm

04:52.690 --> 04:59.070
not interested in anything I don't know why open hand actually needed body let me open up the body now

04:59.070 --> 05:07.260
within the body I have my boxes what do you see here on the box now if you can clearly see on the top.

05:07.340 --> 05:10.940
I have 240 by 240.

05:11.210 --> 05:14.550
However on my right hand side it says 200 by 200.

05:14.690 --> 05:20.660
Again let me heard a hover over back and as I'm hovering over the elements you can see that there has

05:20.660 --> 05:26.270
been added some weight and some height because we just had at the padding because I said padding is

05:26.270 --> 05:28.600
going to be left and right and top and bottom.

05:28.670 --> 05:32.480
So what happens is even though originally it was 200 by 200.

05:32.630 --> 05:38.030
Now in fact this is 240 by 240 because we added the padding okay.

05:38.040 --> 05:38.630
Don't believe me.

05:38.630 --> 05:41.690
Let's go over to box number three again.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.790
Same deal.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.730
So even though I'm having here right now there's two hundred two hundred.

05:46.790 --> 05:53.630
What's happening is on the page right now as I'm looking at it again this is 240 by 240 and we can also

05:53.630 --> 05:54.940
see this over here.

05:55.100 --> 06:02.740
So I have 200 by 200 but then my pairings are being added on the left hand side and right hand side.

06:02.810 --> 06:04.200
It's obviously different.

06:04.280 --> 06:09.560
It's the opposite the left hand side in the right hand side as well as top and bottom.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.380
Now why this matters.

06:11.400 --> 06:16.080
Well has you're going to be working with CSX as you're going to be working with your layout.

06:16.110 --> 06:22.470
This is really going to mess you up especially if you try to position something somewhere and you just

06:22.560 --> 06:23.280
add a padding.

06:23.280 --> 06:30.270
And this is totally going to mess up your layout your view and probably most importantly your mood especially

06:30.270 --> 06:31.160
in the beginning.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.880
So what do we do about that.

06:33.360 --> 06:38.850
Well let me head over to the box number one over here and let's have the property that we just learned

06:39.150 --> 06:45.060
which was box sizing property and for the box sizing we would like to add Border box.

06:45.060 --> 06:47.130
Now what is border bugs do.

06:47.130 --> 06:52.620
Well what happens with border box border box is right now and we can actually click on box number one

06:53.010 --> 06:54.330
and now check this out.

06:54.330 --> 06:55.700
Now this is probably going to be clear.

06:55.710 --> 07:01.050
But even though you can still see it here at least I can see it down my window I can see that this is

07:01.050 --> 07:02.540
still 200 by 200.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.660
But I guess this is going to be a little bit better.

07:04.700 --> 07:11.220
We notice what happens now the padding is added on inside so the content is actually 160 which again

07:11.550 --> 07:16.470
might mess you up your content but then but at least it's not going to mess up your whole layout.

07:16.650 --> 07:19.530
Now is it the same thing with the third one.

07:19.530 --> 07:19.920
Well no.

07:19.950 --> 07:22.440
This is still without a border box value.

07:22.530 --> 07:27.960
So what's happening is this is the reason why we're using the border box and that's the reason why in

07:27.960 --> 07:33.540
the beginning remember when we had that universal selector when we said that we would want to select

07:33.540 --> 07:36.120
everything and that was the Asterix.

07:36.120 --> 07:39.350
Then we're adding margin is going to be zero.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.240
The default margins should be gone.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.070
Then also the padding should be gone.

07:43.080 --> 07:46.670
So we can always add their own padding and that's why we added.

07:46.670 --> 07:50.880
Here is box sizing with a value of the border box.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.150
So that's why we said here mortar box.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.280
So no all of them are exactly the same.

07:55.290 --> 08:00.720
The only difference right now with a one in three is the fact that the padding has been added on the

08:00.720 --> 08:01.500
inside.

08:01.500 --> 08:07.660
But the key is that if you're adding this property it will not gonna mess up your whole layout.

08:07.830 --> 08:15.000
If you're adding padding to a element because padding is gonna be applied inside of the element not

08:15.000 --> 08:16.860
the outside making the element bigger.
