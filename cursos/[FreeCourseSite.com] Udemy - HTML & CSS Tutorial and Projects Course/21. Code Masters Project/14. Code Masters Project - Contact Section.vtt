00:44.850 --> 00:48.780
Once we press the tab then we have two articles over here.

00:48.780 --> 00:49.440

00:49.470 --> 01:00.110
So within the contact center then we're going to have article of contact info contact info here.

01:00.210 --> 01:06.320

We're going to.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.590

02:22.920 --> 02:27.450
Then we're going to have a few paragraphs to say here.

02:27.480 --> 02:36.450
This is going to be paragraph would say four or five six in some street name.

02:36.460 --> 02:36.950

02:36.990 --> 02:38.430
Again select the line.

02:38.460 --> 02:40.010
Copy and paste the line.

02:40.380 --> 02:42.210
Let's say two more times.

02:42.490 --> 02:50.060
He'll going to read that this is going to be state and country overrides state country and then we'll

02:50.070 --> 02:51.200
have a zip code.

02:51.340 --> 02:52.310
And so here we're going.

02:52.320 --> 02:57.130
I know this is going to be zip code zip code over here.

02:57.150 --> 03:02.730
Now once we have this more here now what we want to create a second one right.

03:02.760 --> 03:08.300
So what we can do here we can just get content detail where it ends like this.

03:08.370 --> 03:09.810
Copy and paste this.

03:09.960 --> 03:11.440
And here we're going to write different.

03:11.440 --> 03:11.650
Right.

03:11.650 --> 03:19.960
So icon is going to be phoned for one more here and then we're going to say call us here.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.610
So I'm going to do this.

03:21.690 --> 03:27.280
Call us here then we'll get the name of the person on the right.

03:27.280 --> 03:34.740
Just one name of the person the name of the person that this is going to be the phone number which is

03:34.740 --> 03:36.340
going to be bunch of trees.

03:36.450 --> 03:41.510
So we're going to have plus 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.

03:41.530 --> 03:42.290
All right.

03:42.290 --> 03:47.440
Monday to Friday Monday to Friday.

03:47.740 --> 03:53.550
On this I don't want to say 8 0 0 to say 22.

03:53.690 --> 03:56.820
All right so 22 0 0.

03:57.090 --> 04:01.100
Once we have this now let's start working with an actual form.

04:01.130 --> 04:01.500
Right.

04:01.530 --> 04:07.380
So again let's find out if this one was a info.

04:07.630 --> 04:11.930
All right so this one was article and then this is going to be the forum.

04:12.090 --> 04:16.560
And what are we going to write in a forum or here we're going to say first that this is going to be

04:16.650 --> 04:18.860
a contact us.

04:19.170 --> 04:23.670
So having three contact here and let's write it.

04:23.670 --> 04:26.530
Contact us right.

04:26.610 --> 04:33.270
They're going to create a form element will have no action or here we can leave this one blank and in

04:33.270 --> 04:40.250
the form we're going to write a input we're going to here and put them on tape is going to be text.

04:40.440 --> 04:45.750
Well here the first thing we're going to say that this is going to be ID and this is going to be equal

04:45.750 --> 04:47.650
to a name.

04:47.750 --> 04:53.460
So I'm going to say this is going to be name then the placeholder is going to be first names are going

04:53.490 --> 05:00.870
to say first and we're going to say name here and then next thing they want to do is do the same thing

05:00.870 --> 05:02.300
with the last name.

05:02.300 --> 05:06.820
And so if this was the first name now we're going to write it this is going to be the last time.

05:06.840 --> 05:13.080
So I asked for her name I.D. type is going to be still text are you going to write it.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.500
This is my last name.

05:15.510 --> 05:16.480
My name.

05:16.530 --> 05:17.920
Copy and paste.

05:18.030 --> 05:19.720
And we're going to this is going to be e-mail.

05:19.860 --> 05:28.450
So the I.D. is going to be mail and placeholder is going to be e-mail address here.

05:28.490 --> 05:32.530
This is going to be e-mail address.

05:32.760 --> 05:36.000
And then this type also going to me.

05:36.450 --> 05:38.440
And then we'll will have a textarea.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.680
So after that we're going to have a new one.

05:40.680 --> 05:47.080
So this is going to be text area and name is going to be textarea or you know what.

05:47.110 --> 05:49.590
Let's cover the name of comments.

05:49.800 --> 05:57.470
And he's also going to be comments comments comments here.

05:57.780 --> 06:01.950
Then place holder is going to be your message.

06:01.950 --> 06:10.960
So going right over here placeholder your work message or here then after that we would want a button

06:11.470 --> 06:13.350
and this is going to be submit.

06:13.540 --> 06:22.810
So when you say button and type is going to be submit type here submit and then we're going to send

06:22.810 --> 06:25.200
a message send message.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.090
All right.

06:26.230 --> 06:32.490
Once we have our HDMI and ready we can go head to main CSSA and.

06:32.830 --> 06:37.550
So I'm going to go back over here and go obviously all the way to the bottom.

06:37.570 --> 06:40.280
You can create more space over here.

06:40.780 --> 06:44.680
So it's created more space so we can have something to work with.

06:44.980 --> 06:48.260
And over here I'm going to say that this is going to be common.

06:48.620 --> 06:48.930
All right.

06:48.940 --> 06:50.630
So we're here.

06:50.630 --> 06:54.980
Hash tag contact hash tag more over here.

06:55.210 --> 06:57.940
And then one by one I was going to style this right.

06:58.120 --> 07:01.390
So I'm going to start with a contact here like this.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.000
Right.

07:02.060 --> 07:03.070
And let's just check with.

07:03.080 --> 07:08.530
We have the actual class where we have an ID and on here everything is fine.

07:08.530 --> 07:09.810
This is a class.

07:09.870 --> 07:16.160
So once we saw like contact parding is going to be hundred pixels or zero.

07:16.320 --> 07:21.630
So top bottom and left right zero background.

07:21.830 --> 07:24.280
And over here we're going to do the same thing.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.050
As for the projects.

07:26.050 --> 07:30.730
All right so we're going to have a background but we're going to use one of the project images so I'm

07:30.730 --> 07:35.270
going to say we're here project one or here like this right now.

07:35.290 --> 07:37.560
Once we have this we're here we're going to write it.

07:37.560 --> 07:49.990
This is going to be center here Culver then we're going to have fixed and no repeat no repeat here like

07:49.990 --> 07:50.670
this.

07:50.860 --> 07:58.300
Once we have the macro now we would want a linear region and all just going to place another black color

07:58.300 --> 08:03.230
right so we can right away just go ahead and copy this guy here right.

08:03.490 --> 08:05.910
All the way to the comma.

08:06.070 --> 08:08.510
I just copy and paste this.

08:08.510 --> 08:13.330
I was going to go back over here and I can see we have dark background in or here and we're going to

08:13.330 --> 08:17.820
say it is color Ashlock 5 3 5.

08:18.070 --> 08:19.270
Well that's right.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.400
So this is going to be for the color.

08:21.400 --> 08:33.850
Now what we would want is so like the contact info here come the contact form or both articles contact

08:33.850 --> 08:37.270
form or what we would want to hear.

08:37.290 --> 08:48.100
I want to say margin 40 pixels and zero writes only top bottom for both of them then by adding 20 pixels

08:48.490 --> 08:49.920
and 40 pixels.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.150
We're like this.

08:51.180 --> 08:51.620
Right.

08:51.820 --> 09:00.900
So top bottom 20 40 on the site then we're going to say for the contact detail contact going to see

09:00.940 --> 09:01.840
detail.

09:02.140 --> 09:08.740
So this is going to be the div that holds the icon and or here this text.

09:08.740 --> 09:09.400
All right.

09:09.400 --> 09:14.700
First all we're going to say this play I'm going to say flex flex here.

09:14.910 --> 09:20.170
We'll have margin 20 pixels and let's say zero 0 0 like this.

09:20.170 --> 09:20.600
Right.

09:20.770 --> 09:26.830
So now I can see that this is how we're going to be lining up right now after that we would want to

09:26.830 --> 09:33.980
do is what we're going to say that this is going to be a different one right because you see here there's

09:34.000 --> 09:35.140
a little bit of a mistake.

09:35.170 --> 09:42.930
All right if we're going to go back over here in exchange the amount here this is the contact info.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.860
All right then this is the contact details.

09:45.910 --> 09:52.970
Right now what I would want to do is actually create or hear a div right.

09:53.080 --> 09:55.740
That actually holds it like.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.390
So this is there shouldn't be a contact text somewhere right.

09:59.420 --> 10:05.310
If this is a contact info I want contact and we're going to set text or here right.

10:05.410 --> 10:09.570
Press and now would you would want is copy this guy or here.

10:09.570 --> 10:10.190
All right.

10:10.220 --> 10:16.110
So I'm going to grab this or here we're going to say cut and we're going to copy and paste it over here.

10:16.150 --> 10:20.310
Right now I can see that actually there side by side and everything is work right.

10:20.500 --> 10:25.070
Because we don't want that many children here.

10:25.180 --> 10:30.910
We want only to one contact info for the contact detail and the other one contact text.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.590
So we need to do the same thing or here right.

10:33.610 --> 10:35.600
So contact info lines over here.

10:35.740 --> 10:44.160
So then you say contact I'm going to say text press tab now again grab all these here.

10:44.260 --> 10:44.960
Copy.

10:45.040 --> 10:51.830
Or you know what let's actually cut it out right and let's paste it over here.

10:51.860 --> 10:52.150
All right.

10:52.180 --> 10:54.250
And now both of them are side by side.

10:54.400 --> 11:01.600
So we say this and we're going to go back to main success and let's keep on styling.

11:01.630 --> 11:04.980
So here what you would want for the info.

11:05.260 --> 11:17.110
So if say contract I'm going to say I can more you than font size is going to be 50 font size 50 pixels

11:17.620 --> 11:18.520
like this.

11:18.900 --> 11:28.510
Then you will have a margin right when 20 pixels are here then you have a line cell phone with say Center.

11:28.730 --> 11:34.120
The reason why we're centering so you can see it's not stretched out right now right now the icons are

11:34.120 --> 11:35.620
exactly in the center.

11:35.720 --> 11:46.850
Now once we're done with this one contact text adding three more here and we're going to say text transform.

11:46.980 --> 11:55.660
We're going to capitalize on it this margin bottom 20 pixels or here like this.

11:55.660 --> 12:01.480
Once we once we're done with this now I would want to work with contact form or here we're going to

12:01.480 --> 12:02.930
say contact.

12:02.970 --> 12:08.530
I want to say for like this and this is going to be a background.

12:08.980 --> 12:17.770
And we're going to say hashtag 5 3 5 wheeling this putting zero like this.

12:17.830 --> 12:26.600
We're here to say with is going to be 80 percent on this then margin is zero.

12:26.890 --> 12:33.400
So we're going to place it again in the center without any pantings and then we're going to have a margin

12:34.120 --> 12:40.290
I'm sorry border radios more radios is going to be 20 pixels.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.920
It Right so these are going to be these edges.

12:42.970 --> 12:48.570
And next one we would want to work with contact form heading through here or here.

12:48.670 --> 12:49.240
Right.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.690
So we're going to go back over here.

12:51.790 --> 13:01.490
We're going to say contact one adding three more here now here we're going to say with 100 percent more

13:02.430 --> 13:06.720
than background and we're going to say the background is going to be the blue color.

13:06.910 --> 13:13.810
So this is going to be 8 1/2 sea beef CD DVD.

13:14.020 --> 13:26.560
All this takes the line center then text transform capitalized text transform capitalize on your ass

13:27.230 --> 13:35.750
then putting 20 pixels then border top radius 20 pixels and left and right because you can see or hear

13:35.750 --> 13:38.080
now or edges have disappeared.

13:38.270 --> 13:39.650
You can see or hear right.

13:39.680 --> 13:48.770
So going to see or hear border border top left radius and right right is 20 pixels.

13:49.210 --> 13:54.440
And let's copy this guy and let's just change it to right here.

13:54.470 --> 13:55.780
Right right.

13:56.730 --> 13:57.410
Right.

13:57.540 --> 14:00.190
And now both of them you can see match.

14:00.230 --> 14:04.020
Now once we done with this let's actually work with the form.

14:04.070 --> 14:11.910
So for the form we're going to say display flex and then we're going to say flex direction column for

14:12.030 --> 14:18.440
the election column we're here right now I can see that they're lining up one on top of each other padding

14:18.550 --> 14:22.850
is going to be 20 pixels or here like this all around.

14:22.850 --> 14:28.220
Then we're going to work with form input and form text area.

14:28.610 --> 14:40.910
So I'm going to say form input karma for one text area or here or here we're going to say margin 5 pixels

14:41.090 --> 14:43.280
0 and we're here.

14:43.430 --> 14:52.060
And let's add a few more properties and values by adding 5 pixels 0 or here.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.440
And just to make sure we get it right important.

14:56.120 --> 14:56.440
Right.

14:56.540 --> 14:58.860
Just to make sure that it actually works.

14:58.980 --> 15:03.270
And here we're going to say we're we're going to say none.

15:03.530 --> 15:05.880
So we're going to basically get it at the borders.

15:06.080 --> 15:16.120
Then once we have a border run we're going to see font size 20 pixels on this board or bottom.

15:16.110 --> 15:21.500
So now that we have our border is gone or here we're going to say three pixels solid.

15:21.740 --> 15:24.620
And let's use the blue color.

15:24.850 --> 15:32.420
So let's go up and let's actually see what is the mood Color know this copy and paste them back over

15:32.420 --> 15:33.570
here copy and paste.

15:33.570 --> 15:35.260
Now the borders are here right.

15:35.460 --> 15:40.440
So you can see we here now we have the borders then we're going to get rid of the background and so

15:40.590 --> 15:44.440
transparent like this.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.470
And now we're going to work with a placeholder right.

15:47.510 --> 15:56.780
So we're going to say like this or we're all going to say that this is going to be a form input here

15:56.930 --> 15:58.170
and placeholder.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.970
So basically the text that is inside our hair.

16:01.100 --> 16:01.540
Right.

16:01.730 --> 16:03.130
So what's going to be right.

16:03.350 --> 16:07.670
So first of all can they say text transfer.

16:08.010 --> 16:12.720
And we're going to take up twice more here than color.

16:12.950 --> 16:20.660
We're going to use a hash tag 8 8 8 8 8 8.

16:21.660 --> 16:30.240
So this is going to be the color then same thing we're going to do here with a text area right.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.660
So this is going to be the same thing was going to change around.

16:34.280 --> 16:41.580
Copy and paste and all right textarea text area right.

16:41.620 --> 16:47.910
And then after that we would want a form button on here.

16:47.970 --> 16:59.160
Font size is going to be twenty five pixels margin is going to be 10 pixels and 0 and we're here so

16:59.160 --> 17:06.540
10 top bottom zero on the sides background and on here I'm going to I'm going to copy and paste a light

17:06.570 --> 17:16.560
blue color border radius border radius and that's going to be 20 pixels on here.

17:16.560 --> 17:25.800
Now let's add a few more properties and values padding is going to be five pixels and 0.

17:26.120 --> 17:36.680
Here's the top bottom five on the right and left zero color hash tag f 5 3 5 here and then we'll going

17:36.690 --> 17:47.530
to do a transition here for transition we're going to say transition color 2 seconds he's right on background

17:47.540 --> 17:49.830
two seconds is my ground.

17:49.980 --> 17:53.140
Two seconds is when you're like this.

17:53.140 --> 17:59.380
Once we have this we're going to save one button no real hover.

17:59.980 --> 18:02.010
And as we were hovering what should happen.

18:02.380 --> 18:03.780
First of all going to change background.

18:03.780 --> 18:10.430
Hash tag 1 9 1 9 1 9 and then color right and the color is going to be light blue again.

18:10.690 --> 18:16.000
So basically like this right as I'm hovering You can see that the text is changing and the background

18:16.000 --> 18:16.870
is changing.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.190
And now let's make it responsive.

18:19.570 --> 18:26.700
So what I'm going to say I'm going to say that this is going to be media screen here media screen and

18:27.590 --> 18:37.960
we're men with red with we're here and this is going to be seven seven six pixels or here like this.

18:37.970 --> 18:45.850
So the moment it gets to 776 pixels we're going to say Contact Center.

18:46.550 --> 18:47.830
And what should happen.

18:48.120 --> 18:54.260
And we're going to say first the display flex then we're going to say padding like this.

18:54.260 --> 18:54.790
Right.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.840
So first let's look at how it would look like.

18:56.840 --> 18:57.310
Right.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.990
So called masters and we're going to go here right.

19:01.010 --> 19:04.260
So this is the look that we have right now.

19:04.250 --> 19:10.860
Then we're going to have a batting zero 40 pixels more like this.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.860
So that's going to be here on the sides.

19:15.020 --> 19:29.460
Then when I say contact info contact fall here we would want to flex 0 0 calc and so our guide function

19:29.460 --> 19:36.820
again 60 percent over here minus one I'm here.

19:36.930 --> 19:40.000
And let's copy and paste this and change the form.

19:40.050 --> 19:41.860
So copy and paste this.

19:42.030 --> 19:50.510
This is going to be form and out here this is going to be 40 percent 40 percent say read refresh.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.310
And now we can see what we have right.

19:52.490 --> 20:00.780
So the form is going to be to 60 percent Zari 40 percent and contact info is going to be 60 percent.

20:01.110 --> 20:03.160
And this is going to be it for this project.
