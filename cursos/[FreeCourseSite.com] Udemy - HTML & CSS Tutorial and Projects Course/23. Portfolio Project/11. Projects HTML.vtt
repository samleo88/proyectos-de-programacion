WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:04.690
The next section we're going to be making is going to be a project section.

00:04.710 --> 00:10.500
So here again we're going to have a town hall and then all these are going to be our project or here

00:10.500 --> 00:15.510
you can see that we're going to use the flex box actually for the long haul but we're also going to

00:15.510 --> 00:22.960
have a few other see assess effects that are actually going to have create an overlay on here we're

00:22.950 --> 00:26.110
going to have a massive icon here in the center.

00:26.160 --> 00:30.830
And as we were hovering You can see that the color is actually changing for the eye.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.930
So let's go ahead to the next stage.

00:34.110 --> 00:36.010
How was that working on this.

00:36.240 --> 00:42.300
So the first one is going to be again as always comments are going to say what projects are your section

00:42.780 --> 00:49.200
and the ones we have the opening comment and then also going to have the End of Project section.

00:49.230 --> 00:55.850
Now once we have the comments now we will need a section here with a class of project.

00:56.130 --> 00:59.310
So this is going to be our class project.

00:59.550 --> 01:04.620
And once we have a section ready to go now we would want a title.

01:04.620 --> 01:07.440
So here we're going to find where is a section.

01:07.590 --> 01:09.790
I know the closest one.

01:09.880 --> 01:15.740
And over here once we grab the section title let's go ahead and again let's copy and paste this over

01:15.740 --> 01:16.210
here.

01:16.560 --> 01:23.070
And let's just scroll all the way down to where we are working and just place it in our section.

01:23.280 --> 01:28.260
So here this is the project so we're going to copy and paste this on here and then we're going to go

01:28.260 --> 01:32.790
to the services and we're going to change the services and we're going to say that this is going to

01:32.790 --> 01:34.060
be project.

01:34.110 --> 01:35.970
So we're all going to say project.

01:36.240 --> 01:41.610
Once we save it if I scroll down on here you can see that I have my project title over here ready to

01:41.610 --> 01:44.100
go and I want to have my title.

01:44.280 --> 01:47.250
Now the next one is going to be creating the project.

01:47.250 --> 01:51.880
So here again we're going to start with the project here center.

01:52.110 --> 01:56.180
So we're going to have two underscores center then within the center.

01:56.190 --> 01:58.390
Now we want to create a single project.

01:58.500 --> 02:03.710
So we're going to say single project No we are going to copy and paste this line and how are you going

02:03.720 --> 02:10.540
to say and of a single project and once we have our first comments let's place the actual project.

02:10.660 --> 02:14.170
So for that let's create a article.

02:14.340 --> 02:20.670
So we're going to say we're here to go and for the article we would want a class and the class is going

02:20.670 --> 02:23.080
to be project to underscores.

02:23.130 --> 02:30.000
And I'm single project here so this is going to be our article now within an article we're all going

02:30.000 --> 02:35.490
to have is going to be the image we're here and for the image we're also going to have a class which

02:35.490 --> 02:38.460
is going to be projects we're here to underscore.

02:38.730 --> 02:42.680
And single project and here I am.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.370
So this is going to be our image.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.970
And once we have the image now we will need a source.

02:47.970 --> 02:52.890
So we're going to have an image and all or just saying this is going to be portfolio zero.

02:53.070 --> 02:54.550
And also for the alternative.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.090
All right.

02:55.090 --> 02:59.820
And this is going to be Portfolio portfolio like this.

02:59.820 --> 03:06.250
And once we actually have our image on next I would want a phantasm like.

03:06.510 --> 03:09.460
So that's going to be the icon that's actually hovering.

03:09.610 --> 03:14.130
So as we're hovering over here now I would want to place this icon so that we're going to do we're going

03:14.130 --> 03:19.830
to see where the image ends and we're going to have a link on here and we're going to say that this

03:19.830 --> 03:24.080
link is going to have a class of PROJECT PROJECT.

03:24.090 --> 03:25.520
We're here to honor scores.

03:25.740 --> 03:33.570
And we're going to have a single project and we're going to call this an icon like this.

03:33.630 --> 03:39.360
And within this Tref or here now what I would want is actually you can see that I'm going to place a

03:39.360 --> 03:45.650
hash tag and I'm going to go inside this link and we're actually going to create a fantastic America.

03:45.990 --> 03:52.820
So we're here we're going to say our f a s and we're going to have F.A. search on here.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.040
A press tab.

03:54.090 --> 03:55.200
We're going to save it.

03:55.350 --> 04:02.250
And if I go down on here you can see that I have the image and I have the font awesome like honestly

04:02.280 --> 04:05.400
the image is way too big on here.

04:05.400 --> 04:10.160
So what we would need to do is we're going to go to the actual C Ss and stylus.

04:10.320 --> 04:16.800
However before we do this I'm just going to grab the single project going to go down to the end of single

04:16.800 --> 04:21.060
project and I'm going to copy and paste this actually seven more times.

04:21.060 --> 04:25.320
One two three four five six seven here.

04:25.380 --> 04:31.750
Now I just need to change the numbers so you can see or hear that I have a portfolio on here.

04:31.930 --> 04:35.670
And for the portfolio I think I believe I have seven.

04:35.750 --> 04:37.090
I really like this.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.050
I'm going to scroll down all the way here.

04:39.120 --> 04:45.350
You can zoom in this is going to be my second here if I'm going to change this actually to 6.

04:45.460 --> 04:54.040
So portfolio 6 over here and we have again a portfolio of five and we're going to have an image again

04:54.270 --> 04:55.110
for.

04:55.110 --> 05:01.650
So basically the only thing we're doing we're just changing the numbers or so if it was portfolio for

05:02.100 --> 05:03.900
now this is going to be three.

05:03.900 --> 05:12.750
And then we have 2 1 3 and then we're going to have till the last minute is it going to be or you know

05:12.750 --> 05:19.470
one or more you know we're going to have one we're going to save this and let's stick it out of here.

05:19.500 --> 05:27.600
So so far we have our eight project now that we're done with HD and now we're ready to go to see assess

05:27.660 --> 05:29.620
and start styling this action.
