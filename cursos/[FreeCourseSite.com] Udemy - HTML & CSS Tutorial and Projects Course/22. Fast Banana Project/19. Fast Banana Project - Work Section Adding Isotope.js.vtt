WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:05.130
And let's go ahead and let's actually we can copy in the same code more here like this.

00:05.130 --> 00:05.770
Right.

00:05.790 --> 00:09.630
We had in our isotope file right because this is not going to change.

00:09.690 --> 00:13.740
We're still using a filter bottom group we're using to grow.

00:13.740 --> 00:15.130
So what I'm going to do here.

00:15.350 --> 00:21.870
We're going to copy and paste the script whatever we actually copy and pasted on here from the Web site.

00:21.970 --> 00:23.910
We're going to go back to indexation the amount.

00:24.180 --> 00:25.420
And we're going to see.

00:25.430 --> 00:29.550
And so now we have script GNAS and now this is going to be our rights.

00:29.790 --> 00:34.460
So what I'm going to say we're here and this is going to be script here press tab No.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.570
Here we're going to say that this is going to be isotope.

00:36.730 --> 00:41.850
So this is going to be source and we're going to say we're here this is going to be isotope.

00:41.980 --> 00:42.370
Right.

00:42.510 --> 00:48.460
So let's say Yes here's what I would want to do is we're going to create a new file.

00:48.520 --> 00:55.470
I say I so jealous know here we're going to do the same thing we're going to have any dollar sign document

00:56.340 --> 01:01.850
document and we're here and we're going to say that we would want a document ready.

01:02.070 --> 01:02.340
Right.

01:02.340 --> 01:06.080
And that's going to be the function function and Hanuman's function.

01:06.270 --> 01:09.860
Oh curly braces and we're here now what.

01:09.870 --> 01:14.640
When the document is actually ready what we would want to do right here I'm going to copy and paste

01:14.640 --> 01:19.000
the code and on here this we need to change the grid.

01:19.170 --> 01:22.960
We need to change here to here in this container.

01:23.220 --> 01:25.410
Picture containers like this.

01:25.410 --> 01:27.770
So I'm going to say so here.

01:28.020 --> 01:33.790
Picture a container come here or here.

01:33.990 --> 01:35.700
And then this one is going to stay the same.

01:35.700 --> 01:37.010
It's a filter group.

01:37.110 --> 01:40.450
And again depending on the value would want to filter it.

01:40.490 --> 01:45.540
So I'm going to save this one over here we can close the house set up and go back or read in exchange

01:45.560 --> 01:46.430
you know.

01:46.440 --> 01:46.740
All right.

01:46.740 --> 01:50.580
Make sure that we have the actual source is working right.

01:50.610 --> 01:56.370
So maybe let's go back over here and we're going to say this is going to be a comment right.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.420
So yes we're hearing this.

01:59.670 --> 02:00.890
So I would say this.

02:01.080 --> 02:07.200
And over here once we are going to go back to the actual page right recording and refresh and I can

02:07.200 --> 02:07.920
see what we have.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.680
Right now our isotope is working.

02:10.890 --> 02:14.210
And you can see how it's actually adjusting to the screen size.

02:14.280 --> 02:15.260
Or like this.

02:15.450 --> 02:21.750
And once we go back or here if we want the city we get the city we want the country to country for what

02:21.790 --> 02:25.190
water we get the water the more we get them back.

02:25.380 --> 02:29.050
Now there's one more thing that I to talk about with the ISO.

02:29.080 --> 02:29.680
Right.

02:29.790 --> 02:32.200
You're dealing with an images right.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.750
And what's happening with an image.

02:33.780 --> 02:36.890
I mean maybe we're going to be using filtering for something else.

02:36.900 --> 02:42.800
But in most cases you're going to be using these for images and images take a long time to download.

02:42.890 --> 02:43.140
All right.

02:43.140 --> 02:47.950
In some cases and what you don't want is actually images loading one by one.

02:47.980 --> 02:54.450
I can tell you one Actually I said start working only when the images have been downloaded completely.

02:54.450 --> 02:59.290
And if we go back to I set up and actually have a way of fixing it.

02:59.460 --> 03:02.360
So I'm there to lay out like this.

03:02.370 --> 03:05.490
If we scroll down right we have images loaded.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.030
Right.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.010
And first of all that's what they're saying.

03:08.010 --> 03:10.850
First you would need to have this kind of code right.

03:10.890 --> 03:16.090
And then you wouldn't need to download another CD and so I'm going to go back over here and once again

03:16.140 --> 03:18.670
to say that this is what we would want right.

03:18.690 --> 03:24.600
So I'm going to select this guy like this and we're just going to say copy and we're going to go back

03:24.600 --> 03:26.220
over here to our file.

03:26.220 --> 03:29.150
We're going to go to ISO right over here.

03:29.190 --> 03:32.040
We will need to find where this is ending.

03:32.050 --> 03:32.310
All right.

03:32.310 --> 03:39.270
So this is going to be a still this one for the filter button group where we're going to go underneath

03:39.270 --> 03:39.910
here.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.970
All right and see images loaded here.

03:44.220 --> 03:46.000
Just copy and paste this one right.

03:46.050 --> 03:48.440
So this is going to be another code right.

03:48.510 --> 03:51.210
It's still working with a grid.

03:51.570 --> 03:53.710
It's going to be still same very.

03:53.730 --> 03:54.330
Right.

03:54.340 --> 03:57.630
We're just making sure that everything works right.

03:57.810 --> 04:01.630
Just when images are loaded I'm going to say this one over here.

04:01.860 --> 04:06.390
And then what you need to do is we're going to go back and we're going to go back and we're going to

04:06.390 --> 04:10.340
see where these images loaded which is loaded with I'm going to click it over here.

04:10.530 --> 04:13.670
And again you can see really have a seat here.

04:13.680 --> 04:14.110
Right.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.950
So again we can have a modified right.

04:17.040 --> 04:22.530
So I was going to say we're here and this is what you should always do if you want to work with ISO

04:22.620 --> 04:24.260
in your projects right.

04:24.270 --> 04:28.670
Right before the actual isotope when want copy and paste the CD-ROM.

04:28.680 --> 04:35.720
Right and I'm going to give it a comment of images loaded right here.

04:35.730 --> 04:36.010
All right.

04:36.030 --> 04:39.190
We're going to copy and paste this one or your right hand over here.

04:39.190 --> 04:41.140
Now this is a fast connection right.

04:41.240 --> 04:45.360
So obviously we're not going to see this right now but in general this is what you should always do

04:45.360 --> 04:48.200
if somebody who is visiting your site.

04:48.350 --> 04:48.560
Right.

04:48.570 --> 04:52.350
If he has a slow connection then the isotope is actually going to start working.

04:52.350 --> 04:52.890
Right.

04:52.920 --> 04:57.060
Only when the images are loaded right then you can still see that everything works.

04:57.270 --> 05:03.870
And like I was saying in the beginning right if you want to explore the actual isotope right you are

05:03.870 --> 05:06.680
more of them more than welcomed over there.

05:06.710 --> 05:07.320
Right.

05:07.350 --> 05:12.390
And you can go to I said don't print and or here you can see that everything starts from the from the

05:12.390 --> 05:13.170
scratch.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.260
Now again we went over things right.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.330
Obviously we skipped some things right.

05:18.330 --> 05:21.390
We were not going line by line and everything right.

05:21.390 --> 05:25.420
But over there you can really go you know and explore everything right.

05:25.590 --> 05:29.670
Starting from the install then after that we have an actual set up.

05:29.670 --> 05:30.240
Right.

05:30.240 --> 05:34.270
So here you can see that getting started and pretty much they're telling you right.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.280
So you need isotope right for sure.

05:37.350 --> 05:44.220
Then you need or hear these days like this then or here we would need a seat assess.

05:44.320 --> 05:44.580
Right.

05:44.610 --> 05:49.630
If you want to do it just right and then obviously they're asking you to initialize with Jake Querrey

05:49.680 --> 05:50.960
or with javascript right.

05:51.150 --> 05:55.040
But again this is a whole another tutorial right.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.560
We just needed in our case right.

05:57.590 --> 06:01.280
Just it for a page so our page stands out.
