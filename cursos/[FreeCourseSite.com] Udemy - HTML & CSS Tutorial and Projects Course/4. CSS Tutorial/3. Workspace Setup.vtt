00:00.360 --> 00:04.430
Why don't we start very simply by saying up our workspace.

00:04.440 --> 00:07.040
So as you can see right now I'm sitting at my desktop.

00:07.260 --> 00:10.300
So I'm gonna create a new folder I'm gonna call this folder.

00:10.320 --> 00:15.140
Let's say I see SS but as always you can name your folders however you like.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.630
And then we're going to open up our text editor.

00:17.670 --> 00:22.890
Now I'm gonna open up the text there and again we know that there's multiple ways how we can get our

00:22.890 --> 00:27.980
files here but for now let's just grab the folder since that would be the fastest way.

00:28.050 --> 00:31.530
And right now I have my folder in my text there.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.620
So everything is working really nice.

00:33.720 --> 00:37.390
Now next I would like to create a new indexation in my file.

00:37.470 --> 00:41.780
I'm going to say new indexation amount which is gonna be our homepage and then you know what.

00:41.790 --> 00:43.410
Let me just make it bigger.

00:43.470 --> 00:49.200
But before we do that let's open up the new window for the browser window because again we would like

00:49.200 --> 00:55.790
to see the all the changes that we're creating in our texture live as they are happening in the browser.

00:55.800 --> 01:00.090
So for this we're going to say that there is going to be a browser window and let's set them side by

01:00.090 --> 01:01.400
side.

01:01.410 --> 01:06.150
Now you don't have to technically do it this way but I think it's just gonna be easier for you to.

01:06.330 --> 01:11.460
And then in the indexation amount let's just create a basic HDMI structure.

01:11.460 --> 01:17.220
Now again we're gonna be doing this using the Internet and maybe we can also change right away the document

01:17.220 --> 01:17.790
name.

01:17.950 --> 01:24.420
So the title on your web page and let's just call this your search tutorial and maybe let's write it

01:24.420 --> 01:31.920
like this is as tutorial hopefully this is going to be spelled correctly and we can add some maybe adding

01:31.920 --> 01:34.500
one with low world.

01:34.830 --> 01:37.860
So I'm gonna say this and this is gonna be my starting point.

01:38.040 --> 01:43.380
And then let's open up in the alive server and again we know that we have multiple options we can right

01:43.380 --> 01:50.670
click it and notice we have open life server or we can use the actual shortcut which would be again

01:50.670 --> 02:00.160
command plus L plus command Oh now has a C and a bottom minus server has been started at the port five

02:00.170 --> 02:05.120
thousand five hundred but sure enough it right away open up in the browser I know.

02:05.370 --> 02:10.710
Now I'm also would like to open this up in the bigger browser window just in case we would want to see

02:10.710 --> 02:13.280
some things shown in the bigger browser window.

02:13.620 --> 02:18.990
And for this I'm gonna open up the new window and here I'm gonna be looking again for one twenty seven

02:19.680 --> 02:21.150
point zero point one.

02:21.210 --> 02:27.110
And again port would be fifty five hundred and then it gives me a suggestion right away for indexation.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.310
And sure enough this is gonna be my webpage.

02:30.390 --> 02:32.190
So this would be our basic setup.

02:32.390 --> 02:35.260
And now let me just maybe make this a little bit smaller.

02:35.260 --> 02:43.260
The side window as well as the browser because again in most cases most of our work we're gonna do here

02:43.260 --> 02:46.770
in the centre because this is where we're gonna write our CSX.
