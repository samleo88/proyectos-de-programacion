00:00.150 --> 00:02.490
Absolute values were a piece of cake.

00:02.490 --> 00:06.210
Just type the value and see ISIS is gonna spit back in the browser.

00:06.210 --> 00:12.310
Whatever value we chose what about relative values and the first value we're gonna be looking at it

00:12.570 --> 00:15.890
is gonna be the percent of our not for us.

00:15.900 --> 00:17.190
I will go and delete.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.770
So we all gonna get rid of the heading one as well as we're going to head over back to a normal.

00:23.910 --> 00:28.650
And here I'm going to create a new div I'm gonna add some class I'm going to say that this would be

00:28.650 --> 00:29.390
the alternative.

00:29.760 --> 00:33.010
And within the order of let's add another day with the class of inner.

00:33.570 --> 00:35.900
So again the naming is really up to you.

00:36.030 --> 00:40.630
As long as you actually remember by the time you get to see ISIS so far so good.

00:40.630 --> 00:42.290
So we have our HCM holder.

00:42.660 --> 00:44.930
Now I'm gonna head over to the.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.990
And first I'm gonna start styling the inner.

00:48.420 --> 00:54.080
Now for the inner Dave I'm gonna say very simply that I would want with and I would want let's say within

00:54.090 --> 00:54.700
percentage.

00:55.290 --> 01:00.030
So let's start very easy we're gonna say 50 percent so far so good.

01:00.030 --> 01:01.970
After that we would like to look at the height.

01:02.040 --> 01:02.870
So I'm gonna say height.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.010
And again we can do the same thing.

01:05.010 --> 01:07.020
The height is gonna be 50 percent.

01:07.020 --> 01:10.950
Now also in order to see what's happening maybe add some background color.

01:11.520 --> 01:15.840
So would say there's going to be a better color and we're just gonna go with the right one.

01:15.960 --> 01:18.200
Now once I save it nothing happened.

01:19.670 --> 01:24.290
I mean you can jump back to a shooting and now you can probably double check maybe your classes were

01:24.290 --> 01:25.130
not matching.

01:25.130 --> 01:31.910
Maybe I don't know you didn't have enough coffee today but it's not working so either we can yell out

01:31.910 --> 01:38.170
some nasty things towards the screen or we can figure out what is happening where the percentage is.

01:38.300 --> 01:44.520
You see the percentages are gonna depend on the parent element not what is in our case parent element.

01:44.600 --> 01:50.980
We have the inner right and then we have the outer so I would assume that the outer is going to be the

01:50.980 --> 01:54.790
parent and then the inner is going to be the child.

01:54.790 --> 02:00.530
Now let me pick this a little bit and we'll going to ask for the outer also some width and height.

02:01.060 --> 02:02.550
So here I'm going to say for the outer.

02:02.550 --> 02:05.300
Dave I'm gonna be looking for what.

02:05.350 --> 02:09.550
Well first I would like to have somewhere well let's say again we're going to go back to the pixels

02:10.060 --> 02:15.700
and we're gonna say that the West is gonna be fine and pixels and also the height is as well going to

02:15.700 --> 02:16.990
be 500 pixels.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.590
So far so good.

02:18.700 --> 02:25.210
And let's add maybe also a background color and the background is gonna be a little let's say this.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.740
And what do we see.

02:26.810 --> 02:33.530
So we have the outer div that should have the 500 and 500 and then the inner one is gonna be exactly

02:33.530 --> 02:39.770
the half because obviously we went with 50 percent as well as the 50 percent for height.

02:40.460 --> 02:44.790
So now I can see that this is the relative and this is relative to the parent.

02:44.810 --> 02:50.300
So if I'm gonna make this two hundred just so we can understand a little bit easier we should and we

02:50.300 --> 02:54.170
should see that the inner Dave should be hundred by hundred.

02:54.170 --> 02:56.720
Now it is still going to be displayed in the percentages.

02:56.990 --> 03:02.140
However the moment we're gonna be changing these values the two hundred or two hundred.

03:02.180 --> 03:05.360
Also the width of the inner one is also gonna change.

03:05.510 --> 03:08.690
Now we can also change it by just changing the percentages.

03:08.900 --> 03:11.540
We're not limited to 50 percent by any means.

03:11.540 --> 03:15.980
So if I'm going to say the West is gonna be hundred percent now my waist is gonna be hundred percent

03:16.070 --> 03:17.660
of this two hundred pixels.

03:17.780 --> 03:21.080
You want more you go girl can do 400.

03:21.110 --> 03:26.070
Now we have the outer one or 400 and again it follows the same principle.

03:26.120 --> 03:31.050
The only thing we need to remember that percentage is we all going to depend on a parent element.
