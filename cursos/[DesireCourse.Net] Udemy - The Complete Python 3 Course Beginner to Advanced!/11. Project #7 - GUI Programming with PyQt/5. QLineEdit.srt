1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,380
Alright guys, so I'm going to actually

2

00:00:01,380  -->  00:00:03,899
remove everything from the init_ui

3

00:00:03,899  -->  00:00:08,490
method right now except for setWindowTitle

4

00:00:08,490  -->  00:00:12,059
and the show method, because what

5

00:00:12,059  -->  00:00:13,349
we're going to be doing now is we're just

6

00:00:13,349  -->  00:00:15,509
going to create a very simple graphical

7

00:00:15,509  -->  00:00:19,560
application using horizontal and vbox

8

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:22,590
layouts. And so we are going to create a

9

00:00:22,590  -->  00:00:24,930
button here first, so button is going to

10

00:00:24,930  -->  00:00:32,130
equal to QPushButton, and it's going to

11

00:00:32,130  -->  00:00:36,960
say "Set Name" And this is going to be

12

00:00:36,960  -->  00:00:39,090
added to the bottom row, so we're

13

00:00:39,090  -->  00:00:41,670
gonna set that there for now, and

14

00:00:41,670  -->  00:00:43,829
above the button instantiation here

15

00:00:43,829  -->  00:00:48,059
we're going to create both a label and a

16

00:00:48,059  -->  00:00:51,360
QLineEdit which is basically a

17

00:00:51,360  -->  00:00:53,820
text input, that's what it's called here

18

00:00:53,820  -->  00:00:55,890
in qt. So, let's go ahead and create a

19

00:00:55,890  -->  00:00:59,100
label and it's going to be equal to

20

00:00:59,100  -->  00:01:10,740
QLabel("Name: "), and then label let's name

21

00:01:10,740  -->  00:01:13,770
it name_input. It's going to be equal to

22

00:01:13,770  -->  00:01:18,810
QLineEdit, and this doesn't take in any

23

00:01:18,810  -->  00:01:21,869
parameters. So, what we need to do now

24

00:01:21,869  -->  00:01:23,100
once we've got these three things

25

00:01:23,100  -->  00:01:25,920
created, i'm going to drop down a few lines, we're

26

00:01:25,920  -->  00:01:28,229
going to create our horizontal layout

27

00:01:28,229  -->  00:01:31,110
first. So we're just going to name it h

28

00:01:31,110  -->  00:01:34,290
just for simplicity here, and we're gonna say

29

00:01:34,290  -->  00:01:41,310
QHBoxLayout. We're going to add stretch

30

00:01:41,310  -->  00:01:47,790
to that so h.addStretch, and then we're going

31

00:01:47,790  -->  00:01:49,920
to start adding our two widgets to the

32

00:01:49,920  -->  00:01:53,070
first line. So, in this instance it's

33

00:01:53,070  -->  00:01:57,840
going to go like this h.addWidget(label),

34

00:01:57,840  -->  00:02:02,770
and then

35

00:02:02,770  -->  00:02:09,250
h.addWidget(name_input). Now we're going to

36

00:02:09,250  -->  00:02:12,310
create a vertical box layout and we're

37

00:02:12,310  -->  00:02:16,300
going to add the button down under the

38

00:02:16,300  -->  00:02:19,209
horizontal line there. So, let's just type

39

00:02:19,209  -->  00:02:23,709
v for vertical, and we're going to create

40

00:02:23,709  -->  00:02:32,019
QVBoxLayout, going to say v.addStretch, and

41

00:02:32,019  -->  00:02:35,769
then we're going to add the layout so

42

00:02:35,769  -->  00:02:42,430
v.addLayout and we're going to say h, and

43

00:02:42,430  -->  00:02:44,620
then we're going to add our button. So

44

00:02:44,620  -->  00:02:49,329
v.addWidget and we're going to add button

45

00:02:49,329  -->  00:02:51,970
here. Now what we're going to do we've

46

00:02:51,970  -->  00:02:55,060
got everything set except we need to

47

00:02:55,060  -->  00:02:57,400
tell the main window that we're going to

48

00:02:57,400  -->  00:02:59,680
be using the vertical layout as the top

49

00:02:59,680  -->  00:03:07,060
level. So, self.setLayout and then we set it to v. Now

50

00:03:07,060  -->  00:03:08,620
we're going to save this and run the

51

00:03:08,620  -->  00:03:12,609
application and we see that we have a

52

00:03:12,609  -->  00:03:14,739
name input here, and what I'm going to

53

00:03:14,739  -->  00:03:17,230
do is I'm going to remove that

54

00:03:17,230  -->  00:03:23,380
add.Stretch and rerun this application, and

55

00:03:23,380  -->  00:03:26,950
now you'll see that it actually does

56

00:03:26,950  -->  00:03:31,209
stretch now. So, I'm going to remove the

57

00:03:31,209  -->  00:03:37,530
stretch from vertical as well.

58

00:03:41,340  -->  00:03:44,730
So, we've got a name input and we can

59

00:03:44,730  -->  00:03:48,000
actually type in here but it doesn't do

60

00:03:48,000  -->  00:03:51,569
anything. So, what we're going to do in

61

00:03:51,569  -->  00:03:52,800
the next video we're actually going to

62

00:03:52,800  -->  00:03:56,310
talk about event handling within

63

00:03:56,310  -->  00:03:59,069
Python here. So we did a bit of qml

64

00:03:59,069  -->  00:04:01,470
event handling and we're going to learn

65

00:04:01,470  -->  00:04:05,390
how to do the same thing in Python.
