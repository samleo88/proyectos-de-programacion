No one in the world is a CML measured the amount stands for hyper taxed markup language.

00:07.830 --> 00:14.360
And what this mumbo jumbo gibberish means is that each the amount is not a programming language.

00:14.490 --> 00:17.180
It is in fact a mark of language.

00:17.190 --> 00:22.410
Now why HD email is so important and well worth our time learning.

00:22.830 --> 00:29.610
You see the email is responsible for the structure of the web pages and that makes HDMI elements the

00:29.640 --> 00:36.940
building blocks of the web pages and similar elements are represented by this syntax content between

00:36.940 --> 00:38.160
the tags.

00:38.160 --> 00:43.770
More precisely opening tag which consists of the name of the element we would like to use.

00:43.920 --> 00:50.730
Surrounded by angle brackets following what will be displayed on the web page and then the closing tag

00:50.760 --> 00:52.800
for the element for the closing tag.

00:52.800 --> 00:56.620
We also need to add forward slash before the name of the element.

00:57.480 --> 01:04.110
So if we want a hearing in our web page on what project we would create a hearing tag and write our

01:04.110 --> 01:10.620
heading if we would want the paragraph we would create a paragraph tag and some text that will be in

01:10.620 --> 01:11.820
our program.

01:11.820 --> 01:15.320
Same would go for the link and you get an idea.

01:15.360 --> 01:22.170
Some elements though will not have a closing tag like for example image or the line break and there

01:22.170 --> 01:28.260
will be times when you'll see for these elements with a forward slash before a closing angle bracket

01:29.170 --> 01:35.370
mileage the email 5 does not require that meaning both syntax is there valid with and without a forward

01:35.370 --> 01:41.940
slash for example react which is probably most popular javascript framework around today has a stricter

01:41.940 --> 01:49.200
policy more forward slash is required just something to remember just to give you an early taste of

01:49.350 --> 01:55.080
the email let me open up a new browser window and let's say that we're going to be searching for ESPN

01:55.080 --> 02:02.670
that call not once we open up the URL obviously we have our webpage however we can do the inspect look

02:02.670 --> 02:07.920
at developer tools and obviously we're going to cover this during the course and as you notice here

02:08.340 --> 02:12.270
even though there's a lot of moving parts because this is a complex page.

02:12.390 --> 02:14.810
Check this out you have all over the place.

02:14.820 --> 02:21.420
The opening tag and the closing tag meaning HCM is still responsible for the structure of this webpage

02:21.870 --> 02:23.820
and this is why it's so important to learn.

02:23.880 --> 02:24.300
The email.
