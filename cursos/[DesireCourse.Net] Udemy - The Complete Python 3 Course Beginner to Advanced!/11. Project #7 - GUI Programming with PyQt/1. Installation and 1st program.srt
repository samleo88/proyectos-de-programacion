00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,899
Hey guys, welcome back. So in this section

2

00:00:03,899  -->  00:00:05,549
what we're going to be covering are

3

00:00:05,549  -->  00:00:08,610
different tools and utilities, I guess

4

00:00:08,610  -->  00:00:11,010
libraries, to make graphical applications.

5

00:00:11,010  -->  00:00:14,009
And so that's why it's gonna be really

6

00:00:14,009  -->  00:00:16,529
fun because it's cool to make command

7

00:00:16,529  -->  00:00:19,140
line programs, but what's really

8

00:00:19,140  -->  00:00:21,300
awesome is to make programs that anybody

9

00:00:21,300  -->  00:00:23,519
can use without having to feel

10

00:00:23,519  -->  00:00:26,279
comfortable in terminal. So the first

11

00:00:26,279  -->  00:00:29,220
package that we're going to cover is

12

00:00:29,220  -->  00:00:32,820
PyQt5 and so you actually need to

13

00:00:32,820  -->  00:00:38,070
have Qt installed in order

14

00:00:38,070  -->  00:00:41,100
to have this work.

15

00:00:41,100  -->  00:00:43,770
So, what we need to do is we need to

16

00:00:43,770  -->  00:00:51,690
first go to qt5 so www.qt.io, it's

17

00:00:51,690  -->  00:00:54,899
pronounced cute, go to the downloads

18

00:00:54,899  -->  00:00:57,780
section here, and I mean you can also

19

00:00:57,780  -->  00:00:59,699
install it via brew, so if you want to

20

00:00:59,699  -->  00:01:01,890
go ahead and brew I'm just going to

21

00:01:01,890  -->  00:01:06,060
search brew search qt5 it

22

00:01:06,060  -->  00:01:07,530
should return a bunch of packages and

23

00:01:07,530  -->  00:01:10,020
you can build it from brew or you can

24

00:01:10,020  -->  00:01:15,060
install from this right here.

25

00:01:15,060  -->  00:01:17,369
So what you need to do you can either

26

00:01:17,369  -->  00:01:19,979
use a commercial if you want to pay for

27

00:01:19,979  -->  00:01:20,970
a license

28

00:01:20,970  -->  00:01:21,990
we're just going to go ahead with

29

00:01:21,990  -->  00:01:23,909
open-source. Are you prepared to make

30

00:01:23,909  -->  00:01:26,759
your application publicly available, yes,

31

00:01:26,759  -->  00:01:30,990
and we're going to comply with the LGPL

32

00:01:30,990  -->  00:01:33,930
license, yes, then you can click the get

33

00:01:33,930  -->  00:01:36,030
started button. You can go ahead and

34

00:01:36,030  -->  00:01:37,950
choose a download link for your system.

35

00:01:37,950  -->  00:01:41,369
If you want to view all downloads you can

36

00:01:41,369  -->  00:01:43,020
do that. You can either use an online

37

00:01:43,020  -->  00:01:45,869
installer or offline installer. Now the

38

00:01:45,869  -->  00:01:47,460
difference between the two is an online

39

00:01:47,460  -->  00:01:49,409
installer works like the chrome

40

00:01:49,409  -->  00:01:51,060
installer works. The initial download is

41

00:01:51,060  -->  00:01:53,310
really small as you can see 11 megabytes

42

00:01:53,310  -->  00:01:56,159
here, and once you launch that then

43

00:01:56,159  -->  00:01:58,530
that installer goes to the internet and

44

00:01:58,530  -->  00:02:01,110
downloads a whole bunch of necessary

45

00:02:01,110  -->  00:02:03,329
packages, I think it's around a

46

00:02:03,329  -->  00:02:06,750
gigabyte of a download it may be about 700

47

00:02:06,750  -->  00:02:10,619
megabytes, 800, something like that. So you're going

48

00:02:10,619  -->  00:02:13,170
to download that and install it. Now the

49

00:02:13,170  -->  00:02:13,680
easiest

50

00:02:13,680  -->  00:02:15,090
way to do that would be to compile

51

00:02:15,090  -->  00:02:17,640
from brew so just run brew install

52

00:02:17,640  -->  00:02:22,769
qt5. Now once you've done that you

53

00:02:22,769  -->  00:02:25,769
need to install two packages from pip. So

54

00:02:25,769  -->  00:02:29,280
go ahead and run pip3 install sip and

55

00:02:29,280  -->  00:02:34,859
pyqt5. I've already got these two

56

00:02:34,859  -->  00:02:36,810
installed you're gonna need both, so

57

00:02:36,810  -->  00:02:39,030
sip and pyqt5. This is gonna be

58

00:02:39,030  -->  00:02:40,500
the package were working with but this

59

00:02:40,500  -->  00:02:42,209
won't work without this so that's why we

60

00:02:42,209  -->  00:02:44,730
need to install that. So, once you've got

61

00:02:44,730  -->  00:02:48,480
qt5 installed, pyqt5, and sip

62

00:02:48,480  -->  00:02:51,239
we're now ready to actually get programming,

63

00:02:51,239  -->  00:02:52,889
and the installation is probably going

64

00:02:52,889  -->  00:02:54,239
to take a bit of time so feel free to

65

00:02:54,239  -->  00:02:56,040
pause this video here and come back when

66

00:02:56,040  -->  00:03:02,760
you've got all this set up. Now what I

67

00:03:02,760  -->  00:03:04,620
I'm going to do is I'm going to open up

68

00:03:04,620  -->  00:03:07,469
pycharm here, and we're going to write a

69

00:03:07,469  -->  00:03:10,049
really simple program, and then we're

70

00:03:10,049  -->  00:03:12,510
going to go over some documentation in

71

00:03:12,510  -->  00:03:13,799
the next few videos, and then we're going

72

00:03:13,799  -->  00:03:15,900
to get really deep into it. I'm going to go

73

00:03:15,900  -->  00:03:17,699
ahead and create a new project, going to

74

00:03:17,699  -->  00:03:22,319
call it qt5test, and we're

75

00:03:22,319  -->  00:03:24,329
going to use the default py3

76

00:03:24,329  -->  00:03:30,090
interpreter here, and I'm going to go

77

00:03:30,090  -->  00:03:32,189
ahead and create a Python file called

78

00:03:32,189  -->  00:03:34,620
main as we normally do.

79

00:03:34,620  -->  00:03:37,169
Now the first thing we're going to do is create

80

00:03:37,169  -->  00:03:42,720
crunchbang here, usr/bin/python3.

81

00:03:42,720  -->  00:03:46,229
This should be done in every program, I

82

00:03:46,229  -->  00:03:48,449
don't think we've done it yet, but you're

83

00:03:48,449  -->  00:03:49,949
going to want to. Then we're going to

84

00:03:49,949  -->  00:03:51,900
start importing packages. So the way we

85

00:03:51,900  -->  00:03:54,329
do this is pyqt5 has multiple

86

00:03:54,329  -->  00:03:56,340
classes that have classes within them,

87

00:03:56,340  -->  00:03:58,889
and so what we need to do is go

88

00:03:58,889  -->  00:04:06,030
from PyQt5.QtCore import *

89

00:04:06,030  -->  00:04:08,250
and we're just going to import

90

00:04:08,250  -->  00:04:10,500
everything for now, and the same thing

91

00:04:10,500  -->  00:04:15,030
for widgets. So, from PyQt5.QtWidgets

92

00:04:15,030  -->  00:04:22,420
import * everything.

93

00:04:22,420  -->  00:04:25,270
So the first thing we're gonna do is

94

00:04:25,270  -->  00:04:27,760
we're going to create a class that is

95

00:04:27,760  -->  00:04:31,960
going to have our basic page in there,

96

00:04:31,960  -->  00:04:33,640
it's gonna be really stupidly simple

97

00:04:33,640  -->  00:04:35,560
right now, so let's go ahead and create a

98

00:04:35,560  -->  00:04:40,600
class called Page, and it's going to

99

00:04:40,600  -->  00:04:46,000
inherit from (QWidget): We need that

100

00:04:46,000  -->  00:04:48,910
inheritance there. So now we're going to

101

00:04:48,910  -->  00:04:51,340
define an initialization function where

102

00:04:51,340  -->  00:04:55,930
we actually build out the page itself.

103

00:04:55,930  -->  00:05:00,160
So go ahead and def __init__(self):

104

00:05:00,160  -->  00:05:05,470
So, in order to instantiate this we

105

00:05:05,470  -->  00:05:07,900
need to do something a bit

106

00:05:07,900  -->  00:05:08,830
different and

107

00:05:08,830  -->  00:05:10,930
we need to instantiate the parent as

108

00:05:10,930  -->  00:05:14,440
well. So how we do that is super, we're

109

00:05:14,440  -->  00:05:17,380
going to instantiate the Page class that

110

00:05:17,380  -->  00:05:21,580
we just created, pass it self, and then

111

00:05:21,580  -->  00:05:26,170
we're going to add .__init__ and then

112

00:05:26,170  -->  00:05:28,510
we're going to instantiate the (parent).

113

00:05:28,510  -->  00:05:36,910
Unresolved reference to parent, alright.

114

00:05:36,910  -->  00:05:40,060
In init I actually need to pass

115

00:05:40,060  -->  00:05:42,130
parent=None just that it's set by default and

116

00:05:42,130  -->  00:05:45,280
it's going to be set afterwards. So, what

117

00:05:45,280  -->  00:05:46,390
we're going to do we're just going to

118

00:05:46,390  -->  00:05:51,970
create a label, so let's make

119

00:05:51,970  -->  00:05:56,110
this peppy, my_label = QLabel, and

120

00:05:56,110  -->  00:05:57,790
then it's really simple in here you just

121

00:05:57,790  -->  00:06:00,640
put whatever text you want to be there

122

00:06:00,640  -->  00:06:06,820
so ("This is my label") And then what we're going

123

00:06:06,820  -->  00:06:10,960
to do is we're going to create a

124

00:06:10,960  -->  00:06:14,050
layout kind of button. So we're going to

125

00:06:14,050  -->  00:06:20,500
create a widget called

126

00:06:20,500  -->  00:06:23,320
qvbox layout. So I'm going to name this

127

00:06:23,320  -->  00:06:27,940
layout = to QVBoxLayout

128

00:06:27,940  -->  00:06:33,220
just like that, and you don't

129

00:06:33,220  -->  00:06:34,180
need to

130

00:06:34,180  -->  00:06:36,009
pass anything to that to instantiate it.

131

00:06:36,009  -->  00:06:38,919
What we're going to do at this point is

132

00:06:38,919  -->  00:06:43,840
we're going to add the my label into the

133

00:06:43,840  -->  00:06:47,020
layout. So how we do that is you type out

134

00:06:47,020  -->  00:06:48,729
the name of the layout, so in this case

135

00:06:48,729  -->  00:06:52,479
it's layout.addWidget, and we're

136

00:06:52,479  -->  00:07:01,330
going to add (my_label). What we're going

137

00:07:01,330  -->  00:07:05,380
to do at this point we're going to...

138

00:07:05,380  -->  00:07:10,240
that's it for now, let's just go ahead

139

00:07:10,240  -->  00:07:14,470
and do this. Let's create a grid layout in

140

00:07:14,470  -->  00:07:17,740
here, so we're going to create a

141

00:07:17,740  -->  00:07:24,669
mainLayout = QGridLayout( ), and then

142

00:07:24,669  -->  00:07:27,220
we're going to put our layout into the

143

00:07:27,220  -->  00:07:30,160
main layout, I should have named these a bit

144

00:07:30,160  -->  00:07:39,639
differently. So, mainLayout.addLayout and

145

00:07:39,639  -->  00:07:43,090
we're going to add a (layout) in here. And

146

00:07:43,090  -->  00:07:46,300
then here need to put since it's a grid

147

00:07:46,300  -->  00:07:48,940
need to choose how many rows and columns

148

00:07:48,940  -->  00:07:54,190
you need. Alright, now we're going to

149

00:07:54,190  -->  00:08:02,080
set the layout, so self.setLayout it's going to be

150

00:08:02,080  -->  00:08:05,530
(mainLayout). And then we're going to set

151

00:08:05,530  -->  00:08:06,880
the title of the window so this is

152

00:08:06,880  -->  00:08:08,530
what's going to appear up in the title bar

153

00:08:08,530  -->  00:08:17,560
right there. So self.setWindowTitle and

154

00:08:17,560  -->  00:08:23,050
we're going to name it ("My First Qt App")

155

00:08:23,050  -->  00:08:27,729
I hope this has made sense so far. Then down here

156

00:08:27,729  -->  00:08:30,669
we're actually going to instantiate the

157

00:08:30,669  -->  00:08:33,700
application itself, so go ahead and write if

158

00:08:33,700  -->  00:08:41,110
__name__ == "__main__": we always need this

159

00:08:41,110  -->  00:08:44,169
when we're creating a package,

160

00:08:44,169  -->  00:08:46,720
especially in qt5 this is how we're going

161

00:08:46,720  -->  00:08:49,029
to be doing it through the entire thing.

162

00:08:49,029  -->  00:08:54,070
Let's go ahead and import sys, this is

163

00:08:54,070  -->  00:08:56,560
what we're going to need to be able to

164

00:08:56,560  -->  00:08:59,019
exit the app. Let's go ahead and let's

165

00:08:59,019  -->  00:09:02,110
assign a variable here called app, it's

166

00:09:02,110  -->  00:09:06,430
going to be equal to QApplication, going

167

00:09:06,430  -->  00:09:10,149
to pass in (sys.argv). This is going to be system

168

00:09:10,149  -->  00:09:12,610
arguments, in this case they're going to

169

00:09:12,610  -->  00:09:15,519
be none. So let's create the window

170

00:09:15,519  -->  00:09:19,690
itself. So window equals our class there,

171

00:09:19,690  -->  00:09:23,949
it's going to be Page, and then we're going to show

172

00:09:23,949  -->  00:09:27,040
our window. So if we don't run this the

173

00:09:27,040  -->  00:09:28,899
windows just going to be blank it's

174

00:09:28,899  -->  00:09:31,180
never going to show it. Then we need to

175

00:09:31,180  -->  00:09:34,810
call an exec function which is going to

176

00:09:34,810  -->  00:09:37,510
execute the window itself, not in a bad

177

00:09:37,510  -->  00:09:38,800
way in a good way, it's going to make it

178

00:09:38,800  -->  00:09:41,769
you know instantiate, so we're going to

179

00:09:41,769  -->  00:09:46,449
put that in to a sys.exit call, and

180

00:09:46,449  -->  00:09:48,490
we're going to exec just like that.

181

00:09:48,490  -->  00:09:52,390
We're going to save this, and we're going

182

00:09:52,390  -->  00:09:59,440
to run the file, and we should see this right

183

00:09:59,440  -->  00:10:03,459
here. This is our first qt app. As you

184

00:10:03,459  -->  00:10:05,769
can see it has full capabilities of any

185

00:10:05,769  -->  00:10:07,449
other application, it looks really stupid

186

00:10:07,449  -->  00:10:10,959
right now, but that's what we've

187

00:10:10,959  -->  00:10:13,329
done. We've actually created a graphical

188

00:10:13,329  -->  00:10:16,870
user interface using python and we're

189

00:10:16,870  -->  00:10:19,959
going to extend this a lot farther. So, I

190

00:10:19,959  -->  00:10:21,640
hope you guys got everything set up

191

00:10:21,640  -->  00:10:23,949
correctly, I hope I've explained this well,

192

00:10:23,949  -->  00:10:25,480
we're going to go over documentation to

193

00:10:25,480  -->  00:10:27,670
see all the different kinds of widgets

194

00:10:27,670  -->  00:10:30,550
and elements that we could use

195

00:10:30,550  -->  00:10:32,260
within qt5, and we're going to be

196

00:10:32,260  -->  00:10:35,019
using a lot of them coming up in the

197

00:10:35,019  -->  00:10:40,470
next few videos.
