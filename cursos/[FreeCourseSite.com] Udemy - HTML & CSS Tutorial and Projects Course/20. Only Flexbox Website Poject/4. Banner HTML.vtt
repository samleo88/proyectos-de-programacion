00:00.180 --> 00:07.530
So now that we are sitting in our next hour or here and you can see that all the additional thing from

00:07.650 --> 00:15.480
a basic set up you can see or hear that I have images for where I have placed my images and now actually

00:15.480 --> 00:17.190
we're ready to start working.

00:17.280 --> 00:21.650
And the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to start creating HD now.

00:21.910 --> 00:26.790
So we're here for the first one we're going to say that this is going to be better all year ahead with

00:26.880 --> 00:32.040
a CD or here of her some great i Petar and using hemat.

00:32.040 --> 00:37.110
I'm just going to place a hash tag over here and we're going to say ahead and I can see once I press

00:37.110 --> 00:42.510
the tag I have a header with an idea of header and within the header of the first thing that are going

00:42.510 --> 00:43.370
to create is going to be.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.590
Now I have someone to say oh here now.

00:45.810 --> 00:47.030
And we'll going to right away.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.760
Copy and paste online.

00:48.870 --> 00:52.540
So here I'm going to say I'm going to select this line and I'm going to say.

00:52.600 --> 00:59.330
And now then the next thing that I want to do is actually start placing the note here I'm going to create

00:59.340 --> 01:01.150
this is going to be in half tags.

01:01.270 --> 01:06.520
And within the now I'm actually going to have an ID an ID.

01:06.520 --> 01:13.610
Now I've got something to say div here and this is going to be handy and that is going to be Nav. on

01:13.630 --> 01:14.240
here.

01:14.630 --> 01:19.700
And with a price tag and here this is going to be the first thing is going to be adding three.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.200
So I'm going to say heading right.

01:21.480 --> 01:27.230
And we're going to type all here that is going to say coding or so coding on here.

01:27.240 --> 01:31.580
And then again you can see that we have had three with a calling.

01:31.710 --> 01:38.010
After that within There's Dave still within this top up we're going to create a another div and this

01:38.010 --> 01:39.500
is going to be for hamburger.

01:39.530 --> 01:48.050
But some of them say we're here and this is going to be div with an ID like this on the same menu between

01:48.170 --> 01:53.310
or here and we press that we can see that it creates a div with an ID of menu.

01:53.310 --> 01:57.170
But then after that we're going to have three divs with class.

01:57.240 --> 02:01.560
So I'm going to say we're here and this is going to be div with the class and I'm going to say bar one

02:01.740 --> 02:04.400
more here then press time.

02:04.420 --> 02:05.880
Now I have my first day.

02:06.120 --> 02:10.500
Then again I'm going to select the line and was going to copy and paste this.

02:10.530 --> 02:13.820
So here we're going to say this is going to be bar number two.

02:14.070 --> 02:16.440
And this is going to be bar number three.

02:16.890 --> 02:24.010
So now that we have ideas of top here then next thing you can actually work on links.

02:24.060 --> 02:29.620
So we're really going to place a common through we're going to say links here.

02:29.730 --> 02:36.320
And then within an hour of links we're going to have an ordered list here with an idea of links.

02:36.510 --> 02:36.790
Right.

02:36.820 --> 02:42.960
Going to we're going to play Stamm over here over here which we're going to have is a list item here

02:43.320 --> 02:47.890
and within the list item we're going to have a link here.

02:47.970 --> 02:53.520
And once we press the time you can see that it creates a link on the first link here is going to be

02:53.520 --> 02:54.330
home.

02:54.420 --> 02:59.580
And then again we're going to select a line we're here and then we're just going to copy and paste this

02:59.910 --> 03:03.940
and we're going to copy and paste this let's say over here four times.

03:03.940 --> 03:06.400
So now we have a four of them.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.750
All right so let's go one more here.

03:08.760 --> 03:13.530
Now we have five and the last one is actually going to have a font or something here.

03:13.530 --> 03:19.080
So what I'm going to do here again we're going to have a let's say we're going to go back here.

03:19.140 --> 03:22.890
Select the whole line copy and paste this over here.

03:22.890 --> 03:25.160
Not only this is going to be link.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.940
We're here with A-Class.

03:28.050 --> 03:31.890
It's all going to say class over here and we're going to see a link.

03:32.100 --> 03:38.300
I can I come over here and over here we're going to place actually a phantasm.

03:38.410 --> 03:46.080
So I'm going to say over here I was going to be not far and here I'm going to say for search and this

03:46.440 --> 03:50.410
press tab I mean you can see now I have a search on over here right.

03:50.470 --> 03:52.900
And this is all sitting within the leg.

03:53.040 --> 03:56.260
Then after that one Ousley change these ones around.

03:56.280 --> 04:00.520
So here we're going to just grab all lines or like this.

04:00.510 --> 04:02.230
And so we're going to select them all.

04:02.230 --> 04:04.740
Then delete them or we're going to write.

04:04.740 --> 04:11.180
And this is going to be skills than the next one is going to be portfolio.

04:11.550 --> 04:18.470
And then after I've done this guy's going to be a blog and over here this is going to be contact us.

04:18.670 --> 04:21.560
So contact us or here.

04:21.840 --> 04:26.560
And then even though we right away now going to style this section or right.

04:26.790 --> 04:31.350
But because it is still within the header we're actually going to work on banner.

04:31.620 --> 04:39.750
So I'm going to say we're here and this is going to be a section with an be your banner then or here

04:39.750 --> 04:43.440
we're going to have a div with a banner box.

04:43.500 --> 04:51.600
So I'm going to say all here and this is going to be the banner my inbox press tab over here and within

04:51.600 --> 04:54.480
the banner remarks we're going to have a heading one.

04:54.710 --> 05:03.660
We're having one again with an ID of banner title banner it all then we're going to have a coding attic

05:03.690 --> 05:08.550
inside so I'm going to write coding here.

05:08.850 --> 05:12.720
Then we're all going to have a div with the class banner on the line.

05:12.720 --> 05:17.400
So again this is going to be banner class right there line.

05:17.610 --> 05:23.340
So that's going to be the name on the class we're going to press tab and then we're going to have a

05:23.340 --> 05:28.390
having three like this and that's going to be banner subtitle.

05:28.410 --> 05:37.050
So the class of banner subtitle subtitle here and what we're going to write inside was saying this is

05:37.050 --> 05:50.700
going to be coding it here meets and we're going to say the the power off see SS flex box warrior.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.970
And then after that we're going to have a link.

05:53.280 --> 05:58.580
So right underneath a heading three when you say this is going to be the link I don't hear for press

05:58.580 --> 05:59.350
tab.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.710
You can see right away that we're going to have a link open.

06:02.760 --> 06:03.990
This is going to be done mealing.

06:04.020 --> 06:06.580
So we're going to place a hash tag over here.

06:06.810 --> 06:09.730
And then within the link We're going to have a phantasm.

06:09.780 --> 06:15.330
So I'm going to say again that this is going to be for an hour here the class is going to be light.

06:15.440 --> 06:23.070

06:28.080 --> 06:32.750
So now we're done with HVM now for our header.

06:32.850 --> 06:39.850
We're going right over here maybe a comment that this is going to be the end of error here and there.

06:39.970 --> 06:42.190
Right then we're going to say this.

06:42.340 --> 06:47.910
And now we're ready to move on to reassess and actually start styling this.
