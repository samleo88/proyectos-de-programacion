00:00.510 --> 00:06.900
So let's go to main sources here all the way in the bottom as always we're all just going to say this

00:06.900 --> 00:08.500
is going to be a post.

00:08.500 --> 00:09.220
Right.

00:09.330 --> 00:15.960
So your posts are going to create a lot a lot of space right because there's going to be quite a few

00:15.960 --> 00:18.090
rules that warning you right away.

00:18.130 --> 00:20.940
I want to start over here with the most basic one posts right.

00:20.970 --> 00:26.040
So what we would want for the post and we're going to say this is going to have a background and the

00:26.080 --> 00:27.810
background as being hash.

00:28.140 --> 00:31.310
B E B are here like this.

00:31.350 --> 00:33.840
And then it's going to be seventy four seventy four.

00:33.930 --> 00:34.710
All right.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.720
Now that we have this padding.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.240
Twenty pixels.

00:38.310 --> 00:40.490
Then we're going to have a zero.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.830
It's going to be 80 pixels and then have zero on it.

00:43.990 --> 00:50.550
So we're going to set up the batting and then we're going to have a post container post container and

00:50.690 --> 00:56.740
here we're going to save the max with here and we're going to say this is going to be 90.

00:56.870 --> 01:00.420
You right and then we're going to have a margin.

01:00.420 --> 01:02.140
0 auto Right.

01:02.150 --> 01:05.590
And again we're just placing the actual whole container in the center.

01:05.790 --> 01:10.920
And then we're going to have a post item know this and we're going to say this is going to be background

01:10.920 --> 01:18.870
color and I'm going to say it's going to be hash tag e 0 we no longer have to be right.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.850
So something like this is 0.

01:22.020 --> 01:24.200
And two DBI right.

01:24.270 --> 01:32.530
So then we go ahead and say color and the color is going to be hash tag 1 9 1 7 1 6 1 7 1 6.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.710
This is going to be our color.

01:34.800 --> 01:39.960
And then over here we're going to say this is going to be more margin and we're going to say 20 pixels

01:40.770 --> 01:42.790
right and 0 right.

01:42.810 --> 01:45.120
So that's going to be margin in between them right.

01:45.290 --> 01:49.760
So now we're done with post item would go to the actual post image.

01:49.760 --> 01:53.600
So here I'm going to say post an image.

01:53.680 --> 01:59.360
Right so now we're just targeting the image and we're going to say this is going to be worth more here.

01:59.460 --> 02:02.470
I'm going to say 100 percent on this.

02:02.510 --> 02:06.300
I'm going to say this is going to be this black block right.

02:06.300 --> 02:10.660
So now that we have this we would want a image container.

02:10.910 --> 02:15.210
So we're going to go here and we're going to say image container.

02:15.330 --> 02:19.630
I'm not going to say this is going to be position relative.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.310
Right.

02:20.400 --> 02:29.100
And the background and the magnet is going to be a linear linear gradient gradient and again this is

02:29.100 --> 02:43.800
going to be R-GA G.P.A. 0 0 0 0 7 and then you're going to LGB a 0 0 0 0 7 right.

02:43.860 --> 02:45.630
So maybe we can change the rate.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.730
Maybe it's going to be a little darker maybe it looks nicer.

02:48.730 --> 02:50.110
So zero way.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.470
Zero.

02:52.000 --> 02:52.650
All right.

02:52.660 --> 02:59.850
So two of them are here now do we have this one image container phantasm.

03:00.090 --> 03:05.560
So we go here class image container over here.

03:05.570 --> 03:07.180
We're going to see some.

03:07.650 --> 03:15.750
And what we would want is position to say absolute and then this is going to be left 50 percent and

03:15.750 --> 03:25.530
it's going to be bottom or top 50 percent top or here 50 percent then we're going to have a transformer

03:25.530 --> 03:36.210
translate transform translate and it's going to be negative 50 percent and again negative 50 percent.

03:36.250 --> 03:40.340
Right so now that we have this we would want a font size.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.190
We're going to say this is going to be 50 pixels.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.770
So it's going to be quite a big one right.

03:45.810 --> 03:48.680
Then the color Natcore we're going to go with yellow.

03:48.840 --> 03:54.990
So e six A F E F TO.

03:55.630 --> 04:01.580
So now we have this would want a transition and transition is going to be opacity.

04:01.780 --> 04:05.020
I see no real way to say for four seconds.

04:05.040 --> 04:05.780
Right.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.620
And over here the actual opacity.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.520
Right away set it is zero.

04:09.540 --> 04:15.880
Right so if it is sitting right now I can see it but obviously once we're all going to be hovering we

04:15.880 --> 04:16.780
will to be able to.

04:16.790 --> 04:17.590
Right.

04:17.610 --> 04:20.700
So obviously all here where is the image container.

04:20.690 --> 04:23.480
And so it over here right away.

04:23.640 --> 04:27.090
Copy and paste.

04:27.210 --> 04:29.340
I can just say hover right.

04:29.340 --> 04:31.480
And what should happen as we're hovering.

04:31.580 --> 04:37.740
We're going to say this is going to be Pasotti and this is going to be zero point four here.

04:37.980 --> 04:42.510
And then for the actual image right here the same image.

04:42.780 --> 04:45.300
And then the next one is going to be for the phantasm.

04:45.400 --> 04:53.790
So copy and paste are going to go here and we're going to say font awesome awesome and opacity is going

04:53.790 --> 04:54.480
to be one.

04:54.480 --> 05:01.290
All right so one is actually going to be losing the capacity right image the actual phantasm is actually

05:01.290 --> 05:02.120
going to be gaining.

05:02.130 --> 05:02.610
Right.

05:02.820 --> 05:07.890
So if we go back over here we're Bajun C check it out.

05:07.900 --> 05:08.580
All right.

05:08.620 --> 05:15.380
I can see that this one is actually losing capacity right and phantasms appearing.

05:15.490 --> 05:18.000
Now there's one issue right.

05:18.060 --> 05:20.810
Right now those images are really big.

05:20.850 --> 05:21.160
Right.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.870
So we're obviously going to need to go and work on that.

05:23.870 --> 05:24.330
Right.

05:24.510 --> 05:31.300
So we're going to go ahead or here and we're going to say this is going to be a text container and all

05:31.300 --> 05:32.970
this is going to have a paddings.

05:32.970 --> 05:33.790
All right.

05:33.810 --> 05:38.970
So I'm going to go all the way over here and the bottom and we're going to say this is going to be text

05:39.850 --> 05:41.380
contained there.

05:41.480 --> 05:41.780
Right.

05:41.880 --> 05:50.220
And we're going to say this is going to be a paddings will say padding 10 pixels going to 5 pixels of

05:50.330 --> 05:54.060
30 pixels and it will have five pixels high.

05:54.360 --> 06:03.030
So we're going to have like this it will have a margin for a actual paragraph text container.

06:03.120 --> 06:11.730
And this is going to be for a paragraph on the same margin 15 pixels or hear 15 pixels that are we're

06:11.730 --> 06:13.420
going to have a zero.

06:13.470 --> 06:17.150
And then we're going to 25 pixels and it zero again.

06:17.510 --> 06:18.890
So something like this.

06:18.990 --> 06:23.970
And then we're going to have a text container text container

06:26.490 --> 06:30.330
danger and then we're going to have a link right.

06:30.360 --> 06:39.150
And what happened to the link when I say text decoration on one down the line they don't want a font

06:39.150 --> 06:50.460
size 20 pixels and let's make a semi colon padding padding is going to be five pixels.

06:51.030 --> 06:57.030
Then we're going to have a border here of two big TSOs solid.

06:57.060 --> 06:58.490
And this is needs to be here.

06:58.540 --> 07:02.030
So we're going to see e 6.

07:02.400 --> 07:06.410
An EF 2 EF 2.

07:06.690 --> 07:07.200
Right.

07:07.310 --> 07:10.660
So now that we have this we would want a color also.

07:10.650 --> 07:17.070
And we're going to have the same one that's so color and more use the same one here was going to grab

07:17.070 --> 07:22.470
this guy and copy over here and say paste.

07:22.690 --> 07:31.880
Right so now the color has changed and we would want a margin about 20 pixels on this so we just moved

07:31.890 --> 07:36.480
up a little bit and then we would want as we're hovering right now that's going to be the last one before

07:36.480 --> 07:40.180
the media before we actually make and responsive.

07:40.230 --> 07:46.200
So we're going to go over here and we're going to copy this and paste it over here I'm going to say

07:46.300 --> 07:49.140
however and what should happen is we're hovering.

07:49.140 --> 07:50.450
We're going to change the colors.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.130
So we'll see background color.

07:53.320 --> 07:57.880
And this is going to be hash tag 1 9 1 7 1 6 right.

07:57.900 --> 07:59.040
So the black one.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.250
And obviously the color is going to be the same.

08:02.250 --> 08:06.870
All right so we're going to go here I'm going to say this is going to be water.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.900
Water color is going to be the same right.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.380
So check it out.

08:11.400 --> 08:11.660
Right.

08:11.660 --> 08:16.710
So as you can see as important as how it's going to look and then we have a media screen that's going

08:16.710 --> 08:19.270
to be to last ones for the media screen.

08:19.710 --> 08:23.060
We're here we're going to say that this is going to be here.

08:23.640 --> 08:24.830
Yes.

08:25.060 --> 08:25.670
We're here.

08:25.680 --> 08:32.380
I'm going to say and I don't know what year this was a little bit too early but we needed to see a man

08:33.540 --> 08:42.670
with men all going to say 5 6 7 5 7 6 0 here and then we're going to close this one out and then we're

08:42.690 --> 08:53.390
going to have a post or a container or you doing this and then we're going to say this play and then

08:53.400 --> 09:03.390
we're going to have a great template columns grid template Cong's here template columns and then we're

09:03.390 --> 09:05.860
going to say this is going to be repeat right.

09:05.880 --> 09:09.250
And we're going to have two and one for action.

09:09.330 --> 09:09.540
Right.

09:09.540 --> 09:10.920
So something like this.

09:11.130 --> 09:20.900
Then we're going to have a grid column gap grid column gap or call them gap and we're here we're going

09:20.910 --> 09:28.690
to say this is going to be one of them and then great program grade Roe gap.

09:28.770 --> 09:33.540
So this is going to be in between the rows we're going to say one him and what we would want to do is

09:33.540 --> 09:40.140
just copy this or order change this one to 9 9 2.

09:40.190 --> 09:41.720
I'm going to go into.

09:42.030 --> 09:45.310
And of course this is going to be repeated is going to be three.

09:45.630 --> 09:50.780
And once we're done over here with our media screens we just go back to our page.

09:50.820 --> 09:51.190
Right.

09:51.240 --> 09:54.730
And we can refresh and you can see that this is we're all going to have right.

09:54.730 --> 10:02.420
So this is going to be three posts font or some search or here and if we try to make it smaller right

10:02.700 --> 10:03.890
then it's going to be two of them.

10:03.890 --> 10:04.160
Right.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.170
The same thing.

10:05.330 --> 10:08.020
And if we got a smaller screen this is going to be one of them.

10:08.030 --> 10:08.600
Right.

10:08.660 --> 10:11.680
And this is how we can get done with this section.

10:11.780 --> 10:14.920
And the last section we have left is actually a footer section.
