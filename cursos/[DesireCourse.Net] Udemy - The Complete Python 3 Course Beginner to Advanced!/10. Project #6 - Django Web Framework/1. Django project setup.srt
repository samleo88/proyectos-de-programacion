1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,690
Alright guys, welcome back. So we are done with the Webpy subsection of section 5,

2

00:00:06,690  -->  00:00:11,759
and that was pretty big, was bigger than
I initially expected. And so with that

3

00:00:11,759  -->  00:00:17,850
being as big as it was, I think right at
this point we're at about almost seven hours

4

00:00:17,850  -->  00:00:23,820
into the course, something like that. So,
judging by how big that

5

00:00:23,820  -->  00:00:27,420
module was itself, and I think that was
about an hour and a half or two hours

6

00:00:27,420  -->  00:00:32,520
just on webpy, I think the entire course
is going to be pretty big, so I hope you

7

00:00:32,520  -->  00:00:34,050
guys are happy with that.

8

00:00:34,050  -->  00:00:41,309
Also, we are taking suggestions if you
guys want any other modules, or Python

9

00:00:41,309  -->  00:00:46,320
packages, or maybe even concepts if I
don't explain something that you want to

10

00:00:46,320  -->  00:00:47,129
learn

11

00:00:47,129  -->  00:00:51,899
let me know and we can see about doing that. I'm completely open to adding as much as you

12

00:00:51,899  -->  00:00:57,059
guys want into this course. So right now
we're going to be covering the Django

13

00:00:57,059  -->  00:01:01,199
module in Python, and what we need to do is actually go ahead and install

14

00:01:01,199  -->  00:01:05,400
Django. So to do this type "pip3

15

00:01:05,909  -->  00:01:12,330
install Django" with a capital "D." I've
already got this installed so you're

16

00:01:12,330  -->  00:01:15,390
going to see this message here telling
me that i've already got it installed.

17

00:01:15,390  -->  00:01:19,799
It should install pretty quickly for you
guys, just wait until it's done, and

18

00:01:19,799  -->  00:01:23,280
then what you're going to do is if you
do have PyCharm installed, and I hope you

19

00:01:23,280  -->  00:01:26,369
guys do just because it's going to make
things a lot easier when i'm doing stuff

20

00:01:26,369  -->  00:01:31,140
that you guys can do exactly what I'm
doing, going to change into the

21

00:01:31,140  -->  00:01:37,140
"cd PycharmProjects" directory, and here we are actually going to use Django admin. So,

22

00:01:37,140  -->  00:01:41,430
you guys should have access to this command now that you've got Django

23

00:01:41,430  -->  00:01:48,270
installed, so run "django-admin startproject" and then we're going to name the

24

00:01:48,270  -->  00:01:53,250
project so i'm going to name it "mysite"
Now if you run the "ls" command you'll see

25

00:01:53,250  -->  00:02:00,030
that it's created a new directory here
called mysite, so let's change into my

26

00:02:00,030  -->  00:02:02,670
site "cd mysite" and let's list.

27

00:02:02,670  -->  00:02:07,439
I'm going to go ahead and open PyCharm actually, and i'm going to open that directory an

28

00:02:08,129  -->  00:02:11,280
we're gonna have a look here at what
we've got.

29

00:02:11,280  -->  00:02:12,819
So by the default

30

00:02:12,819  -->  00:02:17,620
Django has created some applications, well some files, for us. We will get into the manage.py

31

00:02:17,620  -->  00:02:21,310
in a moment, first we're
going to go over these files here and go

32

00:02:21,310  -->  00:02:22,359
over what they are.

33

00:02:22,359  -->  00:02:29,590
This is a blank file. You guys know why
there's a blank file titled __init__, you

34

00:02:29,590  -->  00:02:33,849
should if you don't recall basically
that lets us load any files in this

35

00:02:33,849  -->  00:02:41,169
directory into other Python packages as
a package. The settings file is going to

36

00:02:41,169  -->  00:02:47,500
contain specific configurations for the
Django project. It includes installed apps

37

00:02:47,500  -->  00:02:52,209
and what and app is, the difference between a project and app in Django, is let's say we're

38

00:02:52,209  -->  00:02:56,859
about to build Facebook. The project
would be Facebook, but then there would be

39

00:02:56,859  -->  00:03:01,480
multiple apps existing inside the
project as well. So an app might be the

40

00:03:01,480  -->  00:03:08,409
messages, or you know status updates,
comments, maybe groups, etc., so each

41

00:03:08,409  -->  00:03:13,090
kind of component is its own app and it
keeps it separate, keeps it clean, so

42

00:03:13,090  -->  00:03:21,790
that's why we do that. The urls is regex
based so if you guys don't feel you're

43

00:03:21,790  -->  00:03:26,079
that strong regex, and I know i'm not,
i'm doing my best to get better at it

44

00:03:26,079  -->  00:03:33,489
but it just, I mean it's simple, I
just never use it. So, yeah, I

45

00:03:33,489  -->  00:03:41,259
don't generally create web applications
with Python, so that's why you know in

46

00:03:41,259  -->  00:03:45,250
Python regex is really useful for
that kind of stuff and I've used it a

47

00:03:45,250  -->  00:03:46,599
little bit before in

48

00:03:46,599  -->  00:03:51,220
javascript when I need it, but the use
doesn't really come up that often with a

49

00:03:51,220  -->  00:03:58,930
need for it. So, and the wsgi file its
going to allow you to run let's say

50

00:03:58,930  -->  00:04:04,299
Apache, the Apache server, and then run
this application or this project on that

51

00:04:04,299  -->  00:04:10,150
server, so that's what those files are for.
Now the manage.py file, let's open this, you

52

00:04:10,150  -->  00:04:14,500
guys don't need to do anything in here,
we're actually going to leave this

53

00:04:14,500  -->  00:04:19,810
entirely alone, but this is what it looks
like. This lets us run specific commands

54

00:04:19,810  -->  00:04:22,810
to manage your project as you can guess
it's called manage.

55

00:04:24,290  -->  00:04:31,100
So what we're gonna do I'm gonna go
ahead open terminal here, and what we're

56

00:04:31,100  -->  00:04:38,030
going to do, I am in this directory, so
run "python3 ./manage.py" and then it's

57

00:04:38,030  -->  00:04:41,930
going to take an argument and the
argument is going to define what we're

58

00:04:41,930  -->  00:04:45,860
going to do. So, for instance, you can sync up the database again, you can create the

59

00:04:45,860  -->  00:04:50,120
database, and what we're going to do
right now is just type "runserver" and

60

00:04:50,120  -->  00:04:54,830
that's all one word, and this is going to
run the web server. You'll see this

61

00:04:54,830  -->  00:04:57,950
message, we're not going to worry about
that right now, we're just going to copy

62

00:04:57,950  -->  00:05:05,450
this right here, we're going to go into
our browser and paste that in, and you

63

00:05:05,450  -->  00:05:13,250
should see this page. We haven't done
anything yet and so you see this message

64

00:05:13,250  -->  00:05:20,060
and in the next video we're going to
start doing stuff with Django.

65

00:05:20,060  -->  00:05:25,340
If you already have something running on
port 8000, thats cool, because what we

66

00:05:25,340  -->  00:05:32,180
can do, cancel that, when you run the
server you can specify the IP address

67

00:05:32,180  -->  00:05:34,160
and port that you want to run on.

68

00:05:34,160  -->  00:05:43,160
So for instance i'm going to run "python3 ./manage.py runserver 4500" Now if

69

00:05:43,160  -->  00:05:49,490
I wanted to run it on port 4500 I would
do that, and as you can see it's running

70

00:05:49,490  -->  00:05:56,870
on port 4500 and I would access it on that port in my browser. So, thank you guys for

71

00:05:56,870  -->  00:06:01,520
watching this video. You should be set up
with Django and we should be able to

72

00:06:01,520  -->  00:06:07,370
move on and actually do stuff in Django,
and remember this is based on top of the

73

00:06:07,370  -->  00:06:11,780
Python language, it's built on Python,
however a lot of the stuff here is not

74

00:06:11,780  -->  00:06:16,250
just standard you know custom a Python
that you're going to be writing. It's

75

00:06:16,250  -->  00:06:21,530
going to be Django specific code and so
that's why we need to do this, so let's

76

00:06:21,530  -->  00:06:22,030
get started.
