WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:04.740
The next section are all going to be building is going to be pricing section.

00:04.740 --> 00:10.360
All right so we're going to have a back ground on this.

00:10.530 --> 00:15.550
And over here we're going out you can see the middle one is going to have a white background.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.340
And over here this is all of a pricing.

00:18.540 --> 00:21.250
And you can see that we're going to have it irresponsive.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.800
And so we're here now is going to make two of them.

00:23.970 --> 00:28.710
And if we got on the smaller screen here now it's going to be single pricing.

00:28.710 --> 00:35.110
So let's go back over here and let's actually go to next HD now and this.

00:35.260 --> 00:42.590
And let's find out where is the end of our previous section which was the progress Marsh going on here

00:42.600 --> 00:44.250
we already know the drill.

00:44.370 --> 00:49.700
I'm going to say this is going to be a pricing section here.

00:49.800 --> 00:53.620
We're going to collect a line here and this.

00:53.660 --> 00:58.380
We're going to select on line and we're going to say control the line here.

00:58.380 --> 01:00.280
Copy this don't really want to say.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.530
And of pricing.

01:02.880 --> 01:07.300
And then after that what we would want is actually a title.

01:07.350 --> 01:13.150
So we go back over here where we have the title because we have to have the title somewhere right.

01:13.190 --> 01:19.630
So the closest one is going to be here and we're going to have a copy and paste it here right.

01:19.670 --> 01:20.790
So I'm going to select this.

01:20.790 --> 01:22.640
This is going to be me our team.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.340
So this is going to be different.

01:24.480 --> 01:29.580
And here we're going to say first that it's going to be s. And out here I'm going to say the pricing

01:30.340 --> 01:33.020
on this and then we'll have a title.

01:33.050 --> 01:36.880
So copy and paste title here this is not going to be users.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.440
We're going to save money here.

01:39.570 --> 01:45.510
And then after that we're going to say our amazing prices so we're going to say we're here our amazing

01:45.510 --> 01:49.530
prices are amazing.

01:50.490 --> 01:52.180
Prices are here.

01:52.230 --> 01:58.490
So once we have this let's actually go to a next section right now.

01:58.650 --> 02:03.480
Next section actually next item that we're going to be building is actual content.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.090
Right.

02:04.110 --> 02:09.960
So we're really going to say this we're going to say that this is going to be Divx with a class of pricing

02:10.480 --> 02:14.340
and center on this press tab.

02:14.580 --> 02:22.720
And once we have this we're going right and this is going to be a pricing card pricing card here.

02:22.730 --> 02:29.760
So the line again copy and paste are really going to say end of pricing card and all we're here with

02:29.790 --> 02:33.010
we're going to write is that this is going to be hard to go.

02:33.240 --> 02:39.240
And then this is going to be class of pricing and we're going to say card right just so there's some

02:39.240 --> 02:40.710
kind of distinction.

02:40.740 --> 02:45.900
So this is going to be a pricing card and we're going to start very simple we're going to say a heading

02:45.900 --> 02:48.990
3 is going to be a startup.

02:49.050 --> 02:53.240
So this is how we're named this one we're going to say this is going to be $0.

02:53.490 --> 02:54.830
So I can copy and paste this.

02:54.830 --> 03:00.380
This is going to be page 1 and we're going to say we're here this is going to be zero dollars.

03:00.630 --> 03:09.300
So dollars is zero here then we're going to have a on our list here with a list items.

03:09.300 --> 03:09.530
Right.

03:09.530 --> 03:18.100
So we can press NABO here and the first list item actually is going to have a class of price list here

03:18.200 --> 03:19.160
like this.

03:19.170 --> 03:24.580
And then we're going to say that this is going to have a I high we're here a.

03:24.870 --> 03:25.590
And they're failing.

03:25.590 --> 03:31.400
So we're all going to say that this is going to be a unfinished right because we're going on our own.

03:31.680 --> 03:40.280
And also what you want is a paragraph here paragraph is going to be saying sharing sharing or your tools

03:40.580 --> 03:41.080
right.

03:41.210 --> 03:50.940
And all this we can actually have it in parentheses like this multiplied by three or four like this.

03:50.940 --> 03:53.130
And then once we have this press table or here.

03:53.130 --> 03:53.810
Right.

03:53.810 --> 03:56.480
So now we have five of them.

03:56.580 --> 04:00.130
We're here now as they are here we're going to have to rewrite it a little bit.

04:00.300 --> 04:03.200
And this is going to be a different fund to us.

04:03.420 --> 04:05.630
So the first one is going to be check.

04:05.940 --> 04:08.350
The second one is also going to be check.

04:08.590 --> 04:15.570
Then this one is going to be times and this is also going to be times like this and for names we're

04:15.570 --> 04:21.690
going to have a sharing tools then over here we're going to do this and we're going to say design tools.

04:21.840 --> 04:29.780
And then over here we're going to say Private Messages like this are going to say private messages and

04:29.780 --> 04:36.350
then we're going to have a personal brand so right here and this is going to be a personal brand over

04:36.350 --> 04:37.390
here.

04:37.420 --> 04:42.530
Then after that we would want actually a link.

04:42.530 --> 04:42.800
All right.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.520
So after this.

04:44.870 --> 04:48.380
Well now we're list what actually want a link.

04:48.380 --> 04:49.350
So we're here on the right.

04:49.350 --> 04:54.170
And this is going to be link hashtag over here for a actual target.

04:54.170 --> 04:54.830
Right.

04:54.860 --> 04:58.310
And I'm going to say upgrade plan here.

04:58.460 --> 05:00.350
So this is going to be our first.

05:00.630 --> 05:01.460
Priceless right.

05:01.460 --> 05:04.430
And obviously we would need three of them.

05:04.450 --> 05:07.960
Right so here we can just grab this one over here.

05:07.970 --> 05:11.010
It's going to be end of pricing in one to two.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.910
These are going to be two copies.

05:12.980 --> 05:18.350
Next one we're going to write and this is going to be a pro pro on let's say over here this is going

05:18.350 --> 05:21.600
to be $15 we're like this.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.820
And the last one is going to be commercials going to be hundred dollars.

05:25.220 --> 05:29.010
So here all going right commercial commercial.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.380
Hopefully I'm spelling it correctly.

05:31.380 --> 05:34.210
If not then I do apologize.

05:34.380 --> 05:36.150
And here this is going to be like this.

05:36.150 --> 05:42.360
Right so now our age the amount is actually set up right now.

05:42.420 --> 05:51.930
What we would want over here is actually saying this over here and we're going to go to a man who says

05:52.480 --> 05:59.730
I like this one to scroll all the way in the bottom of progress bars we're going to start styling the

05:59.730 --> 06:02.260
pricing section and so we'll do it all.

06:02.260 --> 06:04.830
Here we have links here right.

06:04.830 --> 06:07.020
And here I'm going to say pricing.

06:07.110 --> 06:10.870
It's going to be the name of the section copy till the end.

06:10.940 --> 06:15.690
Here we're going to started from scratch right now what I'm going to do over here is I'm just going

06:15.690 --> 06:18.700
to make more room like this.

06:18.810 --> 06:25.620
And then once we have the pricing then we're going to have a hash tag pricing or here or here we're

06:25.620 --> 06:30.910
going to write a parting first for the whole section 40 pixels and zero.

06:31.060 --> 06:37.580
It's only for the top and bottom left or right or is going to leave it like the way it is for here this

06:37.590 --> 06:42.280
is going to be background stack one line here.

06:42.450 --> 06:45.750
1 9 1 9 1 9.

06:45.770 --> 06:52.830
So this is going to be completely black then or here we would want a pricing right.

06:52.910 --> 06:58.980
And then we would want a target of title heading I remembered his generic title that we had right for

06:58.980 --> 07:03.410
the title heading adding or here we're going to write like this right.

07:03.510 --> 07:10.080
We're going to say that this is going to be a color and the color is going to be hashtag FFC 9 1 for

07:10.360 --> 07:11.490
all of this.

07:11.500 --> 07:11.730
Right.

07:11.730 --> 07:15.950
So basically we're adding the yellow color over here.

07:16.050 --> 07:19.570
The next thing we have is a div of pricing center.

07:19.590 --> 07:25.080
So the divide that holds all these pricings right here we're going to say that this is going to be class

07:25.080 --> 07:35.970
pricing and this is going to be center on here and we're going to say Macs with Macs with to 90 percent.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.540
You're like this.

07:37.570 --> 07:40.420
Going to say margin 0 0 0.

07:40.620 --> 07:41.220
Right.

07:41.240 --> 07:46.160
So basically you can see it and right now we're placing them exactly in the center.

07:46.580 --> 07:49.590
Then after that we would want to work with actual pricing card.

07:49.760 --> 07:57.380
So I'm going to say pricing here and I'm going to say cart this right so each and every class or here

07:57.380 --> 08:03.010
we're going to say text on line center you know like this.

08:03.060 --> 08:12.160
Then after that we would want a color and I'm going to have a color of hashtag 5 3 5 right here.

08:12.240 --> 08:19.460
Then the padding is going to be 30 pixels like this and padding to the left and right is going to be

08:19.470 --> 08:27.390
zero right to padding on the top bottom and margin also right so in between the actual cards 30 pixels

08:27.510 --> 08:28.870
and zero again.

08:29.020 --> 08:29.240
Right.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.160
So this is going to be in between.

08:31.530 --> 08:35.320
Then next we're going to dial this on our list.

08:35.510 --> 08:46.090
So I'm going to say Preissing you know this and it's actually Preissing card here you know here we're

08:46.140 --> 08:49.840
going to write that this is going to be a list style type.

08:50.070 --> 08:51.790
I'm going to say none right.

08:51.810 --> 08:58.440
So get rid of these annoying bullet points and then next one I would want to work with this you see

08:58.440 --> 09:01.120
this awesome writing sharing tools.

09:01.310 --> 09:07.570
And if you remember over here this was actually under this ally right that has a class of priceless.

09:07.850 --> 09:08.160
Right.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.500
So what I would want to do.

09:09.870 --> 09:14.000
Well what I would want to do is or here I'm really just going to create First of all.

09:15.410 --> 09:22.160
And then we're going to say here class and we're going to say class of Preissing cardigan and we're

09:22.170 --> 09:25.740
going to have a hundred list and a list item on it like this.

09:25.860 --> 09:30.050
And once we have them I'm going to say this play flex.

09:30.060 --> 09:32.640
So first of all get them all on line like this.

09:32.680 --> 09:36.610
And then we're going to have a justified content center.

09:36.760 --> 09:40.620
So we're going to move them to center more June 20 pixels.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.060
I don't know we're here to say we're going to say zero.

09:43.470 --> 09:48.530
So margin is basically in between right and 0 is undersides.

09:48.540 --> 09:53.270
Now we have this let's actually work with a heading three.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.480
And then having one.

09:55.560 --> 10:00.440
So here I'm going to say this is going to be a pricing card.

10:00.820 --> 10:08.390
Adding three more here I'm going to say color and the color is going to be hashtags 0 0.

10:08.430 --> 10:13.080
A We're going to have a seven easy one here.

10:13.180 --> 10:19.590
So this is when we're going to have and then we're going to have a text transfer transform capitalize

10:19.990 --> 10:25.210
on this font size 40 pixels on this.

10:25.440 --> 10:29.100
So now we have a big pixels for having three.

10:29.220 --> 10:31.770
And then our want for her heading one.

10:31.840 --> 10:42.130
Right so I'm going to say pricing card having one on this same margin 40 pixels and 0.

10:42.150 --> 10:48.250
So again only top and bottom and font size and say 60 pixels.

10:48.420 --> 10:49.390
Right.

10:49.680 --> 10:55.260
Then once we have this let's work over here with these little phantasms it's so good to see or hear

10:55.260 --> 11:01.840
price and we're going to say list here because that's the name of the class price list and we're going

11:01.850 --> 11:03.560
to say that font are some glass.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.360
Right.

11:04.410 --> 11:12.390
So here we're going to say font size and this is going to be 25 pixels on this margin right.

11:12.390 --> 11:20.790
We're going to say it's a 10 or 10 pixels or so just push a little bit away and then next would we would

11:20.790 --> 11:24.810
want to do is actually work with a lynx.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.790
All right so with this link or here.

11:27.060 --> 11:32.110
So this is going to have a quite a bit of properties and values right.

11:32.130 --> 11:40.250
So I'm going to say pricing hard going to say first of all going to say this should be display.

11:40.620 --> 11:43.000
We're going to say inline block right.

11:43.080 --> 11:47.570
So it has the actual margins and padding right.

11:47.580 --> 11:51.620
They're all going to say a text decoration.

11:51.850 --> 11:53.150
I'm going to say none.

11:53.220 --> 12:02.580
We're going to get rid of this annoying on the line font size 25 pixels ruling this text here transform

12:02.940 --> 12:13.230
we're going to say a case like this padding we're going to say 10 pixels and 30 pixels so 10 pixels

12:13.230 --> 12:22.090
time bottom and 30 pixels side and that all we're going to say more and more is going to be a two pixel

12:22.090 --> 12:31.460
solid solid and we're going to say hashtag five three or five here and then we'll have also the color.

12:31.630 --> 12:38.020
And so the text color also is going to be the same so we're going to say five of three five doing this

12:38.340 --> 12:45.570
and then we'll have a border radius and it's going to be 20 pixels like this so then we're going to

12:45.570 --> 12:51.990
have a nice round the edges and then we would want a transition right so as we're transition I'm going

12:51.990 --> 12:55.640
to say transition and what we want the transition background.

12:55.780 --> 13:02.010
So as we're having two seconds ease again ease then we're going to have a color.

13:02.310 --> 13:04.900
Also two seconds each.

13:05.280 --> 13:09.950
So these are shouldn't be two things that were actually hovering right.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.460
They should change.

13:11.670 --> 13:13.650
Here now would want a pricing card.

13:13.650 --> 13:23.110
However some would say pricing card a and or hover it once we have this we're going to say collor hashtag

13:23.860 --> 13:28.020
here 1 9 1 9 1 9 like this.

13:28.020 --> 13:32.940
And then we have a background and the background is going to be hashtag 00.

13:33.130 --> 13:37.020
And this is going to be a seven easy one.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.250
We're having this right.

13:39.340 --> 13:44.530
And then I will have also the border color and border color is going to be exactly the same because

13:44.530 --> 13:51.760
if we go back over here right you can see that for now the border color is actually staying white and

13:51.760 --> 13:52.910
we don't want that.

13:52.940 --> 13:56.280
And so as we were having the border colors should be exactly the same.

13:56.560 --> 14:00.770
So border color in this.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.800
And then we just need to grab this guy.

14:04.220 --> 14:05.080
All right.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.480
So the blue color.

14:06.960 --> 14:14.590
So I'm going to copy this and copy and paste and now would we would want to do is actually add this

14:14.620 --> 14:19.330
middle one right so you can see or hear it in our final one right.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.980
We have this guy on here that looks different.

14:21.980 --> 14:26.860
All right you can see that first on the link is different and everything else.

14:27.130 --> 14:28.830
So how we would want to do that.

14:29.110 --> 14:32.420
So the way we're going to do this more here.

14:32.620 --> 14:40.300
Well we're going to go back to the exchange to him now and we're going out actually a custom or to the

14:40.300 --> 14:41.360
middle one.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.020
Right.

14:42.040 --> 14:48.850
So if we have a pricing card basically to the middle one what are we going to do is to say that the

14:48.850 --> 14:52.570
middle one actually has a class of custom.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.460
So let's find where is the middle one.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.330
Of all right so this was start up.

14:56.440 --> 15:03.130
This was Preux was the class was going to write custom you know this and then we're going to go back

15:03.130 --> 15:07.640
to making sense and actually style this custom.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.270
So again all the way in the.

15:10.310 --> 15:16.990
All right we're going to make more room or he'll going to say custom custom over we're here for the

15:16.990 --> 15:19.170
customer we're going to have a background.

15:19.690 --> 15:22.630
I wish I 5:53 five right.

15:22.750 --> 15:34.160
That's first then we'll have a caller just type 1 9 1 9 1 9 hash tag 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 9 9 so this is going

15:34.160 --> 15:44.500
to be the black one border radius 30 pixels border radius and we're going to save 30 pixels something

15:44.500 --> 15:45.460
like this.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.990
And then after that we would want a transition.

15:49.250 --> 15:50.820
So has we're hovering.

15:50.830 --> 15:52.580
Things should change right here.

15:52.630 --> 15:58.040
I'm going to say transform form I'm going to take two seconds each.

15:58.550 --> 16:03.840
And over here we're going to do is as we're hovering actually it's going to lift up our mind so I'm

16:03.840 --> 16:13.210
going to say Kustom and we're going to say however we're here we're going to write a transform and here

16:13.210 --> 16:16.450
we're going to say translate and why translate.

16:16.540 --> 16:21.840
And we're going to say one and we're going to set it to negative 20 pixels more like this.

16:22.060 --> 16:22.450
Right.

16:22.570 --> 16:28.600
So what's happening is as I'm hammering you can see that the actual middle section it's actually lifting

16:28.600 --> 16:29.960
up right.

16:30.100 --> 16:37.030
And then no one actually style this link so I'm going to go back already and see that I would want Actually

16:37.030 --> 16:38.530
this link to be different.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.640
And because right now it doesn't work the way I want.

16:41.680 --> 16:48.610
So here where I'm going to say this is going to be custom and easy here and I'm going to say color is

16:48.610 --> 16:56.610
going to be hash tag FFC 9:1 for this and border color is also going to be the same rights.

16:56.620 --> 17:00.570
I'm going to say more color not collapse.

17:00.580 --> 17:04.060
This is going to be color or hill going right.

17:04.070 --> 17:07.100
And hash tag FFC 9:24.

17:07.660 --> 17:13.500
So the border color is going to be the same as we're actually hovering background and border colors

17:13.500 --> 17:15.620
should change right.

17:15.660 --> 17:25.000
So here what I'm going to say this is going to be a custom custom A were right and are really going

17:25.000 --> 17:29.520
to write a background which I can see 9 1 for.

17:29.980 --> 17:35.590
And we're going to have a border color and this is going to be hash tag.

17:35.700 --> 17:38.620
See and one for right.

17:38.890 --> 17:42.700
And we just save this we can say the next page.

17:42.740 --> 17:47.030
And now we're here and I can just check it out.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.080
What do we have.

17:48.280 --> 17:48.550
Right.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.580
So as we scroll down.

17:50.670 --> 17:59.050
Right so this is going to be our button right now and we would want is obviously had a responsiveness.

17:59.270 --> 18:03.600
So it looks something similar to this as we're actually changing the screen.

18:03.710 --> 18:04.030
Right.

18:04.040 --> 18:07.680
You can see that now there's three of them in one right.

18:07.700 --> 18:12.320
So we're going to we're going to do a screen right.

18:12.350 --> 18:18.290
We're going to go back over here and we're going to find out where it is where it was on Main.

18:18.300 --> 18:18.660
Yes.

18:18.650 --> 18:20.020
Yes.

18:20.120 --> 18:31.130
Here we're going to say Mijnheer I want you to say screen so here on your screen and we remain with

18:31.890 --> 18:41.750
you on this and then we're going to say a pricing center here or here we're going to say with them we're

18:41.750 --> 18:45.180
going to say the West is actually going to be hundred percent.

18:45.270 --> 18:48.410
So as the screen gets bigger we don't need this anymore.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.980
We're going to say this play flux.

18:51.030 --> 18:57.980
So this play as a fox marks justify content space between right so we always fill up all the space that

18:57.980 --> 18:59.660
there is flex.

18:59.660 --> 19:04.640
Rap is once we get to the smaller screen so it actually is rapping.

19:04.920 --> 19:05.590
Right.

19:05.630 --> 19:08.390
And then what we would want is a pricing car.

19:08.780 --> 19:09.130
Right.

19:09.140 --> 19:17.150
And here we're going to say is for the class of pricing card what we would want and we would want flex

19:18.360 --> 19:30.740
0 0 calc for calculation 50 percent minus say 10 pixels or minus once we have this.

19:30.750 --> 19:32.680
This is for the smaller screen.

19:32.760 --> 19:40.570
So I would say this again for our recording let's refresh and let's check it out when we have it on

19:40.590 --> 19:41.280
here.

19:41.340 --> 19:49.030
Now you can see that something didn't happen quite right because this is actually not 50 percent right.

19:49.110 --> 19:50.860
So there's some kind of mistake.

19:51.240 --> 19:54.340
Let me see where maybe I made a mistake.

19:54.730 --> 19:57.560
And this actually should looks correct.

19:57.570 --> 19:57.830
Right.

19:57.830 --> 20:02.580
So you have a 50 percent and minus pixels.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.110
So this is pricing car is fine.

20:05.310 --> 20:12.640
Then for the pricing center you can see that what I messed up is minimum with what I would want is so

20:12.640 --> 20:16.280
and so on six pixels here.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.520
So this all going to refresh.

20:19.670 --> 20:22.590
And I can see that now I have 50 50.

20:22.580 --> 20:24.660
Side by side right.

20:25.060 --> 20:31.290
Here once we have a 50 50 by side by side knowledge's do a media screen here.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.650
Copy and paste this.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.740
And let's do nine and two.

20:35.100 --> 20:35.340
Right.

20:35.340 --> 20:41.640
So we do nine and two we can get rid of all this because this is exactly the same like we had before

20:42.210 --> 20:50.230
and here we're going to say that this is going to be thirty three point three here minus three.

20:50.250 --> 20:58.140
So we're going to say this rush here now is going to be three of them and this is how easy it is to

20:58.140 --> 21:03.840
make a pricing section using a SS flex box.
