There's gonna be some cases where we would like to use special characters in IMO.

00:05.810 --> 00:09.860
So maybe let's look at it how we can work with them and how we can access them.

00:10.310 --> 00:13.190
First and foremost let me get rid of this paragraph.

00:13.190 --> 00:17.600
I'm not going to need it right now as well as let's create a hearing one maybe.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.960
And you know what I didn't want to delete the body.

00:20.150 --> 00:23.330
So let me just uh go back.

00:23.390 --> 00:28.400
Uh here let's say that there is gonna be a ring one and within the heading One will like to use the

00:28.430 --> 00:33.220
copyright special character so I can just write over here copy right.

00:33.230 --> 00:34.570
So some kind of text.

00:34.760 --> 00:38.450
And then how would access the special characters engage him.

00:39.170 --> 00:42.680
Well first of all I would have to access the ampersand sign.

00:42.940 --> 00:49.460
And if you know that you would need to do the shift as well as on my keyboard at least it's above the

00:50.120 --> 00:51.930
number seven on orders.

00:51.950 --> 00:53.880
Now I'm getting my Ampersand sign.

00:54.070 --> 00:57.560
And next I would need to come up with the name that I would be looking for.

00:57.560 --> 01:02.750
So obviously I already know that I'm gonna be looking for copy and check it out.

01:02.750 --> 01:06.350
I would need to write whatever the character I'm looking for.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.740
And then I would like to use the semicolon.

01:09.740 --> 01:16.500
So the moment we're gonna save it I'm gonna have the whatever text I had as well as the special character.

01:16.510 --> 01:21.760
Now you can look for special characters obviously online there's a bunch of tables that give you all

01:21.760 --> 01:22.860
kinds of names.

01:22.900 --> 01:24.520
I'm not gonna go through those tables.

01:24.520 --> 01:28.510
It's really gonna be time consuming and a lot of wasted time.

01:28.510 --> 01:33.190
Just remember that whenever you would be looking for some kind of special character again you can just

01:33.190 --> 01:39.460
google more special characters and that's gonna give you tons and tons of options as you can place it

01:39.490 --> 01:41.180
within your agency email element.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.180
But again the syntax would be exactly the same.

01:44.260 --> 01:45.830
We would have the ampersand again.

01:45.850 --> 01:50.920
We would know some kind of name or number that we're looking for and we would finish off with a semicolon

01:51.310 --> 01:55.900
and then we're gonna have this special character displayed in our HCM I'll document.
