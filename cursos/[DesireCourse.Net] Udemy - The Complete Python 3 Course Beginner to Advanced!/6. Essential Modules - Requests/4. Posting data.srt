1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,710
So far we've been using the requests
package to the extent of getting data,

2

00:00:04,710  -->  00:00:10,620
but what happens if we actually want to
post data? So, when you build an HTML form

3

00:00:10,620  -->  00:00:17,670
there's two types of ways that the form
can submit, basically there's a get and

4

00:00:17,670  -->  00:00:24,060
post. Let's say you have a forum with
name and email address setup, and the

5

00:00:24,060  -->  00:00:31,500
names of each input is name and email. If
you set the form type to get. then

6

00:00:31,500  -->  00:00:35,820
basically what's going to happen is when
you hit submit all of the parameters are

7

00:00:35,820  -->  00:00:40,590
going to be added to the URL similar to
how we did the to get request on Bing

8

00:00:40,590  -->  00:00:46,410
for images last time, or a search query.
So that's a get request, basically they

9

00:00:46,410  -->  00:00:50,640
go into the URL, but a post request
is not shown in the URL so it's

10

00:00:50,640  -->  00:00:55,110
information that's sent in the headers
only. So we can actually use the requests

11

00:00:55,110  -->  00:00:59,520
package to do that. So let's go ahead and
open up

12

00:00:59,520  -->  00:01:05,460
PyCharm here, let's remove this we
actually don't need anything except

13

00:01:05,460  -->  00:01:10,290
requests for this, and let me open up
Safari. So I have found a page that has a

14

00:01:10,290  -->  00:01:18,600
simple form and it posts to I think
itself, does it post to itself? No, it posts to

15

00:01:18,600  -->  00:01:21,810
welcome.php, so this is the URL that we
need.

16

00:01:23,880  -->  00:01:32,909
So let's go ahead and create a request, so 
r = requests.post" So this time we

17

00:01:32,909  -->  00:01:38,040
are not using get, we're using post. Going
to enter the URL here that we want to

18

00:01:38,040  -->  00:01:44,820
post to, and then we're going to add in
the data. So, data is going to be equal to

19

00:01:44,820  -->  00:01:59,939
my data "data=mydata" Let's go ahead and create "my_data = " and I believe that the two inputs

20

00:01:59,939  -->  00:02:04,560
here are named name and email, as my example, they are name and email so let's go

21

00:02:04,560  -->  00:02:07,560
ahead and add a name and email.

22

00:02:11,480  -->  00:02:22,970
So "{"name": "Nick"," and

23

00:02:22,970  -->  00:02:25,970
"email": "nick@example.com"}"

24

00:02:28,220  -->  00:02:32,540
So these are the two variables that
we're gonna be sending in a post format

25

00:02:32,540  -->  00:02:37,940
to this URL which is welcome.php,
and we're actually going to capture the

26

00:02:37,940  -->  00:02:43,879
response so let's go ahead and actually
just save it into, do we have an HTML file?

27

00:02:43,879  -->  00:02:49,430
Let's just save it into an HTML file. So,
let's go ahead and open, actually,

28

00:02:49,430  -->  00:02:59,629
"f = open("myfile.html", "w+")" and "f.write" and we're going to write

29

00:02:59,629  -->  00:03:10,400
"(r.txt)" Let's go ahead and save
this and then run the file, and what

30

00:03:10,400  -->  00:03:15,980
we're going to get is this myfile.html. Now where PHP is rendered on the

31

00:03:15,980  -->  00:03:20,900
server side we should get this page that
says Welcome Nick, Your email address is:

32

00:03:20,900  -->  00:03:28,370
nick@example.co, and that's the same as if we enter that information here, I just cannot

33

00:03:28,370  -->  00:03:33,139
spell my name is today, you'll see that
that's the exact same thing. So that's a

34

00:03:33,139  -->  00:03:37,849
way to post specific data to URL, and
that's going to be useful if you're

35

00:03:37,849  -->  00:03:39,500
working with API's and whatnot.
