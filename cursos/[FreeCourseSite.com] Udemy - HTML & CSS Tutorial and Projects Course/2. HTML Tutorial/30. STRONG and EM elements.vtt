00:00.480 --> 00:01.170
Good.

00:01.170 --> 00:04.090
We know how to use up some elements.

00:04.140 --> 00:08.990
Next let's look at how we can work with strong and emphasise elements.

00:09.170 --> 00:15.210
And we're gonna do the same old spiel where we're gonna create some kind of paragraph and let's say

00:15.210 --> 00:18.720
within the paragraph I'm gonna say I don't know 30 words.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.070
I think that's gonna be more than enough.

00:20.730 --> 00:26.490
And then if I would like to use the strong and M moments most just gonna have to create them somewhere

00:26.490 --> 00:29.680
within this paragraph again they can be really anywhere.

00:29.730 --> 00:34.890
Just make sure if you'd like to have the aim suggestion you need to make like a little bit of space

00:35.340 --> 00:40.620
as you can see if I press spacebar and this is gonna create a space and now I can write whatever element

00:40.650 --> 00:41.930
I would like to have.

00:41.970 --> 00:47.010
So since I'm looking for the strong element this is where I would like to play some text.

00:47.030 --> 00:52.490
I'm gonna I'm just gonna grab whatever text I would like or hear these three words or the whole sentence.

00:52.490 --> 00:53.690
It doesn't really matter.

00:53.850 --> 00:55.660
And the moment we'll get a copy and paste it.

00:56.100 --> 01:01.440
Notice that the text that is within the strong text is bold.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.860
Now let me cover emphasis.

01:02.880 --> 01:08.010
And then we're gonna go a little bit more detail because there's more than meets the eye with these

01:08.010 --> 01:09.170
two elements.

01:09.270 --> 01:14.260
So let's say again we're going to pick some words and then whatever amount of words we would like.

01:14.340 --> 01:15.310
So let's say em.

01:15.360 --> 01:22.290
So I would stand for emphasis and let's say in this case pick a little bit more words and just copy

01:22.360 --> 01:30.150
paste it and sure enough as you can see right now the text that is within the emphasised element is

01:30.150 --> 01:32.640
right now displayed italic.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.290
So it's a little bit slanted.

01:34.290 --> 01:39.900
Now the key with these two elements is like I said there's more than meets the eye because we could

01:39.900 --> 01:43.950
have achieved this simply using the SPSS.

01:44.060 --> 01:49.260
In general you would always prefer to assess just because you want to have all your styles in one place

01:49.680 --> 01:52.860
and serve as an email just for a structure.

01:52.860 --> 01:54.820
You don't want to mix and match them.

01:54.900 --> 02:01.830
Now in this case however is the fact that within the strong and within E M elements being emphasis elements

02:02.550 --> 02:05.280
also help us with accessibility.

02:05.280 --> 02:11.550
So let's say you have a user who is accessing your project with a screen reader then the screen reader

02:11.550 --> 02:13.770
is going to treat this differently.

02:13.860 --> 02:18.740
Let's say whatever is within a strong as well as whatever we have within the emphasis.

02:18.750 --> 02:23.490
So that's always you should keep an eye on wherever you're working with strong and emphasize elements.
