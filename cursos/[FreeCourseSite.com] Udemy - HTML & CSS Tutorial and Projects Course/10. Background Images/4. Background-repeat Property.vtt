WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:05.370
Well since it is hard to dismiss the background the image repeated.

00:05.370 --> 00:10.250
We might as well start with that property and cover the options we have for the values.

00:10.260 --> 00:16.980
But in the process we're also going to touch on something in CSX that is very similar to the last school.

00:17.020 --> 00:19.630
Now remember the last rule would be something like this.

00:19.680 --> 00:24.150
So if I'm going to copy and paste it and if I'm going to say with a div and the height I'm going to

00:24.150 --> 00:28.530
set it to the 200 and let's say color isn't gonna be blue.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.570
What do you think is gonna be displayed.

00:30.570 --> 00:34.100
Do you think the first one or the second one was going to be the second one.

00:34.110 --> 00:35.560
Because this is the last rule.

00:36.090 --> 00:40.720
Well the same works with an order and you'll see what happens here with the property back.

00:40.730 --> 00:41.610
No repeat.

00:41.610 --> 00:43.730
And this is not specific to this property.

00:43.740 --> 00:45.670
This is gonna be happening with all of them.

00:45.760 --> 00:46.260
And you know what.

00:46.260 --> 00:48.120
I might as well show you right now.

00:48.120 --> 00:53.670
So the order is going to work like this that even though let's say I have the height here first or 400

00:54.120 --> 00:57.620
even within the same rule I'm going right here.

00:57.630 --> 00:59.490
Height and two hundred.

00:59.490 --> 01:01.250
What do you think is gonna be displayed.

01:01.320 --> 01:05.520
I think at this moment you already know that this is gonna be two hundred because again the same how

01:05.520 --> 01:07.020
we work with the last rule.

01:07.110 --> 01:08.780
The order also matters.

01:08.780 --> 01:10.800
So if you wrote this first.

01:10.830 --> 01:16.350
This is gonna be displayed but the moment you are going to add the same property with a different value

01:16.770 --> 01:20.600
then obviously this is gonna change because this is gonna be the last in the order.

01:20.700 --> 01:25.710
Again I digress a little bit but I'm gonna be using this as an example so you might as well get used

01:25.710 --> 01:26.460
to it right away.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.110
Okay.

01:28.110 --> 01:31.470
We have a background repeat now what we read the property.

01:31.500 --> 01:36.830
Well surprise surprise this is pretty obvious it will gonna be background repeat.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.990
And that's gonna be the property that will gonna control the repetition of the image.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.160
Now again remember that there's gonna be some things by default.

01:47.160 --> 01:50.590
So if I'm going to write here repeat and then I'm looking for the values.

01:50.650 --> 01:55.490
Notice you're gonna have no repeat repeat repeat x around in space.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.320
So I'm gonna check some of them.

01:57.390 --> 02:01.550
I don't see the point of checking actually all of them but we're gonna start with a very simple one

02:01.570 --> 02:02.700
to repeat.

02:02.700 --> 02:09.030
Now what happens with a repeat on nothing happens when the repeat because it is said by default anyway.

02:09.150 --> 02:12.660
So again something to keep an eye on then the next value.

02:12.690 --> 02:18.000
And this is where the order starts working where I'm not gonna be coming thinking about because I might

02:18.000 --> 02:21.910
as well right the next one because the next one is gonna be affected.

02:21.920 --> 02:26.280
Now in my case I'm going to write not repeat I'm going to use nor repeat.

02:26.310 --> 02:27.210
Check this out.

02:27.210 --> 02:31.130
So what happens now only this image is displayed once.

02:31.170 --> 02:33.060
So if this is hundred by hundred.

02:33.060 --> 02:36.690
Well sorry dude but this is as much as it's going to cover.

02:36.750 --> 02:44.140
Now we can also maybe add some water just to first of all refresh what we already learned so two pixels

02:44.250 --> 02:45.680
solid red.

02:45.720 --> 02:50.260
And the second one just to show you that this is all the space that Dave would have.

02:50.430 --> 02:54.610
But this is how much the background is actually image using.

02:54.650 --> 02:56.120
Okay what do we have next.

02:56.130 --> 02:57.510
We have repeat x.

02:57.520 --> 03:01.210
Now repeat x is just gonna be repeating the image this direction.

03:01.380 --> 03:07.620
And again I know that is kind of hard to see but I will gonna make this bigger the browser window just

03:07.620 --> 03:14.280
to show you that even with the bigger images if the dave is gonna get bigger right now in the x direction

03:14.850 --> 03:19.990
the CSX is gonna repeat the image because as you see there's one image and there's the second one.

03:20.070 --> 03:25.200
Now it was easier to see when the smaller ones because there was 10000 of them but it also is happening

03:25.230 --> 03:26.660
within big images.

03:26.790 --> 03:30.810
So don't think that it's only happening when the small image is by default.

03:30.810 --> 03:36.630
All of them are going to be right away the background repeat and set with the value of repeat what else

03:36.660 --> 03:37.200
we have.

03:37.290 --> 03:39.300
I digress already.

03:39.390 --> 03:39.820
You know what.

03:39.870 --> 03:43.630
I'm just gonna do it simple way to say it then I'm going to repeat this line.

03:43.680 --> 03:51.560
My meaning copy this line and then we're going to repeat x again ten thousand dollars to whoever guesses

03:51.570 --> 03:55.200
this and yes this is gonna be x direction.

03:55.260 --> 03:57.600
So good job whoever you are.

03:57.840 --> 04:01.070
And then we're gonna say y direction again.

04:01.350 --> 04:03.470
Kind of obvious what's gonna be happening.

04:03.540 --> 04:08.170
It's gonna be repeated in the y direction and then we also have the space and round.

04:08.260 --> 04:10.240
So let me copy and paste this.

04:10.270 --> 04:13.460
Let's write space and for the space.

04:13.460 --> 04:18.540
What's gonna happen is that there is gonna be space in between these images can kind of obvious you

04:18.540 --> 04:23.710
can see that there's gonna be space in between whatever images are being repeated.

04:23.880 --> 04:32.070
And the last one is gonna be the round now round is gonna make sure that only round images get in there.

04:32.070 --> 04:33.150
What do I mean by that.

04:33.150 --> 04:39.600
Well if you notice that if you have the repetition if it's not going to be able to fit an image is basically

04:39.600 --> 04:41.310
gonna fit like half an image.

04:41.310 --> 04:45.920
Now in order to show you that let's go to the big one because check this out.

04:45.990 --> 04:52.050
So we have big image but then notice how this is basically like half because not as the basketball post

04:52.410 --> 04:56.360
is going to be right here and then it doesn't cover it completely.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.820
So the hoop doesn't fit in.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.270
Now what do we do here.

05:00.270 --> 05:06.060
Well we're gonna say that we would want to use the same thing that ground.

05:06.090 --> 05:08.910
I okay.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.620
I forgot already.

05:10.680 --> 05:14.810
Background and why I'm typing is background not repeat.

05:14.830 --> 05:17.610
You're looking yeah we are looking for repeat.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.300
What was the value around.

05:19.900 --> 05:24.470
Okay let's start out how this is gonna happen now in this case.

05:24.470 --> 05:25.870
I apologize.

05:25.940 --> 05:30.110
This is gonna fit only one because what happens or I'm sorry too.

05:30.140 --> 05:34.850
So basically by the time it is gonna get bigger if it's gonna be able to fit two then it is gonna fit

05:34.880 --> 05:37.400
nicely to if it's gonna get smaller.

05:37.460 --> 05:39.280
Notice now it's gonna fit only one.

05:39.290 --> 05:44.000
So if I'm gonna get a really big then if there is gonna be space it's gonna fit in.

05:44.000 --> 05:44.350
I don't know.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.020
Let's say three.

05:45.080 --> 05:49.250
But obviously in my case I'm not getting it to three but in the bottom here.

05:49.250 --> 05:50.270
Check this out.

05:50.270 --> 05:55.100
So we have the second image but it is not using the whole thing.

05:55.170 --> 05:57.490
It took an image basically is cut off.

05:57.540 --> 06:02.990
So that's what's happening with the last one which is gonna be again background repeat round.

06:03.050 --> 06:08.630
Now I'm kind of skipping over these ones because in most cases I think you're gonna be using the no

06:08.630 --> 06:10.000
repeat again.

06:10.130 --> 06:15.260
It really matters what you're doing of course again and everything but I think especially in the beginning

06:15.590 --> 06:19.870
you're mostly gonna be focusing on this back on repeat and setting this to no repeat.

06:20.150 --> 06:22.410
I might be wrong but that's just my opinion.
