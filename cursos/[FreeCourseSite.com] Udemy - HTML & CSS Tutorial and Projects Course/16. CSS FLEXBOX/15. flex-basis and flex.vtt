00:00.430 --> 00:04.680
The same way how we have flex girl as well as flex shrink.

00:04.680 --> 00:11.840
We also have flex bases that is responsible for our base value as well as flex property.

00:11.840 --> 00:15.780
That is in fact a shortcut for the first value flex grow.

00:15.870 --> 00:19.730
Then we have flex shrink as well as flex bases.

00:20.130 --> 00:23.240
Now let's start with Flex bases first and foremost.

00:23.250 --> 00:29.290
I'm gonna set up for all the boxes and currently I guess I have four boxes and for all of them I'm going

00:29.290 --> 00:37.510
to set up right now my flex bases so flex bases properly and I'm gonna go 450 pixels.

00:37.590 --> 00:45.810
Now what that means is that flex box can do whatever it wants or I don't want my boxes to be smaller

00:45.810 --> 00:47.630
than hundred and fifty pixels.

00:47.700 --> 00:52.440
However there is a problem right now and the problem is very simple.

00:52.510 --> 00:59.400
We remember when we were setting up these styles CNS we added also a padding and if you notice here

00:59.880 --> 01:05.220
anywhere in my CFS I do have the box sizing to be the border box.

01:05.310 --> 01:12.900
So what happens right now even though I set my boxes to be let's say minimum 150 pixels my padding is

01:12.960 --> 01:18.390
also adding some kind of with to my actual with.

01:18.780 --> 01:23.110
Remember when we did not use the box sizing more box.

01:23.160 --> 01:29.850
In fact if we had some kind of with when we added the padding while the padding was automatically added

01:29.850 --> 01:31.070
to our with.

01:31.410 --> 01:36.510
So that in case actually makes it very difficult to predict your layout.

01:36.510 --> 01:43.260
So once we start working with these base values for sure we need to make sure that box sizing is in

01:43.260 --> 01:45.690
fact set to a broader box.

01:45.770 --> 01:48.030
OK that's case number one.

01:48.150 --> 01:54.450
Now I also want to mention that in general when you are working with a flex box it is not advised to

01:54.450 --> 02:00.570
have padding to left and right at the moment we added padding all around and all that worked out really

02:00.570 --> 02:01.160
well.

02:01.350 --> 02:07.020
But as we're going to be covering right now our Flex bases and how to set up the column layout in fact

02:07.050 --> 02:12.660
I'm going to show you where we're going to run into issues when we have in fact the padding of left

02:12.660 --> 02:13.260
and right.

02:13.260 --> 02:18.810
So we're also going to change this but for the time being what we wanted to do is make sure that once

02:18.810 --> 02:22.040
we have some kind of with let's say 150.

02:22.200 --> 02:27.600
If I had the padding while the padding is not applied to the actual width of the Element.

02:27.610 --> 02:29.730
Okay so that's step number one.

02:29.730 --> 02:30.840
Now again let's go back.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.870
We have our hundred and fifty pixels.

02:32.910 --> 02:33.580
Correct.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.750
That's my basis.

02:34.800 --> 02:40.830
And if I check right now when my layout is changing and by the way at the moment I think I already know

02:40.830 --> 02:46.990
what I'm going to leave the developer tools open but moment as you see I getting smaller smaller I get

02:47.070 --> 02:48.020
the new line.

02:48.240 --> 02:54.120
And if we're going to check out our elements within the container you're going to notice that the size

02:54.210 --> 02:55.460
is hundred fifty.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.660
So the moment are with gets less than half of 50.

02:58.770 --> 03:02.270
That's when we're going to in fact wrap to a new one.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.920
Now what is the reason for wrapping.

03:04.020 --> 03:06.410
Because we're using the Flex ramp right.

03:06.480 --> 03:07.740
That's number one.

03:07.750 --> 03:14.580
Then like I said we also have an option of using the Flex Schalke where instead of typing out flex bases

03:14.580 --> 03:21.720
flex growth lecturing I could type flex the first one is going to be a flex grow property.

03:21.720 --> 03:24.130
And in this case what while you would want.

03:24.270 --> 03:29.320
Well I could go with one correct because by default at zero so the atoms are not growing.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.050
But I would want them to grow.

03:31.050 --> 03:39.300
I'm also gonna set up a flex shrink to be let's say 0 9 because I would want my items not to shrink.

03:39.300 --> 03:44.400
And then of course I could set up my base value and let's imagine that I would like to have my base

03:44.400 --> 03:46.280
value to be 200.

03:46.380 --> 03:48.050
So what is going to happen.

03:48.060 --> 03:52.520
Well if there is going to be enough space course I'm going to have one line.

03:52.680 --> 04:00.870
But then once my boxes get less than two hundred or one of them or all of them it doesn't matter because

04:01.170 --> 04:03.970
as you can see right now I selected them all of them anyway.

04:04.050 --> 04:10.840
Then we're going to wrap into New Line right because we never ever want to go less than 200.

04:10.930 --> 04:11.570
Okay.

04:11.640 --> 04:16.800
That will be the case where we could use the shortcut where I would like my items to grow as much as

04:16.800 --> 04:17.500
possible.

04:17.670 --> 04:19.640
Then I wouldn't want to shrink.

04:19.710 --> 04:25.480
And then of course last if let's say one of my boxes gets less than two hundred.

04:25.590 --> 04:27.340
Well we're going to wrap into new one.

04:27.840 --> 04:34.440
And lastly I'm going to cover how we are gonna be setting up the column layout in our project.

04:34.590 --> 04:35.960
So how it's going to work.

04:36.060 --> 04:38.760
First and foremost I think I can make this smaller.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.010
That's number one.

04:40.170 --> 04:43.360
And then for the column layouts I'm gonna change it around.

04:43.440 --> 04:49.280
But because I wouldn't want in fact my items to grow so growth is gonna be set to zero.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.030
Shrink is gonna be set to zero.

04:51.150 --> 04:56.080
And for the columns we are gonna use in fact a percentage values.

04:56.090 --> 05:00.930
OK not absolute values but percentage values how it's gonna work.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.490
Well let's imagine this scenario.

05:03.630 --> 05:09.370
I have four items right now and I would want to have a four column layout.

05:09.900 --> 05:13.670
So I would need to divide the hundred percent into four correct.

05:13.680 --> 05:19.510
I have four columns so hundred divided by four would be 25 percent.

05:19.650 --> 05:22.300
So I'm gonna add here 25 percent.

05:22.440 --> 05:29.010
However it is not going to be completely correct because once I get a small screen size in fact I'm

05:29.010 --> 05:31.400
gonna be wrapping and I went to a new line.

05:31.410 --> 05:36.450
Now why this is not correct because like I said in fact we're adding padding all around.

05:36.530 --> 05:43.200
So especially when we're setting up the columns it is not very advised to use the padding on left and

05:43.200 --> 05:46.020
right because it is going to mess up your layout.

05:46.350 --> 05:52.980
So instead what I'm gonna do I'm gonna say that 30 pixels is going to be top bottom and then left and

05:52.980 --> 05:55.920
right is going to have a zero padding.

05:55.920 --> 06:01.490
So this way all the time my columns are going to stay this 25 percent.

06:01.830 --> 06:06.930
As you can see the bigger the screen size the bigger the columns smaller the screen size smaller.

06:06.940 --> 06:12.480
This comes when we're not breaking this particular layout because we're not adding some unnecessary

06:12.750 --> 06:15.380
pairings to mess up our land.

06:15.610 --> 06:15.920
All right.

06:16.320 --> 06:23.160
Now lastly I'm gonna cover how in fact we could set up a layout where we have right now our margins

06:23.160 --> 06:23.990
as well in between.

06:24.450 --> 06:29.820
Because we have our columns all that is good but you're probably wondering well how we can have some

06:29.820 --> 06:33.960
margins or essentially some distance in between them.

06:34.320 --> 06:37.920
Now the way it's going to work has the Flex basis value.

06:37.950 --> 06:40.500
We can also use the cost function.

06:40.810 --> 06:47.280
Mean we're in the core function we can pass some kind of values where CSX is going to calculate it.

06:47.310 --> 06:51.700
So we our function and then within the function we are just passing in these values.

06:51.720 --> 06:58.110
So in my case what I would like to pass in is 25 percent and then whatever I would like to have as my

06:58.110 --> 06:58.950
margin.

06:58.950 --> 07:02.430
So I'm going to go with one area but it is really up to you.

07:02.460 --> 07:09.370
Just please please remember when you calculate these values make sure that you have the space in between.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.130
Otherwise not going to work.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.270
Notice it's not going to work.

07:12.270 --> 07:15.010
So make sure that you calculate them correctly.

07:15.030 --> 07:22.740
Now what that gives this is in fact this margin here which technically is not exactly what we want but

07:23.430 --> 07:30.630
remember when we work with the container we also had this option where we can use justify content correct.

07:31.140 --> 07:36.240
So could take justify content and then I can come up with whatever values I wouldn't want.

07:36.420 --> 07:38.950
Do I want them to be space evenly.

07:39.000 --> 07:39.650
Let's try it out.

07:40.140 --> 07:47.080
Now they're spaced evenly we want space between we can do space between and you probably already guessed

07:47.080 --> 07:50.000
that that space around is also going to do the same thing.

07:50.010 --> 07:54.940
So what we're saying here is we're setting up whatever margin we would like.

07:55.500 --> 08:02.750
And then once we have that particular margin well then we can control our items using justified content.

08:02.750 --> 08:02.990
All right.

08:03.390 --> 08:11.100
So those would be the general ideas behind flex bases where that is going to be a base value and it's

08:11.100 --> 08:15.920
most advisable to use some kind of percentages not a pixels for that.

08:15.930 --> 08:22.050
I know I did show you as a pixel example but in most cases you probably want to settle with percentages

08:22.350 --> 08:24.480
because this is going to be a little bit more correct.

08:24.690 --> 08:29.210
And also as a flex while you have multiple options right.

08:29.400 --> 08:33.770
So you can add Lux growth to be one can have a shrink to be one.

08:33.780 --> 08:40.350
It doesn't really matter now in most cases during the project when we're gonna be setting up our columns

08:40.650 --> 08:42.710
this is exactly how we're going to do that.

08:43.130 --> 08:46.270
We're going to set up our Flex be zero.

08:46.380 --> 08:51.960
So they're not going to grow then they're not going to shrink because we would want to control the sizes

08:52.320 --> 08:54.090
using the Flex bases.
