WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:05.290
So how are we're going to have a responsibility here to this number.

00:05.520 --> 00:12.680
So first let's go back to our project and open it up and you can see this is going to be my index page.

00:13.140 --> 00:17.830
So we're going to open up our here and now you can see what's happening right now.

00:17.860 --> 00:20.100
Are these all the time going to be like this.

00:20.100 --> 00:20.660
Right.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.790
And this is something that we don't want.

00:22.920 --> 00:28.290
We actually want as the screen gets bigger the links are displayed here in line.

00:28.350 --> 00:34.540
So when we're going to do or here we're going to go back and we're going at a mini equerry So we're

00:34.540 --> 00:43.050
going to go back over here and we're going to say media here and we're going to see a screen screen

00:43.050 --> 00:43.570
like this.

00:43.570 --> 00:47.150
And I'm going to say and I know here we're going to say men and where.

00:47.210 --> 00:53.190
So basically we need to pick the size so I'm going to say men with no hair are going to say that once

00:53.190 --> 00:57.150
it gets to six hundred ninety pixels something should happen.

00:57.250 --> 01:02.710
All right so once the screen size gets two hundred sixty nine sixty nine pixels.

01:02.840 --> 01:09.690
So we're here first thing we're going to say for the nav display and I'm going to say flex here then

01:09.700 --> 01:14.490
we're going to have a line items baseline and flex rap rap.

01:14.650 --> 01:18.270
But let's just go back over here first let's see how this one looks like.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.490
So if I refresh.

01:19.710 --> 01:22.780
You can see that right now were actually displayed.

01:22.870 --> 01:23.450
All right.

01:23.520 --> 01:25.160
And this play flex.

01:25.460 --> 01:31.750
Then over here we're going to say a line items like this and I'm going to say baseline.

01:32.250 --> 01:40.320
I'm going to say baseline on here then I'm going to say flex wrap here flex wrap and I'm going to say

01:40.790 --> 01:46.990
wrap this and then we're going to have a padding of 0 and 20 pixels.

01:47.010 --> 01:52.230
So here what I'm saying is that I'll line them right because these are going to be different values

01:52.710 --> 01:56.260
the coding and the links are actually going to be displayed differently.

01:56.290 --> 02:02.900
Right now we can see this right now because we haven't said this one was to display flex right.

02:02.930 --> 02:07.920
But when there are going to be a line you can see that these guys are actually smaller than this.

02:07.980 --> 02:12.460
So when we say Auline center right a line item is baseline.

02:12.480 --> 02:19.200
What I'm saying is line these guys over here right according to where the text is and not where the

02:19.200 --> 02:21.370
actual value of the boxes.

02:21.390 --> 02:26.510
So now that we have for the now let's keep going here next one we're going to say for the menu.

02:26.530 --> 02:30.350
But what we're going to say we're here a menu between.

02:30.410 --> 02:32.820
We're going to say display none.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.140
So I'm going to say display none.

02:34.140 --> 02:39.620
So what's happening is for the bigger screen I actually don't want this button and because I want just

02:39.630 --> 02:46.970
decoding and the links so we keep on going here and then we're going to have an ordered list.

02:47.280 --> 02:54.780
So I'm going to say Now first we have on our list and here we're going to say this is going to be a

02:55.160 --> 02:57.160
full X more here.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.540
We're going to say this is going to be one.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.330
And it's going to be one.

03:01.530 --> 03:03.110
And this is going to be harder.

03:03.300 --> 03:10.590
So basically what I'm saying here is not I would want this one and this one I can see they're expanding

03:10.590 --> 03:16.800
all across right because I wanted to take the whole space right not individual length but actually the

03:16.800 --> 03:18.550
whole $100.

03:18.570 --> 03:21.080
So here we have flex 1 1.

03:21.180 --> 03:29.130
Then after that we're going to have a play here and we're going to say flex here like this.

03:29.280 --> 03:34.380
And then what's going to happen is I'm going right and this is going to be important because I'm going

03:34.380 --> 03:37.720
to show you why we actually need to add important or here right.

03:37.830 --> 03:43.000
Because I don't want it right right now and then for you to think that you don't understand why I did

03:43.010 --> 03:43.240
that.

03:43.250 --> 03:47.210
So this is going to be flex wrap and we're going to say.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.800
And let's again let's go and check it out.

03:49.980 --> 03:53.260
And once we refresh now we can see that first of all.

03:53.270 --> 03:53.830
All right.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.470
They are displayed in one line.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.010
Right.

03:56.130 --> 04:02.390
And for the Flex wrap what's happening is as I'm going on here right you can see that over here.

04:02.550 --> 04:08.110
Once it's going to start getting the new line right it's actually going to go right again.

04:08.220 --> 04:12.300
We're going to get rid of this annoying transition right because you can see on the big screen doesn't

04:12.300 --> 04:13.450
look that great right.

04:13.680 --> 04:20.990
So as you can see or hear as it was smaller right now the button is actually showing and disappears.

04:21.330 --> 04:27.480
Now over here what you would want is for the list item and for a list item I'm going to say now have

04:28.290 --> 04:30.260
on our list a list item.

04:30.480 --> 04:35.850
And since this is actually display flexed right the whole on the list.

04:35.850 --> 04:37.800
All right well we need to do over here.

04:37.800 --> 04:44.820
We're going to say this is going to be flex and this is going to be flex grow one flex shrink zero and

04:45.200 --> 04:48.700
25 pixels on this.

04:48.780 --> 04:51.960
So we save this and over here you will see the difference.

04:51.960 --> 04:52.570
Right.

04:52.590 --> 04:54.550
So as we go to the bigger screen.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.690
This is the flex ramp.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.420
So what's happening is now they're all 25.

04:59.430 --> 05:06.360
You can see that side by side because we had a flex grow more here and as we're actually going on here

05:06.360 --> 05:09.050
like this right you can see what's happening right.

05:09.180 --> 05:12.460
The text is not going somewhere in sexually rapping the next line.

05:12.480 --> 05:19.680
That's where the flex rap comes in here and once we hit this screen right now I can see the button appears

05:20.160 --> 05:23.310
and button actually disappears.

05:23.640 --> 05:29.660
Now the issue is with this screen or hearing let's say or here that we click disappearing.

05:29.670 --> 05:30.360
Right.

05:30.450 --> 05:34.970
And if we go back over here you can see that our links actually disappeared also.

05:35.070 --> 05:42.300
Therefore if you're working with the links right with us on our list you need to right over here important

05:43.380 --> 05:45.990
important here.

05:46.020 --> 05:50.610
And then once we say this once we refresh now I can see that there are going to be back again right

05:50.970 --> 05:56.400
because as you're toggling with the button if you're going to click it on here and disappears right.

05:56.520 --> 05:59.690
If you're not going to have that important those links are actually going to disappear.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.540
Right now they're showing.

06:01.560 --> 06:01.760
Right.

06:01.770 --> 06:08.040
Because we wrote over here this important display flex and this is going to be important now that we're

06:08.280 --> 06:09.380
done with this.

06:09.380 --> 06:11.320
Let's work with this little icon.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.140
This one over here.

06:13.470 --> 06:18.950
And actually you know what let's get rid of this home because we don't really need that.

06:18.990 --> 06:24.020
So we're going to say we're here is all this is going to get rid of this guy.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.280
You know this animal is going to leave this icon.

06:27.540 --> 06:29.020
So we're going to say this.

06:29.120 --> 06:35.230
And for the main assessment we're going to say that for the icon we would want what we would want now

06:35.240 --> 06:45.510
very well here and Dot icon here and then I can we're going to say flex this is going to be 0 0 and

06:45.510 --> 06:46.440
20 pixels.

06:46.440 --> 06:51.180
And then once we read or hear for this icon and then we can go back over here you can see that nothing

06:51.180 --> 06:51.690
changed.

06:51.690 --> 06:52.300
Right.

06:52.320 --> 06:58.120
And the reason for that in this class class needs to be placed in the list item.

06:58.200 --> 06:58.540
Right.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.870
Because you can see the actual link.

07:00.940 --> 07:01.850
All right.

07:01.890 --> 07:05.210
This is not a direct child or a flex parent.

07:05.220 --> 07:10.770
So the right or here we're going to say that this is going to be class know know going to say I can

07:11.390 --> 07:18.100
here once we say this like this now I can see that this one actually is just going to take 20 or more

07:18.140 --> 07:18.870
pixels.

07:18.930 --> 07:23.880
Now again we still have this little bit of annoying transition all right which was led from the smaller

07:23.880 --> 07:24.620
screen right.

07:24.690 --> 07:27.740
But you can see that right away the size actually got smaller.

07:27.810 --> 07:32.800
So if you're going to go back to a main see this and we're going to keep on styling.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.950
Now after that we would want to style the actual nav link icon.

07:37.200 --> 07:44.550
So we're going to say we're here now have you all on here ally and we're going to say link icon here

07:44.760 --> 07:45.580
in this.

07:45.780 --> 07:50.340
And they're all going to say this is going to be a color and we're going to say the color is going to

07:50.340 --> 07:50.940
be hashed.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.300
F5 F5 F5.

07:53.490 --> 07:54.320
Really miss.

07:54.540 --> 08:01.810
And then we're going to have a background and the Madrona is going to be hashtag 3 9 5 3 9 5 and then

08:01.820 --> 08:05.420
we're going to have e 7 e e 7.

08:05.550 --> 08:06.630
Or here.

08:06.660 --> 08:11.980
Then after that we would want once we're hovering right so we're going to call Mac or hear what to say

08:11.980 --> 08:12.500
now.

08:12.720 --> 08:21.510
Well I don't want to say a link where I can I'm going to say however now once we're hovering you'd want

08:21.570 --> 08:24.870
a background and the background should be like this.

08:24.870 --> 08:25.440
Right.

08:25.440 --> 08:30.000
So I'm saying this is hashtag 0 0 8.

08:30.190 --> 08:34.050
They're going to have here a D.

08:34.410 --> 08:34.970
Right.

08:34.980 --> 08:36.960
So let's go back over here again.

08:37.630 --> 08:39.270
Fresh right you can see that right away.

08:39.270 --> 08:40.210
Background changed.

08:40.230 --> 08:40.800
Right.

08:40.800 --> 08:44.370
And as I'm hovering you can see the values are changing.

08:44.370 --> 08:50.670
Now we're here we're here right so not because this is going to be white guys over here are going to

08:50.670 --> 08:52.470
be a background.

08:52.520 --> 08:52.750
Right.

08:52.770 --> 08:55.990
And as I changed here this would be like this.

08:56.190 --> 09:01.560
Now then after that what we would want is we would want to actually work with a link.

09:01.550 --> 09:09.960
So I'm going to say now here and then I'm say this is going to be on our list link and then I'm going

09:09.960 --> 09:17.310
to say this is going to be text align center on this so we're actually placing them in the center.

09:17.340 --> 09:19.560
But again this is not happening on a small screen.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.890
This is actually happening on a bigger one.

09:22.110 --> 09:24.130
And then we're going to have for the hovering.

09:24.420 --> 09:27.420
So what we're going to say for the hovering of we're going to see it like this.

09:27.560 --> 09:30.460
We're going to say this is going to be Nav. on here.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.910
Well or here.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.880
We're on this.

09:35.910 --> 09:44.380
And then we're going to say padding ten pixels or here and we're going to say important important over

09:44.430 --> 09:44.950
here.

09:45.240 --> 09:51.210
And basically what I'm doing here if you go back all the way to the top when we were actually working

09:51.210 --> 09:52.180
with this one right.

09:52.340 --> 09:57.620
I remember when we had a hover effect over here for our links right.

09:57.630 --> 10:02.960
Remember we had little change in padding left to 60 but you can see that the original was basically

10:02.960 --> 10:03.790
10.

10:03.800 --> 10:08.690
So what I'm saying here with the smaller screen this is all I'm saying I'm saying listen just leave

10:08.690 --> 10:10.860
the padding the way it is originally.

10:10.910 --> 10:15.790
So for a refresher here you can see that the only thing is changing is background and color.

10:15.860 --> 10:17.980
However the padding is not changing.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.010
So this is how it's going to look like.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.670
And then as we're going in the smaller screen right you can see what's happening.

10:23.810 --> 10:30.030
First of all we have all here and this flex Grall one flex shrink here zero.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.210
So they don't shrink but they grow.

10:32.240 --> 10:36.310
However as I'm rapping you can see they're wrapping in the next line right.

10:36.530 --> 10:41.880
The moment there is not enough space in the screen perhaps the next line wraps to the next line.

10:41.890 --> 10:42.290
Right.

10:42.410 --> 10:45.370
And therefore we were using these flex wrap or here right.

10:45.620 --> 10:49.450
Oh here we have the button or here right which we can actually.

10:49.490 --> 10:49.970
Right.

10:50.150 --> 10:54.740
And you can see that we don't have an issue anymore once we had the links go back over here and they

10:54.740 --> 10:55.730
still are here.

10:55.790 --> 10:56.420
Right.

10:56.510 --> 11:01.780
And then after that the last thing they really want to do is actually padding over here for this Naphtali.

11:02.090 --> 11:08.430
So what I'm going to say or here last through here is going to be hashtag Nav. top.

11:08.630 --> 11:14.840
I'm going to say padding and this is going to be 10 pixels or here and then I would say this.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.950
And you can see or hear what happens right.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.100
So now we have a little bit less padding.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.550
So this is going to be a little bit higher.

11:21.650 --> 11:27.680
And if we go back over here now we're actually done with our nav bar and we're ready to go ahead and

11:27.680 --> 11:34.940
start styling or here this Vanner with coding and coding attic meets successful X-Box.
