WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:06.270
That we're done with setting up a title you can actually go ahead and finish your here with the skills

00:06.270 --> 00:07.200
section.

00:07.200 --> 00:11.420
So what I'm going to do we're here again we're going to homework and this is going to be in the title

00:11.430 --> 00:12.100
right.

00:12.110 --> 00:13.940
So this is going to be the end of title.

00:14.070 --> 00:19.170
And now we're going to create a comment here I'm going to say this is going to be a div with a class

00:19.230 --> 00:26.880
of skills Center press table here and when then there's going to have a article here.

00:27.080 --> 00:32.660
Not meaning for class this is going to be skill or here don't open it up.

00:32.910 --> 00:39.710
And then we're going to have a font or some sort here I'm just going to say this is going to be a this

00:39.740 --> 00:47.160
is going to be f a apple press time or you know like this and we're going to have a heading three and

00:47.160 --> 00:51.360
heading three isn't going to be or you know like this and I was going to say this is going to be Apple

00:52.020 --> 00:52.950
press time.

00:52.990 --> 00:57.570
Now this is going to be the next one and they're all going to have a paragraph or here we're going to

00:57.570 --> 01:02.030
see a paragraph over here let's say we're going to have like let's say 10 words.

01:02.060 --> 01:04.920
Right so we're on 10 or you're right.

01:04.980 --> 01:07.160
So we can have a paragraph.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.040
And this is going to be the text.

01:09.060 --> 01:12.030
Now what would you want to do is actually just copy and paste this.

01:12.040 --> 01:12.380
Right.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.740
So we have an article right.

01:14.850 --> 01:19.080
So I'm going to be selecting the lines here and all this is going to have three more.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.510
One two three.

01:20.670 --> 01:26.450
No one here would just need to make obviously few changes with the first one is going to be ample.

01:26.460 --> 01:28.930
Second it going to be let's say Google.

01:29.280 --> 01:35.400
And so what we're saying is that we can work with an apple and with Google and we also can do Android

01:36.670 --> 01:38.970
Android on Agnes.

01:39.070 --> 01:41.270
And the last one is going to be here.

01:41.350 --> 01:44.380
So basically we're good with any tool whatsoever.

01:44.380 --> 01:47.720
So I'm going to say gear on here and this.

01:47.720 --> 01:50.100
Now we have a clear knowledge changer here.

01:50.110 --> 01:58.050
This is going to be tools here than the next one is going to be Android Android here.

01:58.300 --> 02:03.540
And then this is going to be Google and this is going to be it for the AGM now.

02:03.760 --> 02:09.420
So what would you want to do is we would want to actually save this and let's go and actually deal with

02:09.420 --> 02:10.790
the main CSSA.

02:11.150 --> 02:13.390
So we're here for the skill.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.170
All right.

02:14.170 --> 02:18.540
First of all who would want to do is again create a new one right now.

02:18.650 --> 02:19.880
Coming over here.

02:20.060 --> 02:21.460
I'm going to say skills.

02:21.610 --> 02:25.240
And another one again are going to create some hashtags.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.820
And again we're going to make a lot of room here right.

02:27.860 --> 02:33.460
But over here we're first thing that I would want to do just for new skills here are we want to push

02:33.460 --> 02:35.690
it up a bit in the title.

02:35.740 --> 02:39.600
So I'm going to say we're here hashtags kills here.

02:39.720 --> 02:44.130
I don't know where I'm going to say margin and margin up.

02:44.190 --> 02:47.670
This is going to be negative 40 pixels.

02:47.680 --> 02:52.980
Right so here you can see that I basically lifted a text up or like this and this is what I want to

02:53.110 --> 02:54.880
do just for this title.

02:55.300 --> 03:00.820
And then after that what I would want to say is for that div That's a parent element for a lot them

03:00.820 --> 03:02.790
right for the skill center.

03:02.790 --> 03:04.150
I don't want to say it like this right.

03:04.150 --> 03:14.500
I'm going to say skills center like this and then I have a max with all this I'm going to say Max with

03:15.090 --> 03:18.900
90 you with us or here like this right.

03:18.950 --> 03:21.550
So I can see what's happening right around 90.

03:21.670 --> 03:23.490
But everything shifts there's a lot.

03:23.810 --> 03:29.640
Then we're going to margin 0 0 0 on handling this zero.

03:29.990 --> 03:34.170
And then we have a padding all around so 20 pixels and zero.

03:34.340 --> 03:38.160
So what I'm saying top bottom 20 pixels and zero on the sides.

03:38.170 --> 03:38.320
Right.

03:38.330 --> 03:43.700
Because we are already using a 90 you with or here or here.

03:43.700 --> 03:48.330
So let's place a somewhere call and order here.

03:48.460 --> 03:52.110
The next thing that I would want to do is deal with the actual individual skill.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.770
So I'm going to say we're here again.

03:53.800 --> 04:00.130
Let's create a lot of room and we're going to have a dot and that is going to be for the skill.

04:00.280 --> 04:07.390
So skill not here we're going to say margin 40 pixels right so you can see that now is going on around

04:07.620 --> 04:08.220
zero.

04:08.410 --> 04:13.350
So what I want is actually in between them 40 pixels and this is going to work for all the screens right

04:13.360 --> 04:15.100
starting from the smallest one right.

04:15.280 --> 04:19.810
But as the screen is going to get bigger it's still going to be staying with 40 pixels.

04:19.930 --> 04:23.740
Now after that we would deal with the actual front awesome icons.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.340
So this is going to be skill more here.

04:26.380 --> 04:26.770
Font.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.680
Awesome.

04:27.940 --> 04:29.160
I really like this.

04:29.170 --> 04:34.200
And then we're going to have a font size 16 pixels here right.

04:34.300 --> 04:41.230
I know WAY bigger color and the color is going to be hash tag 0 0 0 a.

04:41.500 --> 04:45.720
And then we'll have 7 E and one on here.

04:45.850 --> 04:46.120
Right.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.670
The blue color all the way.

04:47.830 --> 04:52.610
That was actually all right and the blue color all from here.

04:52.630 --> 04:57.170
Then after that all we would want is actually have a background.

04:57.550 --> 04:57.740
Right.

04:57.760 --> 05:03.430
So I'm going to say a background and the background is going to be hash that f f o.

05:03.610 --> 05:11.620
See 9 1 4 and 2 and basically we're adding red as yellow color and then what we would want is actually

05:11.770 --> 05:18.290
a padded room because this is if we had a franÃ§aise we also need the padding.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.620
60 pixels.

05:19.730 --> 05:20.250
All right.

05:20.350 --> 05:24.000
So you can think of this is this is going to be kind of like our canvas.

05:24.030 --> 05:28.150
Again we're going to be clipping out the shapes on this right.

05:28.360 --> 05:34.530
So let's go over here and we're going to say let's say this is going to be skills for and then we'll

05:34.540 --> 05:39.520
have a transition and it's all going to we're going to have a transition and transition again is going

05:39.520 --> 05:42.110
to be for that color for the background.

05:42.270 --> 05:43.780
Let's say two seconds.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.730
Ease and background.

05:46.590 --> 05:53.790
Background here say two seconds two seconds is more like this.

05:53.820 --> 05:59.610
And once we have them we're going to go back or here skill we're going to say Fronto awesome.

05:59.890 --> 06:02.400
I'm going to say however we're like this.

06:02.670 --> 06:05.880
And then we're going to flip them around so I'm going to say background.

06:05.940 --> 06:10.640
It's going to be hash tag to me too.

06:10.860 --> 06:14.160
Hate to here like this.

06:14.370 --> 06:17.470
And then we're going to have a caller and the caller is going to be here.

06:17.490 --> 06:22.650
And so hashtag ever see 9 1 for all here.

06:22.820 --> 06:24.110
So we're here.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.280
I can see what happens right.

06:25.290 --> 06:27.990
We get a black background right here.

06:28.060 --> 06:29.660
The color is also changing.

06:30.060 --> 06:31.560
Obviously not done yet.

06:31.590 --> 06:32.200
Right.

06:32.280 --> 06:38.250
We still need to work here with a Adding three and a paragraph.

06:38.450 --> 06:44.610
So what we're going to do we're here and we're going to create a lot more space like this and then we're

06:44.610 --> 06:49.980
going to start or we're all going to say this is going to be skill and I'm going to say we're here this

06:49.980 --> 06:58.440
is going to be heading 3 so we'll have a hearing three and I will say text transform and we're going

06:58.440 --> 06:59.790
to say Asperger's.

06:59.890 --> 07:07.280
So now this setting frees up uppercase and we have a margin 20 pixels right and zero.

07:07.280 --> 07:13.130
All right so again we're just going to create the margin here and then we're going to have for a paragraph.

07:13.320 --> 07:19.860
So here we're going to say skill paragraph and let's start with line height 1.5 right over here and

07:19.870 --> 07:24.360
we're just going to create some letters and then I would want to do is actually have the width and you

07:24.360 --> 07:26.530
can see I don't like that it's padding like this.

07:26.780 --> 07:30.550
So I'm going to say we're here I'm going to have a semi colon.

07:30.670 --> 07:36.120
It's going to be with oh here we're going to say 70 percent on here like this.

07:36.130 --> 07:36.600
All right.

07:36.720 --> 07:42.720
So now we're here you can see that we have a normal with right not spanning all across.

07:42.720 --> 07:49.300
And then after that we would want a cover that color Steg be on 5.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.960
See this.

07:51.060 --> 07:54.420
And then we have to be 7 to be seven.

07:54.420 --> 07:57.750
All right so this is pretty much going to be great text.

07:57.780 --> 08:04.170
Now I would would want to do is you'd want actually to have a clip path for all of them.

08:04.170 --> 08:04.710
All right.

08:04.800 --> 08:11.350
So let's go one by one and let's actually at it so first is going to be Apple and someone to say apple.

08:11.400 --> 08:15.810
So this is Fonte awesome Apple like this and you can see that it's selecting.

08:15.950 --> 08:18.360
And let me do a clip.

08:18.360 --> 08:22.600
I have one here and I'm going to do polygon here like this.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.230
All right.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.470
Well I don't know.

08:24.500 --> 08:29.290
Here we need to have three dots right so we read first one second and third one.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.890
So the word is this one with the Y.

08:32.070 --> 08:37.570
All right you can see the Y is zero here and 100 here right where is X.

08:37.590 --> 08:38.910
X is zero here.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.650
Hundred here right.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.700
And basically we start working with these dots.

08:42.930 --> 08:47.790
So first what I'm saying is you know what I'm going to start from here which is going to be 0 x and

08:47.790 --> 08:48.950
100 percent y.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.740
So we're at zero hundred percent.

08:52.170 --> 08:55.330
This next one is going to be over here in the middle.

08:55.380 --> 08:58.730
So this is going to be 50 percent and y is going to be zero.

08:58.860 --> 09:06.420
And because it's going to be all the way on the top some would say 50 percent and zero or place in doubt.

09:06.510 --> 09:10.480
And I said that over here and the next one is going to be here so it's going to be hundred.

09:10.600 --> 09:14.990
And we're also hundred and so existe hundred and the that.

09:15.190 --> 09:20.200
So I'm going to say hundred and hundred like this negative.

09:20.230 --> 09:22.130
Now I have a nice try.

09:22.130 --> 09:28.280
All right now we're done with an apple and we actually will going to add two more.

09:28.430 --> 09:32.870
And then the third one start when you are actually going and getting online because I don't want to

09:32.870 --> 09:35.800
make like a whole hour of actually making a star.

09:35.810 --> 09:39.940
Now we can do it but this is just going to be faster.

09:39.940 --> 09:41.540
All right so we're here we're going to change.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.040
First of all for these guys right.

09:43.280 --> 09:51.040
So I would say this is going to be Google or here let's say that this is going to be Android and maybe

09:51.040 --> 09:54.700
copy this one because the only thing we're missing is that rule.

09:54.790 --> 09:57.910
So I'm going to say we're here and this is going to be here.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.400
So I'm going to say here or here.

10:00.400 --> 10:00.710
All right.

10:00.730 --> 10:02.190
All of them all right and I'll try.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.920
But that's not what we want.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.790
So let's go ahead and are going to this.

10:07.840 --> 10:12.550
We're here we're going to delete this and we're here we're going to delete the whole thing because we're

10:12.550 --> 10:17.530
going to copy and paste one on here so we're here for the Google what we would want.

10:17.530 --> 10:20.560
All right so let's check it out right all here.

10:20.590 --> 10:25.490
Zero zero hundred zero hundred hundred.

10:25.600 --> 10:25.990
We're here.

10:25.990 --> 10:28.790
So it's pretty much kind of the same as this.

10:28.990 --> 10:35.680
So we're going to go back over here and we're going to say 0 0 then we're going to have a hundred here

10:35.800 --> 10:43.580
and zero on here like this then we're going to have a hundred and hundred right over here like this.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.160
You can see what we have right.

10:45.210 --> 10:48.690
This is the first not second not third or here.

10:48.690 --> 10:53.230
Right now we just need to figure out or here and we can really do whatever we want right.

10:53.250 --> 10:56.920
So I'm going to go 0 60 or like this right.

10:56.950 --> 10:59.340
So now I can see that this is going to be this way.

10:59.370 --> 11:02.020
All right then the next one is going to be Android.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.910
Right and what is the shape over here and shape is going to be this one.

11:06.090 --> 11:07.700
So this is going to be an android.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.310
So I'm going to go back over here.

11:09.580 --> 11:12.520
And for Android we're going to start in the middle over here.

11:12.550 --> 11:14.280
So I'm going to say zero for X.

11:14.440 --> 11:21.720
But already 50 percent for Y then we're going to have a 50 percent and zero.

11:21.730 --> 11:30.430
So 50 percent and zero and after that we're going to have a 100 percent here 50 percent right.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.550
Now again you can see that we have three dots.

11:32.770 --> 11:34.700
Now we just need this guy here.

11:35.080 --> 11:40.000
So we're going to say we're 50 percent here and 100 percent.

11:40.110 --> 11:40.970
That's it.

11:41.150 --> 11:42.570
No no we're here with the ship.

11:42.990 --> 11:45.780
So now let's go and get actually the star.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.630
All right so this is going to be 900.

11:47.690 --> 11:48.880
We need to start over here.

11:48.900 --> 11:49.630
Right.

11:49.720 --> 11:55.070
And we're going to we're going to go to good old friend Google mistake clip path we're going to set

11:55.080 --> 11:56.430
generator.

11:57.000 --> 11:57.580
Yes.

11:57.840 --> 12:02.780
And then there is more here a clip path maker right on this.

12:02.910 --> 12:06.560
And what we would need to do or here we can just go ahead and choose goshi.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.000
Again you can pick whatever you would really like.

12:09.000 --> 12:09.530
Right.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.000
You can see that this was the triangle that regret over here.

12:13.000 --> 12:13.510
Right.

12:13.710 --> 12:14.920
But we're going to go back over here.

12:14.930 --> 12:16.070
We're going to get a star.

12:16.260 --> 12:19.830
And you see this is the actual browser prefixes right.

12:19.830 --> 12:22.070
And then there are prefixes that I was talking about right.

12:22.070 --> 12:24.370
So here this is going to be Webcke right.

12:24.450 --> 12:30.270
And I was like I said I didn't want to write them all right because this is not going to make too much
