WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:00.770
Awesome.

00:00.780 --> 00:07.280
Before we start working hard on our project why don't we take a look at the amazing snippets the iMac

00:07.330 --> 00:09.780
provides to speed up our workflow.

00:09.990 --> 00:15.510
Because at the moment we have been using only one thing which is basically to generate the tax.

00:15.630 --> 00:16.920
Reached him tax.

00:17.220 --> 00:21.880
Well if any of you have missed that we have been using them at all along.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.930
Or maybe you are not using the visual studio code.

00:25.110 --> 00:30.140
If we're gonna head over again to the browser and if I'm gonna type Emmet if you don't have the.

00:30.300 --> 00:36.240
Meaning if you're not using the visual studio code because if you are using Visual Studio code this

00:36.240 --> 00:39.090
is gonna be built in right there in a visual studio code.

00:39.490 --> 00:46.110
However if you're not you can go always here to their documentation and download and add it to your

00:46.110 --> 00:51.030
actual text that not there is probably also gonna be an option for you to use some kind of extension

00:51.540 --> 00:54.120
that might be another out that you would want to use.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.530
And if you'd want to I don't know.

00:56.610 --> 01:04.110
Explore more Emmet snippets that we're gonna be working on and you can head over to their documentation.

01:04.110 --> 01:11.370
And like I said in general we have been using only one Emmett suggestion where we are just getting our

01:11.370 --> 01:15.700
tags meaning as we're working with a CSX.

01:15.810 --> 01:21.830
They were also giving real suggestions and as a side note if you'd ever want to get the suggestion so

01:21.840 --> 01:27.030
let's say I'm gonna type a dot type something so this would be my class but then I press the spacebar

01:27.450 --> 01:32.900
and I would still want to get the m a suggestion in the CSX is gonna work exactly the same way.

01:32.940 --> 01:37.410
If you're gonna press control and spacebar you're gonna get a suggestion.

01:37.410 --> 01:43.440
Like I said already before the only thing we're gonna make have been covering so far has been creating

01:43.440 --> 01:49.680
tags where we just press whatever name of the tag and we are creating a war as we're working with them

01:49.680 --> 01:52.160
and we have far more options than that.

01:52.170 --> 01:53.370
Now what would be the first one.

01:53.370 --> 01:58.440
Well let's say that there's going to be a heading however this heading one is gonna have right away

01:58.440 --> 01:58.970
a class.

01:59.190 --> 02:00.150
So how will you do that.

02:00.660 --> 02:02.880
Well enamored we just need to type dot.

02:03.020 --> 02:04.920
And now we can start adding the classes.

02:05.100 --> 02:08.370
So let's say here I'm gonna say main on this would be the main class.

02:08.370 --> 02:09.210
And you know what.

02:09.450 --> 02:13.440
If you think that you'll need more classes you just need to keep typing that.

02:13.650 --> 02:17.630
And the class name so let's say secondary then whatever big.

02:17.630 --> 02:18.720
And then something else.

02:18.720 --> 02:24.230
So what you're gonna have at the end is a heading one with all these three classes.

02:24.480 --> 02:25.680
So far so good.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.870
Now we also have an option of working with ideas the same way so I can say here having one.

02:30.870 --> 02:32.760
And again we will do the same thing.

02:32.970 --> 02:39.360
And then the hash tag and then I devalue again we can use the same one and we're gonna be getting the

02:39.480 --> 02:41.800
heading One with ideas of Main.

02:41.970 --> 02:48.120
As you already saw it before with the classes and with an I.D. we can put together and obviously we

02:48.120 --> 02:49.290
can combine them.

02:49.350 --> 02:55.980
So if there's gonna be heading three that's gonna have the idea of third class of third can write something

02:55.980 --> 02:58.310
like this and we're gonna be getting our heading three.

02:58.620 --> 03:03.750
We had some kind of text and this is something that you're gonna see me a lot doing throughout the project

03:04.170 --> 03:08.800
where I'm just gonna come up with let's say some kind of name so this is gonna be our NAV bar.

03:08.910 --> 03:14.760
I'm sorry that's not going to be a simple tag but let's say we're gonna be typing header now the header

03:14.760 --> 03:21.000
would have some kind of class so let's say there's gonna be a header and if you'd want to add another

03:21.000 --> 03:26.490
class I don't know main or something like this then we're just getting in the header and this is tremendously

03:26.490 --> 03:32.820
again speed up your workflow where you're gonna find it really annoying typing uranium all tags and

03:32.820 --> 03:37.430
then later on going and adding classes already so far so good.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.850
So what else we're having.

03:38.850 --> 03:45.510
Well we can create right away divs we can I.D. And we as a class as well.

03:45.510 --> 03:49.040
Now we already know that we can just type the element and then whatever.

03:49.080 --> 03:52.680
However with this we have a little bit faster way.

03:52.800 --> 03:57.040
So we know that there's gonna be data we can just type whatever we're all going to be adding what is

03:57.050 --> 03:57.310
this.

03:57.750 --> 04:02.880
So this case let's say that there's gonna be a div with an idea of box and then with the classes of

04:02.880 --> 04:07.800
box number one box number two and so on so forth.

04:07.800 --> 04:14.120
What I'm having right away is the div and I have right away the I.D. as well as the classes.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.940
Mark what else we have.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.320
Well we can create children within now.

04:18.750 --> 04:24.900
So let's say I'm going to be looking for a div that will gonna have the list item within the.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.990
On our list so I can say like this.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.220
And then if we use the angle bracket that means that now we're gonna be creating children and we're

04:32.220 --> 04:36.690
not limited to on our list or lists and I'm just using this as an example.

04:36.690 --> 04:37.500
So I can say you know what.

04:37.510 --> 04:41.250
There's gonna be a on her list with a list item.

04:41.370 --> 04:43.220
How are your question would be.

04:43.230 --> 04:47.960
Well usually when we create on our lists we create multiple elements.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.340
Don't worry I got you covered.

04:50.370 --> 04:57.120
So again we can do the same thing where we say dev on a list and list item and let's come up with our

04:57.120 --> 04:59.400
list items 1 1 1 5.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.810
We can just and here this multiplication and just say five.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.170
So this is gonna create five of them.

05:06.200 --> 05:13.040
And right away we have the div on her list and whatever list items we wanted or while we can also place

05:13.040 --> 05:15.190
a text within the element.

05:15.470 --> 05:20.310
So let's say all gonna have some kind of paragraph and within the paragraph we're gonna write some creative

05:20.330 --> 05:22.400
texts or some text.

05:22.430 --> 05:26.890
Now the syntax would be these curly braces and the moment.

05:26.930 --> 05:34.370
Again we're just gonna get a suggestion and and we having the paragraph with the text inside of some

05:34.370 --> 05:38.300
text as well as we can combine whatever we having here.

05:38.310 --> 05:43.790
Let's say if he would want to create multiple items we can say like this one would say on our list then

05:43.790 --> 05:49.650
within the list there is going to be left list items and we're gonna multiply let's say by six.

05:49.820 --> 05:50.990
So I can say something like this.

05:50.990 --> 05:55.930
However within each and every item we can place that number there.

05:55.940 --> 05:59.080
So for this we're gonna have to use the dollar sign like this.

05:59.120 --> 06:04.310
Now the moment we were gonna be looking at a notice by the way right away we can look at the info of

06:04.340 --> 06:05.860
what we're going to be getting anyway.

06:06.020 --> 06:11.960
So that's something really neat with my suggestions where you can expand it and you can see what is

06:11.960 --> 06:13.640
gonna be a result to begin with.

06:13.700 --> 06:17.050
So let's say here again as you see I lost my suggestions.

06:17.060 --> 06:18.470
However no worries.

06:18.470 --> 06:24.980
Just pressing control and spacebar I can get the mark and then either typing return or the tab I'm gonna

06:24.980 --> 06:26.970
be getting the values from 1 to 6.

06:27.440 --> 06:34.760
So this would be the General Snippet syntax with animate that will tremendously is going to speed up

06:34.820 --> 06:35.540
our workflow.
