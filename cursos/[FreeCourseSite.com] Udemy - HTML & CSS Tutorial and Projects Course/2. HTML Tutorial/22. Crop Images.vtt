00:00.670 --> 00:03.090
I couldn't be more proud of ourselves.

00:03.160 --> 00:05.080
We know how to use width and height.

00:05.480 --> 00:09.360
I know both of our images are rendered exactly the same.

00:09.360 --> 00:15.060
Or there is a big issue even that would change the width and height or even if you do it in the sea

00:15.060 --> 00:18.260
assess which again we'll learn later on.

00:18.460 --> 00:24.310
The browser is still rendering that massive image and what happens is if you're going to have tons of

00:24.310 --> 00:31.900
massive images like this then your user whatever is going to be using or visiting your website is going

00:31.900 --> 00:37.690
to experience very slow load times and usually what happens the user is going to wait for three seconds

00:37.690 --> 00:40.600
and then it's just going to leave and find a different page.

00:41.380 --> 00:46.810
So even though we have here with a two fifty nine and one ninety four when we're actually rendering

00:47.200 --> 00:54.880
is still this guy with thousand and six hundred sixty and there's multiple things that we can do in

00:54.880 --> 01:00.970
general we will use some kind of application whether that would be photoshop or something like that

01:01.540 --> 01:05.010
or there is maybe a quick way meaning.

01:05.110 --> 01:11.410
Obviously it's not the best one but let's say as we're working just with HCM Al and SS and we just want

01:11.410 --> 01:15.690
to quickly crop damage we can use the actual Mac.

01:15.910 --> 01:21.340
Now if you're using different operating system you would have to research it how it's done on site windows

01:21.820 --> 01:24.300
more on the market would be kind of simple.

01:24.490 --> 01:25.870
Is it going to look for.

01:25.870 --> 01:30.050
What image we would like to crop as you notice once I right click it.

01:30.100 --> 01:37.210
I have an option of open with and once I navigate to the preview I'm gonna be given option now.

01:37.280 --> 01:42.800
Then my options I'm going to be looking for tools and with the tools we can just adjust the size of

01:42.880 --> 01:47.480
this is the tab that we're going to be looking for now the moment I'm gonna click on it.

01:47.620 --> 01:51.400
Notice here I can change the actual dimensions of the image.

01:51.490 --> 01:56.590
Now here on the right side you might be having different one would say you might have percent or inches

01:56.590 --> 01:58.490
I would suggest going for the pixels.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.990
And then if you have over here this log.

02:01.180 --> 02:05.920
That means that if I'm gonna change the with the height is gonna change automatically.

02:05.920 --> 02:09.570
So if I'm going to write hundred notice this is gonna give me sixty seven.

02:09.580 --> 02:10.990
Now once you click on a log.

02:10.990 --> 02:12.870
Now you can change both of them.

02:12.900 --> 02:17.420
So in this case maybe I can say that the height is still gonna be a thousand but the waste is going

02:17.420 --> 02:18.390
to be a hundred.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.740
Now again this is really up to you.

02:19.740 --> 02:24.040
However you would like to do it in this case it doesn't really matter again.

02:24.100 --> 02:30.700
Let's say that I'm gonna go with again two hundred and fifty nine but I believe right and let me log

02:30.700 --> 02:39.040
this I notice I messed that up a little bit sorry to 59 and this is gonna give me 173 so I can just

02:39.040 --> 02:40.310
click on okay.

02:40.360 --> 02:44.930
Now this is gonna quickly crop my image and again this is probably nothing.

02:45.010 --> 02:50.500
Something you would do in production but in general just for projects whatever you're gonna be doing

02:51.010 --> 02:56.710
this is gonna be good enough where you don't need to learn how you can start using the actual Photoshop.

02:56.740 --> 02:59.920
Now I'm gonna head over back to our project notice again.

03:00.220 --> 03:06.670
We have 259 by 173 instead of thousand and I can also get rid of maybe these guys.

03:06.670 --> 03:15.910
Again it was good thing to learn and it was beneficial for us but in order to save our user a trip to

03:15.910 --> 03:23.230
a kitchen let's say to make a coffee while our page loads we can obviously just crop them images and

03:23.230 --> 03:27.250
that way everything looks much nicer and also performs much nicer.
