WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:01.380
Excellent.

00:01.380 --> 00:04.520
Next in our agenda is going to be the skills section.

00:04.640 --> 00:09.360
We're all gonna have four column layout and within each and every column there's going to be Phantasm

00:09.780 --> 00:15.030
and as we're gonna be hovering first all the background color is gonna change for the whole column as

00:15.030 --> 00:20.310
well as this awesome font awesome icon is gonna move up a little bit then there's just gonna be some

00:20.310 --> 00:27.150
text within the title and within the paragraph as always we we're all gonna have to head over first

00:27.150 --> 00:29.550
to indexation email to get our content.

00:29.640 --> 00:38.730
And here also as always we're going to set up our skills section so we're gonna say skills suction cup

00:38.740 --> 00:44.090
and paste it and let's write all year end of skills section and what we would like to write over here

00:44.570 --> 00:50.300
first maybe let's start with the general section so there is gonna be a section tag that's gonna work

00:50.390 --> 00:57.980
as our divider and as a side note you can already see that we use the H the email semantic tag or the

00:57.980 --> 01:02.990
header so the same thing we're gonna be doing here as we're working with separate section we're all

01:02.990 --> 01:09.500
just gonna setting this up within the separate section element instead of using the Dave or anything

01:09.500 --> 01:13.760
like that which is going to say that there's going to be section you'll want ad section over here you

01:13.760 --> 01:15.170
can go ahead and do that.

01:15.230 --> 01:21.170
Now this is just used for styling so I probably wouldn't suggest that but in general we will gonna do

01:21.170 --> 01:28.160
the same setup where whenever there's gonna be some type of section whether that's skills or about or

01:28.160 --> 01:33.470
I don't know product we we're gonna start placing everything within the section element then we're gonna

01:33.500 --> 01:39.370
add some kind of class and then we're going to obviously go from there within the section there's gonna

01:39.380 --> 01:45.140
be four columns and first we're gonna add the comment that in general this would be one of them and

01:45.140 --> 01:48.280
then we right away again I had again and of skill.

01:48.650 --> 01:55.330
So this would be our single skill the way we're gonna write it is gonna be single skill as well as end

01:55.340 --> 02:01.400
of single skill that's gonna be our setup why again I'm adding the comments because I would want to

02:01.400 --> 02:08.060
copy and paste them four times and I always find it easier where I can see the starting from that particular

02:08.060 --> 02:13.760
thing as well as the ending and the way we're gonna set it up everything within the section since this

02:13.760 --> 02:19.940
would be something individual that could stand on their own we can just place this in the article again

02:19.940 --> 02:25.430
we could have used the div but it makes a little bit more sense semantically if we're placing your everything

02:25.430 --> 02:30.560
within the article now what is gonna be within the article there is gonna be a span and within this

02:30.560 --> 02:35.450
panel we're gonna start using font awesome so the font awesome name for the first guy is gonna be F

02:35.540 --> 02:42.980
Yes f a mug shot let me say this first of all we're not gonna be able to see anything because I needed

02:42.980 --> 02:49.720
to use the at expansion and now I can say it and all the way in the bottom you probably can see that

02:49.720 --> 02:59.460
there's a little cup or mug of tea or coffee could be anything really it's up to your imagination and

02:59.660 --> 03:06.590
then we're after the sperm have our title so we're gonna stay here having three will out right away

03:06.590 --> 03:14.880
from class the class is gonna be skill title and then we'll get right here Made in U S.

03:15.370 --> 03:17.020
That's gonna be our title.

03:17.060 --> 03:22.940
I understand that it might be hard a little bit because we're just placing the HDMI also a lot of things

03:23.060 --> 03:27.730
are gonna be hard to see but you just need to follow along everything that I'm gonna be typing here

03:27.740 --> 03:33.260
and just trust me that eventually we're gonna get to something like this where we just need to add some

03:33.310 --> 03:39.070
style and that's all made in the US is gonna be all right in three and then we're gonna have a paragraph

03:39.100 --> 03:46.480
with class of skill text as well as we would like to place like some 10 words and remember with Emmett

03:46.520 --> 03:50.470
which you could use Lorem and then we're gonna say 10 words.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.140
So that's gonna be our text.

03:52.320 --> 03:59.070
That would be our first single skill but we would need three more because we have total of four.

03:59.070 --> 04:02.950
So in this case again we would need to select whatever skill we're having.

04:03.140 --> 04:07.680
And you can do the keyboard shortcuts you can do copy and paste doesn't really matter.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.590
And now I'm gonna copy and paste this three times.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.700
So one two three.

04:11.720 --> 04:19.170
And here is the case where we would want to start using the different values because there's not gonna

04:19.190 --> 04:21.720
be four of them exactly the same.

04:21.820 --> 04:26.030
There are gonna be a little bit different now for the second one first of all gonna be getting a different

04:26.030 --> 04:26.240
one.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.620
Awesome.

04:27.810 --> 04:30.220
The name is gonna be glass.

04:30.270 --> 04:36.630
Cheers and have to be honest with you I was struggling with the phantasm icons to find the correct one.

04:36.630 --> 04:39.620
So this is really my imagination.

04:39.620 --> 04:43.730
You probably maybe know the better ones so you can use the better ones.

04:44.230 --> 04:47.820
And here we're gonna say relaxation.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.550
That would be with the glass of chairs.

04:50.760 --> 04:53.870
After that we have the F A bomb.

04:54.030 --> 04:55.980
So I'm going to scroll down a little bit.

04:55.980 --> 05:04.770
We're going to say f a bomb and here we're gonna write energy so we can delete this and let's write

05:04.830 --> 05:05.520
energy.

05:05.580 --> 05:10.850
Now that is gonna be our third skill and the fourth one is gonna be a family recipe.

05:11.160 --> 05:16.740
We're first of all let's write this and I'm gonna pronounce probably the font awesome incorrectly that's

05:16.740 --> 05:19.170
why I'm leaving this for the last.

05:19.380 --> 05:23.020
And let's read family recipe.

05:23.070 --> 05:23.900
Let's say this.

05:24.300 --> 05:28.470
And like I said how we're gonna mispronounce this so bear with me.

05:28.470 --> 05:33.080
So I believe this is more than I have best all.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.380
So let's say something like this again.

05:35.400 --> 05:41.160
I haven't really worked with these values meaning in English so my apologies but whatever this is the

05:41.160 --> 05:42.520
name that I'm looking for.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.490
So it's spelled p e SD the.

05:45.600 --> 05:49.620
And again if this is funny how I mispronounced everything.

05:49.620 --> 05:50.640
Hopefully this is funny.

05:50.640 --> 05:55.500
Hopefully you're not mad or anything like that but this would be our HDMI setup.

05:55.530 --> 05:57.870
Now we're done with this section.

05:58.350 --> 06:03.870
As far as the email is concerned obviously we're gonna head over to see and start styling this.
