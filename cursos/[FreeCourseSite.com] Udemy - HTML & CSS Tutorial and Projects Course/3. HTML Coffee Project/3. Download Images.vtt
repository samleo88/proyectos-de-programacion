00:00.410 --> 00:00.960
All righty.

00:00.960 --> 00:02.730
We have our project structure.

00:02.730 --> 00:04.410
So what next.

00:04.440 --> 00:10.470
Now as we're checking the project we can see that there's gonna be few images and as a side note if

00:10.470 --> 00:14.760
you don't want to download the images in this video you need the resources you're obviously going to

00:14.760 --> 00:20.120
be able to find the whole project with all the images they're all going to be using anyway.

00:20.130 --> 00:28.050
Now for the logo it is very simply I went to Google and just search for a copy up logo transparent background

00:28.500 --> 00:32.700
and then obviously there's many wants to pick and I just pick this one.

00:32.700 --> 00:39.030
Now please understand that this is not something the children do for the production project but in our

00:39.030 --> 00:44.280
case since this is just a simple HDMI project we can just do it this way for the logo.

00:44.280 --> 00:47.900
So in this case what I would do is I would just say that I would like to get the image.

00:48.070 --> 00:51.840
So I'm going to say save images and I'm gonna be looking for desktops.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.880
And this is where our project is.

00:53.880 --> 01:00.150
And then within the images I'm gonna say that I would like to save this as a logo and either we can

01:00.150 --> 01:05.160
at BMG ourselves or we can just go with whatever extensions they give us.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.710
So this would be the logo OK after the logo.

01:08.760 --> 01:13.760
We also have one big background image as well as three smaller ones.

01:13.770 --> 01:17.480
So these would be I don't know again for the house blend or French roast.

01:17.570 --> 01:18.920
It doesn't really matter.

01:18.930 --> 01:23.970
The main idea it would be one big macro image and then three smaller ones.

01:24.420 --> 01:29.870
So these images I got again in the pixels the ones that I was telling you before where you can get a

01:29.870 --> 01:31.250
nice copy right.

01:31.250 --> 01:32.350
Free images.

01:32.430 --> 01:37.310
And again if we just start searching where if you search for coffee first of all.

01:37.310 --> 01:43.350
So I went here and typed coffee and as we start scrolling down you can see that there is gonna be quite

01:43.350 --> 01:46.450
a few of them that we're using and let's start with these guys.

01:46.460 --> 01:48.250
And this is gonna be our background.

01:48.450 --> 01:54.540
So let's say here again save you my jazz and I'm just going to call this background and again let's

01:54.540 --> 01:57.690
just go with whatever extension they give us.

01:57.690 --> 02:03.080
Now after that we have house blend and I believe for the house blend.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.980
Scroll down to see where I have this.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.170
Not this guy.

02:08.070 --> 02:10.890
Let's see let's see let's see which one that I pick.

02:10.890 --> 02:12.620
I think I picked this one.

02:12.690 --> 02:22.860
So let's save them a jazz let's name this house blend then on what else we have we have French roast.

02:22.990 --> 02:32.290
So what we looking for this guy and what I have this one wanted to do to you here is saving jazz.

02:32.290 --> 02:42.560
This would be French roast rose and the last one is gonna be I think Colombian Colombian roast and that's

02:42.560 --> 02:44.960
gonna be with an espresso machine.

02:45.110 --> 02:47.510
So it says that this is gonna be Colombian

02:49.970 --> 02:51.240
roast.

02:51.320 --> 02:57.620
Now I have these four images one for the background and three smaller ones and for the smaller ones

02:57.620 --> 03:02.120
again I use the option in the Mac where we can just crop them on a little bit.

03:02.120 --> 03:06.500
So let's say that I was gonna select first all three of them but again not background.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.900
Not logo just these three.

03:09.110 --> 03:14.510
And then I'm gonna open it in the preview and within the preview I would like to select all of them.

03:14.510 --> 03:16.580
So again the shortcut would be commander.

03:17.480 --> 03:22.490
As you noticed right now all the images have been selected and then we can look for the tools and then

03:22.490 --> 03:24.110
we're adjusting the size.

03:24.110 --> 03:27.170
Now in my case I'm gonna click on this little padlock.

03:27.170 --> 03:33.260
So now they're gonna be adjusted exactly like I want not the height you I just did that.

03:33.390 --> 03:37.730
Let's say that I was going to be looking for 320 by 240.

03:38.010 --> 03:44.030
And yeah once we do that these are gonna be our images and everything is set and ready to go.

03:44.150 --> 03:45.770
So we can start working on our project.
