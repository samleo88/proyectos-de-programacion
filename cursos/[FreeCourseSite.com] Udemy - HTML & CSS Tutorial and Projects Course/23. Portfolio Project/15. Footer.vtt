WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:06.030
The last section before then more is going to be the her and it's actually going to be very straightforward

00:06.450 --> 00:10.920
as you can see all year we're going to have in the back room and we're going to send them this play

00:10.920 --> 00:11.620
flex.

00:11.790 --> 00:13.820
And this is going to be space right.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.680
So let's go ahead to the actual index.

00:16.720 --> 00:22.760
And now here in the index the amount this would be the end of contact.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.740
Now Herodes and to say this is going to be the first section.

00:25.940 --> 00:33.180
And once we have our first section then let's create a for a moment with a glass of water over here

00:33.660 --> 00:39.290
and inside or here we're going to say a div with a footer and two underscores.

00:39.330 --> 00:40.910
This is going to be icons.

00:40.950 --> 00:43.090
So this is actually going to be our door.

00:43.440 --> 00:50.470
Now within a day of we're going to have a link here with a for our single icon.

00:50.760 --> 00:56.890
So this is going to be our two hundred core single I got here we're going to have a hash tag.

00:57.180 --> 01:03.750
And once we have all here our link now inside the link what I would want is place the phantasm.

01:03.950 --> 01:09.730
So here is the first one is going to be FHB FAA face book on here.

01:09.750 --> 01:14.530
So I said this here and we should have our eye on all here all the way in the bottom.

01:14.630 --> 01:21.080
Once we have our first link the only thing we need to do is actually copy and paste this one to.

01:21.230 --> 01:23.250
Hour here this is going to be three.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.640
So there's going to be three of them and are just going to change these values around.

01:26.910 --> 01:29.920
So are you going to say this is going to be Twitter.

01:30.030 --> 01:37.830
Over here the next one is actually going to be Instagram Instagram and after that we're here will have

01:37.890 --> 01:43.930
a link and so link or here LinkedIn LinkedIn.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.570
So going to say this.

01:45.680 --> 01:53.260
And now once we have our icons Let's actually go to the US and start actually styling them.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.260
So here we're going to say means.

01:55.620 --> 01:57.910
This is going to be the end of contact.

01:57.930 --> 02:03.560
Let's actually make a little bit more on say where this is going to be for now for the hour.

02:03.690 --> 02:07.150
First I would want is the actual For a moment.

02:07.170 --> 02:14.190
Let's do a background to do background var and this case we're not going to create a separate section

02:14.540 --> 02:17.030
variable's going to this or dark.

02:17.130 --> 02:17.850
So really.

02:17.860 --> 02:19.700
So this is going to be our section.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.200
Then I also want to do a padding.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.610
Three RPMs zero here.

02:26.070 --> 02:30.130
So this is going to be our parting I can see these are going to be a guns.

02:30.540 --> 02:32.880
Then we would want to work with for our icons.

02:32.880 --> 02:39.300
So this was the deal that actually holding the links to underscores icons and are here we're going to

02:39.300 --> 02:46.770
do a display flex like this and I can see that all of them are actually together and they're all going

02:46.770 --> 02:51.570
to have a justified content and we're going to do space and around.

02:51.810 --> 02:57.860
So basically we're going to make sure that there is even amount of actual space in between them.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.010
And I would want a single like.

03:00.390 --> 03:04.470
So I'm going to say over here this is going to be for 200 course.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.090
All I can.

03:06.090 --> 03:13.860
So this is going to be the length and we're working now we one font size to our exams here some massive

03:13.860 --> 03:19.240
font size then we would want a color the color is actually going to be light.

03:19.550 --> 03:23.950
So we're you know going to say that this is going to be a light color once we say it.

03:23.970 --> 03:27.440
Now this is how our icons going to look like.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.620
Now let's do a transition.

03:29.820 --> 03:37.310
So as we're hovering would want him to issue in two seconds easily here and knowledge's do single like

03:37.330 --> 03:38.100
an hour.

03:38.400 --> 03:43.950
So let's do footer saying all I can do however.

03:44.080 --> 03:48.460
So I was hovering what we would want is actually color change to gray.

03:48.540 --> 03:50.280
So I'm going to say color.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.240
I know you agree and this is going to be our transition.

03:54.540 --> 04:01.980
So as you can see as I'm hovering here my actual colors is changing and once we're done with her now

04:01.980 --> 04:04.460
we can start working with a number.
