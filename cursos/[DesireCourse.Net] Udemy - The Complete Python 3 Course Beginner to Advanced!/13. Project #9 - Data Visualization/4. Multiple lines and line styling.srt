00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,270
Hey guys, in this video let's just jump to it.

2

00:00:03,270  -->  00:00:04,680
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to

3

00:00:04,680  -->  00:00:06,569
add another line and so we need to

4

00:00:06,569  -->  00:00:10,469
create two new axes, and so

5

00:00:10,469  -->  00:00:17,250
let's create an axis called deaths. So

6

00:00:17,250  -->  00:00:18,690
we're going to compare the data of

7

00:00:18,690  -->  00:00:23,130
births, or total population, to deaths and

8

00:00:23,130  -->  00:00:26,279
I don't actually have data on this, so

9

00:00:26,279  -->  00:00:28,019
I'm just going to kind of be making it

10

00:00:28,019  -->  00:00:32,880
up. So let's say 1.2, 1.7...

11

00:00:32,880  -->  00:00:44,789
that's four, so I need one more,

12

00:00:44,789  -->  00:00:47,399
and drop down to the next line and I

13

00:00:47,399  -->  00:00:50,070
need to go one, two, three, four, five, six,

14

00:00:50,070  -->  00:01:00,059
seven, eight, nine, I need to put nine in there. So, 2.7...and

15

00:01:00,059  -->  00:01:02,280
these numbers are way higher than

16

00:01:02,280  -->  00:01:05,480
actually would be I think.

17

00:01:12,810  -->  00:01:21,630
Let me look one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, three more, so 3.8,

18

00:01:21,630  -->  00:01:29,520
4.0, and 4.3. So, this isn't

19

00:01:29,520  -->  00:01:30,750
going to do anything as of right now

20

00:01:30,750  -->  00:01:33,479
because i need to actually add another

21

00:01:33,479  -->  00:01:35,429
line here, and how i'm going to do that

22

00:01:35,429  -->  00:01:36,990
is this method right here is what

23

00:01:36,990  -->  00:01:38,970
actually adds the line and configures it,

24

00:01:38,970  -->  00:01:41,009
so I'm going to go ahead and basically

25

00:01:41,009  -->  00:01:44,250
just add this again. So, plt.plot and

26

00:01:44,250  -->  00:01:45,959
then the first one is going to be years

27

00:01:45,959  -->  00:01:49,530
because we're using the same x axis for

28

00:01:49,530  -->  00:01:52,350
this line of data as well. I'm going to say

29

00:01:52,350  -->  00:01:56,220
deaths, and then color, and for this one I'm

30

00:01:56,220  -->  00:01:59,189
going to make it a light blue, so .6,

31

00:01:59,189  -->  00:02:07,860
.6, and 1. And so let's go

32

00:02:07,860  -->  00:02:10,920
ahead and run this example again, and now

33

00:02:10,920  -->  00:02:13,170
you'll see that we have two different

34

00:02:13,170  -->  00:02:16,890
lines, and this would be used to convey

35

00:02:16,890  -->  00:02:19,230
something like the risk of

36

00:02:19,230  -->  00:02:24,090
overpopulation if the population grows,

37

00:02:24,090  -->  00:02:25,709
you can see this is going up higher than

38

00:02:25,709  -->  00:02:27,959
the death rate is, so at some point we're

39

00:02:27,959  -->  00:02:30,359
going to see that

40

00:02:30,359  -->  00:02:31,769
we're creating more people than we're

41

00:02:31,769  -->  00:02:35,609
actually getting rid of. So, yeah, and

42

00:02:35,609  -->  00:02:39,120
then what we could do actually is you

43

00:02:39,120  -->  00:02:43,170
can also modify how the lines are drawn

44

00:02:43,170  -->  00:02:47,880
themselves, and you can also pull the

45

00:02:47,880  -->  00:02:49,829
chart around here by that control right

46

00:02:49,829  -->  00:02:52,980
there. So what I mean by that is you can

47

00:02:52,980  -->  00:03:01,079
add the way that the lines

48

00:03:01,079  -->  00:03:06,870
look by the third parameter here, we can

49

00:03:06,870  -->  00:03:10,019
just pass in like the dash there, two

50

00:03:10,019  -->  00:03:12,150
dashes, and when we run the application

51

00:03:12,150  -->  00:03:15,299
now you'll notice that, that line has

52

00:03:15,299  -->  00:03:20,130
become a dash instead of instead of a

53

00:03:20,130  -->  00:03:22,769
straight line. And so that's how we can

54

00:03:22,769  -->  00:03:24,090
add multiple lines. It's really simple

55

00:03:24,090  -->  00:03:26,390
you just just call the

56

00:03:26,390  -->  00:03:28,010
plot method again and just stuff your

57

00:03:28,010  -->  00:03:30,050
new data into there, and we can even go

58

00:03:30,050  -->  00:03:32,270
further and do it you know multiple

59

00:03:32,270  -->  00:03:35,620
times if we wanted to.
