WEBVTT

00:00.520 --> 00:05.750
Once we have download the setup files now we're ready to go and start working on our project.

00:05.770 --> 00:09.960
So first things first let's create a new folder and desktop.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.880
But as always you can create wherever you would like.

00:13.090 --> 00:17.900
And I'm gonna call mind back roads.

00:18.130 --> 00:19.310
Back roads.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.940
Like so let me zoom in.

00:21.950 --> 00:25.300
As you can see that is the folder that I just created.

00:25.300 --> 00:31.990
Then I'm going to open up my favorite text header visual studio called Drag and drop my folder.

00:31.990 --> 00:38.070
And then within this particular project I would like to first of all create three files.

00:38.230 --> 00:44.380
All right now we're gonna start by creating index the email and we're right away.

00:44.380 --> 00:46.750
Gonna set up so much the email structure.

00:46.750 --> 00:53.290
Again remember we are using the Emmett so exclamation mark and tab and we do have our setup and let's

00:53.290 --> 00:54.000
say here.

00:54.010 --> 01:00.910
Hello hello from back back roads like so.

01:01.040 --> 01:06.110
Then also look to create another filed by the name of style CSX.

01:06.140 --> 01:12.090
However this particular style CSX while I would like to actually set it up within the separate folder.

01:12.160 --> 01:16.970
All right now the way I'm going to do that is in fact by creating another folder.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.610
And in this case I'm gonna zoom in.

01:18.610 --> 01:23.920
I'm going to say a folder name is going to be CSX as well as one folder for JavaScript.

01:24.100 --> 01:28.250
So let's create a j s folder and then we didn't seize this folder.

01:28.260 --> 01:34.740
When we create a new file and then let's just call the style or style CSX or main CSX.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.550
Doesn't really matter.

01:36.550 --> 01:41.770
Just have your style sheet and just so we can test it out whether our styles are working.

01:41.830 --> 01:50.140
I'm gonna go first of all for the body and why don't we have a background of Let's read something like

01:50.140 --> 01:50.580
that.

01:50.650 --> 01:56.170
Let's say it just so we can see for sure that we have linked it correctly and then as far as javascript

01:56.170 --> 01:57.000
is concerned.

01:57.190 --> 02:00.550
Well we're just going to create a new file.

02:00.570 --> 02:03.740
Gonna name it AB J S now.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.160
I don't think we're gonna test that right now.

02:06.160 --> 02:10.120
Of course I'm going to have the script tags where I'm linking my ab app.

02:10.150 --> 02:12.360
But we're not going to test it right now.

02:12.380 --> 02:19.870
All right now as far as the indexation of is concerned first and foremost why don't we change here the

02:19.870 --> 02:27.650
title let's say back roads to our company something like that.

02:27.740 --> 02:35.260
And you know what I could right away create two vertical lines as well so tour company is going to be

02:35.260 --> 02:36.190
my title.

02:36.340 --> 02:37.690
That's number one.

02:37.690 --> 02:43.330
And you know it since I'm gonna be recording and I already have my finished project.

02:43.360 --> 02:49.560
Also side by side I'm gonna add in my title a recording but you know have to so I'm going to write a

02:49.560 --> 02:56.580
recording like so and then I would like to open up also a smaller browser window side by side.

02:57.060 --> 03:01.500
So what I'm gonna do right now is I'm going to open up a new browser window right.

03:02.010 --> 03:08.910
And then I'm gonna use my extension again by the name of preview on a web server.

03:08.920 --> 03:13.280
And in this case I'm going to open up right now my local def server.

03:13.410 --> 03:18.880
So the way we do that is and then we can right click it and we can use the extension of course.

03:19.050 --> 03:24.660
Meaning we have the keyboard shortcut but I'm just gonna go here with launch on the browser.

03:24.710 --> 03:31.650
Can we open this up as you can see I have my project but we can clearly see that my CSF is not working

03:32.160 --> 03:35.320
because remember we did set up a background of red.

03:35.610 --> 03:36.120
OK.

03:36.570 --> 03:41.100
Now let's set this side by side and let's close the app James.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.530
We're not gonna need that.

03:42.530 --> 03:49.650
And as far as Stiles is concerned while we're gonna have within the head element we're gonna have two

03:49.650 --> 03:50.490
comments.

03:50.550 --> 03:55.160
One is going to be for font awesome font awesome.

03:55.370 --> 03:59.730
And then right after the font awesome we're gonna have our styles.

03:59.810 --> 04:05.100
So let's write styles and you know eventually there's also gonna be a favor cone but we're not going

04:05.100 --> 04:06.910
to worry about it right now.

04:06.900 --> 04:12.900
Now as far as styles is concerned well we need to link two styles assess.

04:13.040 --> 04:13.790
Correct.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.390
So let's go for ISIS.

04:16.510 --> 04:23.900
So but we're not looking for style C assess we are looking for the ISIS folder and you know what I'm

04:23.900 --> 04:30.590
going to add right away dot here as well just so everything is displayed properly also in the browser

04:31.130 --> 04:33.810
and then let's look for our style successes.

04:33.860 --> 04:36.700
Let's say we do have our red background.

04:36.890 --> 04:39.850
So that means that everything is working correctly.

04:39.950 --> 04:46.360
My style sheet has been linked collect correctly and then what I also like to do.

04:46.420 --> 04:52.630
Well last thing that I would like to do is in fact get my images as far as setup is concerned.

04:52.700 --> 04:58.380
So within the setup files we have our images folder and I'm just going to copy and paste this folder.

04:58.550 --> 05:03.030
So I'm going to copied it over back to backroads and copy and paste it.

05:03.230 --> 05:05.500
And now we have our images.

05:05.530 --> 05:06.110
OK.

05:06.360 --> 05:12.680
Now that should be it as far as the setup is concerned and I guess the last thing before we actually

05:12.680 --> 05:19.640
head over the next video I'm just gonna open up my local host 80 80 just so I can show you on a bigger

05:19.640 --> 05:20.790
browser window.

05:20.840 --> 05:28.670
Our current project I also like to mention that I have zoomed in as you can see my zoom is 175.

05:29.060 --> 05:35.630
So some things might not look exactly like yours in a sense because I have zoomed in just so I can see

05:35.630 --> 05:36.420
it better.

05:36.620 --> 05:41.930
But as far as the rest of the project is concerned of course everything is going to be exactly the same.

05:41.930 --> 05:42.950
Just please can mine.

05:42.950 --> 05:49.730
Keep in mind that when a man at a smaller browser window well some things might look a little bit different

05:49.730 --> 05:50.330
than yours.

05:50.630 --> 05:52.220
If you don't have the same zoom.
