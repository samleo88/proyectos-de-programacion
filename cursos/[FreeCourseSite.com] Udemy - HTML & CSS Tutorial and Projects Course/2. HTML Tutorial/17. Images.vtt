00:00.510 --> 00:04.890
These days it would be really hard to find a Web site without images.

00:04.890 --> 00:09.280
So maybe let's see how we can get images to our HMO.

00:09.530 --> 00:13.340
The issue is that first we would need to get an image to our system.

00:13.470 --> 00:18.360
So some kind of image that we would use first of all let me get rid of this paragraph.

00:18.360 --> 00:22.360
I can just delete it and save it in hours and there's gonna be nothing here.

00:22.530 --> 00:25.410
And now we're gonna go online and search for image.

00:25.410 --> 00:27.000
Now I can obviously do it.

00:27.020 --> 00:31.050
You're on the right hand side but I think it's gonna be easier for us to see if I'm gonna open up the

00:31.050 --> 00:33.580
new browser window somewhere.

00:33.590 --> 00:36.340
I'm gonna make it out to maximize it again.

00:36.480 --> 00:41.460
It's easier for you to follow along and let's say that we're going to search for some kind of image.

00:41.700 --> 00:51.640
So let's say are you Demi in Demi image and let's see someone's gonna come up instead of some kind of

00:51.640 --> 00:56.930
text we're gonna click on images and now we have plenty of images to choose from.

00:56.980 --> 00:59.890
Now in this case I'm gonna get this one.

00:59.890 --> 01:05.440
And in order to save it our machine we would need to use the save him in jazz.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.570
And this is gonna save the image.

01:07.570 --> 01:09.520
Now obviously this is gonna somewhere.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.090
Save it wherever we are.

01:11.130 --> 01:16.260
We'd like so in our case we would like to save it in the folder we're working on.

01:16.570 --> 01:22.140
Now you can save it in desktop if you want but eventually would need to have access in the HMO.

01:22.600 --> 01:28.030
So I would suggest right away navigating through HD in my folder or folder whatever you have.

01:28.030 --> 01:31.500
Or this examples and then save this image.

01:31.640 --> 01:37.700
Now in my case I'm going to call this you Demi and then this is gonna give it the PMG extension.

01:37.780 --> 01:39.500
So now I'm gonna save the image.

01:39.520 --> 01:45.290
And sure enough we have the image now getting the image was the first part and we can always think that

01:45.300 --> 01:46.880
we'll check it a nation email.

01:46.930 --> 01:49.180
Sure enough this is gonna be our image.

01:49.180 --> 01:55.420
Now we need to see how we can get it in document because on lefthand side we can see that we have new

01:55.420 --> 01:56.350
file.

01:56.350 --> 02:04.330
We have you Demi TNG our it is obviously not showing up in a document now the way we display or render

02:04.330 --> 02:10.900
images in a single document is you guessed it the image element.

02:10.900 --> 02:15.090
Now for the image element the actual syntax would be I g.

02:15.300 --> 02:19.660
I can just start typing I am G and then it gives us plenty of options.

02:19.660 --> 02:22.960
Now we can just go with the regular one and notice what happens.

02:23.140 --> 02:29.100
We are giving the image element and remember team image element was without a closing tag.

02:29.590 --> 02:35.530
So this was a self closing element or we're noticing two interesting things we're getting something

02:35.530 --> 02:42.160
called sauce and old now sauce an old R attribute.

02:42.730 --> 02:48.600
So whenever we are thinking about HDMI elements whatever is going to be in in between the tags is gonna

02:48.610 --> 02:53.440
be rendered however attributes would describe the element.

02:53.530 --> 02:59.460
So there's gonna be attributes there are specific to a specific element and then there's gonna be attributes

02:59.460 --> 03:06.700
that say that each and every element can have now for the image we have the source that you never saw

03:06.690 --> 03:10.590
such a boot is gonna tell us where are we gonna be looking for the image.

03:10.620 --> 03:16.520
Because obviously for HD the email actually Mel would need to know where to get the image that's going

03:16.520 --> 03:21.950
to be rendered now alternative is gonna be if we cannot render the image for some reason.

03:22.290 --> 03:26.500
So let's say the path is wrong or something is not working correctly.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.520
Then this text is gonna be displayed.

03:28.770 --> 03:33.020
Now as always I thing is gonna be easier for me to show you how this would work.

03:33.150 --> 03:39.170
So if we know that we have this Udemy that page now in a source we would need to specifically say path

03:39.850 --> 03:42.540
no path is where this image is located.

03:42.750 --> 03:47.460
And if the image is located in the same folder we just need to have forward slash.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.220
And check this out what happened.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.630
So now we have two options.

03:50.880 --> 03:56.690
We have either indexation the amount which is the file that we work on and we have you at the MEP entry.

03:56.760 --> 04:02.520
So if you are in the image element and you would like to render this you dummy image.

04:02.520 --> 04:03.990
Which one do you think you would have to pick.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.530
Indexation MLA or your MEP entry.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.030
I think that would be your MEP entry.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.570
So once I say this notice what happened.

04:12.570 --> 04:14.810
Sure enough right now I'm getting my image.

04:14.880 --> 04:20.490
However let's say first of all I'm gonna change this and I'm gonna say for some reason I'm gonna mistakenly

04:20.490 --> 04:23.170
say that this is going to be J not be energy.

04:23.190 --> 04:25.820
First of all then let's see what happens.

04:25.950 --> 04:28.980
The image is not displayed because our path is wrong.

04:29.100 --> 04:29.850
It's not correct.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.870
However who would have the alternative here.

04:33.050 --> 04:38.170
And we're gonna say the image of you dummy.

04:38.340 --> 04:40.890
And sure enough now we're gonna have the image of you dummy.

04:41.580 --> 04:45.400
So this is gonna be displayed if we cannot access the image.

04:45.400 --> 04:54.120
This is gonna be like a alternative syntax if we cannot render the image properly in the HMO.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.860
First of all let me fix this.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.510
Let's say that this will gonna be PMG.

04:58.530 --> 05:00.810
And again we're getting back our image.

05:00.930 --> 05:04.470
So let's quickly reiterate what we learn in this video.

05:04.470 --> 05:10.560
First and foremost if we would need the image we would need to get a image from somewhere.

05:10.590 --> 05:13.620
Now that could be from Google like we just did.

05:13.650 --> 05:20.100
Later on we're going to look at a alternative sources how we can get image then once we have the image

05:20.100 --> 05:24.650
in our project in order to access the image we would need to use the image tags.

05:24.870 --> 05:29.280
So the image element now image element is gonna have attributes.

05:29.310 --> 05:34.010
Now one of the attributes is gonna be the source and the second was gonna be alternative.

05:34.150 --> 05:40.440
Now for the source we need to show the path and if the path is gonna be in the same folder we just use

05:40.470 --> 05:43.660
a forward slash and then whatever name of damage.

05:43.680 --> 05:48.710
However we also are going to have suggestions from the Visual Studio code.

05:48.810 --> 05:54.660
So if we're really not trying hard it's kind of hard to mess it up and then alternative is gonna be

05:54.660 --> 05:55.220
displayed.

05:55.260 --> 05:57.990
If the email cannot find the image.
