00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,330
Hey guys, welcome back. I understand that

2

00:00:02,340  -->  00:00:04,070
for the most part we are not going to be

3

00:00:04,080  -->  00:00:06,470
dealing with strings in HTTP responses,

4

00:00:06,480  -->  00:00:08,089
so in this video we're going to learn

5

00:00:08,099  -->  00:00:09,919
about templates a little bit and we're

6

00:00:09,929  -->  00:00:11,120
going to be following that into the next

7

00:00:11,130  -->  00:00:13,370
video as well. So what we need to do is

8

00:00:13,380  -->  00:00:15,230
in our blog application here we need to

9

00:00:15,240  -->  00:00:17,599
create a directory, we're going to call that

10

00:00:17,609  -->  00:00:22,730
templates, and then in here we could

11

00:00:22,740  -->  00:00:25,429
create just regular old HTML files and I'm

12

00:00:25,439  -->  00:00:26,390
going to name this one

13

00:00:26,400  -->  00:00:32,959
index and I'm going to select all

14

00:00:32,969  -->  00:00:37,729
here, "&lt;h1&gt;I'm an index page.&lt;h1&gt;"

15

00:00:37,739  -->  00:00:41,750
Alright, we're going to save that. Now

16

00:00:41,760  -->  00:00:44,330
in our views we actually need

17

00:00:44,340  -->  00:00:48,020
to basically just change from using HTTP

18

00:00:48,030  -->  00:00:50,240
response to using render, and the render

19

00:00:50,250  -->  00:00:52,069
call is a bit different. So what I'm going

20

00:00:52,079  -->  00:00:54,979
to do is I'm going to delete this, i'm

21

00:00:54,989  -->  00:00:56,930
going to type "render" and this is also

22

00:00:56,940  -->  00:00:59,689
a method so what we need to do basically

23

00:00:59,699  -->  00:01:03,470
is pass in the request first "(request)" and then

24

00:01:03,480  -->  00:01:05,479
the name of the template file so in this

25

00:01:05,489  -->  00:01:08,060
case it's 'index.html' and then

26

00:01:08,070  -->  00:01:10,490
parameters as well which for right now

27

00:01:10,500  -->  00:01:12,140
is just going to be that the object { } So

28

00:01:12,150  -->  00:01:16,490
go ahead and save, and then we can load

29

00:01:16,500  -->  00:01:18,620
up this page and we're still in the

30

00:01:18,630  -->  00:01:21,170
single post page so let me go ahead and

31

00:01:21,180  -->  00:01:23,810
get over to main page, and as you can see

32

00:01:23,820  -->  00:01:26,390
this is an h1 element and so we're actually

33

00:01:26,400  -->  00:01:29,060
loading up HTML templates and here you

34

00:01:29,070  -->  00:01:30,590
can do a lot more than you'd be able to

35

00:01:30,600  -->  00:01:33,260
do right here. Now in the next video

36

00:01:33,270  -->  00:01:34,160
we're actually going to learn about

37

00:01:34,170  -->  00:01:36,020
getting our posts out and showing an

38

00:01:36,030  -->  00:01:43,490
index page of all of our posts.
