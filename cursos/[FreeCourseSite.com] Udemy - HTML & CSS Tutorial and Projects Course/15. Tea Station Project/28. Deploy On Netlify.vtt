00:00.360 --> 00:06.900
After we have been working so hard on our project we definitely want to host it online so the rest of

00:06.900 --> 00:08.170
the world can see.

00:08.250 --> 00:14.460
And while there's definitely many many possible options I chose to use that voice because I like the

00:14.460 --> 00:20.190
fact that first of all is free so we can use it for free and we don't have to pay anything so I don't

00:20.190 --> 00:25.560
have to tell you to sign up for something and start paying or leaving your credit card information as

00:25.560 --> 00:27.750
well as I find it hassle free.

00:27.900 --> 00:33.110
Meaning that is really easy to set it up and they provide you a lot of help.

00:33.210 --> 00:38.130
So if you get stuck you can always solve your problem and for days again you're just going to have to

00:38.130 --> 00:40.190
sign up with your email.

00:40.200 --> 00:45.810
Now you have an option obviously if you're using GitHub you can sign up with your GitHub or currently

00:45.810 --> 00:48.870
I don't know how many of you right now have to get up.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.300
So I would suggest if you don't know.

00:51.350 --> 00:53.340
Get help if you haven't used the getup.

00:53.370 --> 00:54.520
Just use your email.

00:54.540 --> 00:57.920
And again this is just gonna be as simple as just filling out the form.

00:57.930 --> 00:58.950
Hey this is my name.

00:58.940 --> 01:00.300
This is my password.

01:00.300 --> 01:02.860
And sign up and you're going to be good to go.

01:02.910 --> 01:07.170
Now the moment you're gonna be signing up then you're going to be met by the screen.

01:07.170 --> 01:12.870
Obviously you're not gonna have any kind of pages since I have right now currently few that I have used

01:12.930 --> 01:15.050
or already these different courses.

01:15.060 --> 01:17.460
How are you gonna get the screen.

01:17.460 --> 01:19.620
Basically we're all going to have two options.

01:19.780 --> 01:24.380
One side from get which we're gonna see later on with different projects.

01:24.430 --> 01:28.960
However we also have this drag and drop and this is something that we're going to use right now.

01:29.110 --> 01:31.500
And this is why I'm saying that this is gonna be so easy.

01:31.500 --> 01:37.200
So the only thing we're gonna be doing here is just dragon dropping your folder there and this is gonna

01:37.200 --> 01:42.900
be uploading and you can see right away that the notify is going to start building our site and within

01:42.900 --> 01:45.190
seconds our site is gonna be alive.

01:45.240 --> 01:51.090
One thing you might find a little bit confusing or annoying is the fact that this is gonna have this

01:51.090 --> 01:56.860
you are all romantics once and a meaning they're all gonna change it each and every time so you'll probably

01:57.030 --> 02:03.600
have a different one or you do have an option of going and changing and if you click on site then you

02:03.600 --> 02:09.600
have change site name and then we can just change it to whatever you'd like as long as we're just using

02:09.600 --> 02:10.800
their free service.

02:10.800 --> 02:16.050
If we don't have our own you URL then obviously they we're gonna have this notify dot com.

02:16.070 --> 02:24.180
Well let's say for us I'm just gonna say to well let me write the email CSX the station.

02:24.180 --> 02:31.290
Obviously you can name yours how you like but just understand that some names can be already taken Station

02:31.950 --> 02:37.820
project and I'm just gonna go with very long one for sure so there's no other name for it.

02:37.870 --> 02:45.960
Recording re coding so they shouldn't give me my URL then I'm gonna save it and as I have her over back

02:46.320 --> 02:51.450
I'm gonna say that this is gonna be my form and as you can see right now this is our Web site and this

02:51.450 --> 02:53.390
is obviously being watched live.

02:53.430 --> 02:58.470
Now one thing I do want to mention since we're using the form we're going to have to again activate

02:58.470 --> 02:59.510
it one more time.

02:59.670 --> 03:05.940
So let's say here I was working with John because when we activate locally there was one thing but again

03:05.940 --> 03:11.850
we're going to have to do the same thing as our site is live on the net file that com let's say again

03:11.850 --> 03:16.530
email dot com or you know what let's write Bob otherwise you're gonna think or Peter.

03:16.620 --> 03:21.910
Otherwise you're gonna think that I'm using the same things and actually this is not true.

03:21.930 --> 03:25.740
So email dot com I'm gonna say hello.

03:25.740 --> 03:29.830
They're wonderful people.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.690
And then we're gonna click it send.

03:31.800 --> 03:36.360
And again this is gonna do the same thing where it says well your form needs an activation.

03:36.360 --> 03:40.480
So we're gonna wait again in the mailbox for the form then we can activate it.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.630
And then everything is going to be working fine.

03:42.660 --> 03:46.420
Then we can go back and the moment we're gonna head over back to our site.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.590
What do we have in our mailbox.

03:48.630 --> 03:50.740
We have a message from Peter.

03:50.890 --> 03:52.560
Email Email dot com.

03:52.710 --> 03:53.460
And hello.

03:53.460 --> 03:54.760
They're wonderful people.

03:54.870 --> 03:56.220
So awesome guys.

03:56.220 --> 03:59.580
We build our first site we published it online.

03:59.580 --> 04:01.630
So why don't we keep on rolling.

04:01.680 --> 04:08.040
And look at the different things from CSX and how we can build interesting projects using that knowledge.
