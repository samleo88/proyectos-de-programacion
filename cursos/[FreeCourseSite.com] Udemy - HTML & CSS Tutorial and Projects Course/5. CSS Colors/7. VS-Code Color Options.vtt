00:00.660 --> 00:06.450
It would also be a crime for my part not to mention the awesome tools that Visual Studio code offers

00:06.450 --> 00:08.260
us whenever we work with colors.

00:08.760 --> 00:11.040
So let's say if I'm looking at this hex code.

00:11.100 --> 00:12.910
What if I would like to change the code.

00:12.990 --> 00:16.290
Would you notice as I'm hovering over the color I have these option.

00:16.290 --> 00:20.240
So first and foremost I could change whatever values I'm getting there.

00:20.490 --> 00:22.750
So as you can see right now I'm working with hex value.

00:23.070 --> 00:27.580
What if what if I change my mind and I say you know what I would like to have the HSN.

00:27.990 --> 00:29.460
Well I can just click on it.

00:29.620 --> 00:31.500
And now my values in HSN.

00:31.960 --> 00:37.050
Now I find want our Gibby I'm getting the RG And I also noticed something else.

00:37.230 --> 00:44.700
If you have here this board this color board has a left clicking on this that I can just change whatever

00:44.700 --> 00:45.880
color value I have.

00:46.530 --> 00:48.860
And it gives me the values here in our.

00:49.140 --> 00:52.370
So let's say here I'm looking for this color and I would want that one.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.140
Let's say black one Light's brighter one.

00:55.290 --> 00:59.240
And here on the right hand side I can just change the color scheme altogether.

00:59.430 --> 01:00.840
So let's say I don't like the red one.

01:00.870 --> 01:02.950
Well what about if we're trying out.

01:03.030 --> 01:03.700
Green.

01:03.810 --> 01:05.360
What about red again.

01:05.400 --> 01:10.650
I can go on and on the whole day to show you that you kinds of you have all kinds of options.

01:10.920 --> 01:13.440
Now we can also control the opacity.

01:13.440 --> 01:18.280
So even though this is gonna be the color then here we're looking basically for the tone.

01:18.330 --> 01:20.280
We also can change the opacity.

01:20.280 --> 01:26.630
And if I'm gonna go completely over here to the zero I'm going to have our GPA value of zero.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.360
Now remember what was the zero what it was totally transparent.

01:30.360 --> 01:35.250
So if I'm gonna say this right now check it out you're not gonna be able to see any of the text because

01:35.250 --> 01:38.250
right now the opacity is level was all the way down to zero.

01:38.430 --> 01:40.180
If you want opacity zero point five.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.360
Wow let's go somewhere there is zero point five.

01:42.810 --> 01:46.600
And then this is going to spit me back some value of whatever I'm having.

01:46.800 --> 01:52.020
Again if I would like to change it to let's say head color right away I can just change it to hex color.

01:52.110 --> 01:57.540
So we have all kinds of options here with Visual Studio code and all of these things combined make it

01:57.540 --> 01:59.370
the best text that are out there.
