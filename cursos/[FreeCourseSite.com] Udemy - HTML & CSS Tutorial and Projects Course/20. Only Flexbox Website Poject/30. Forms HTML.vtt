WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:07.290
And now that we're back in our age you know like I said before we would want to do here instead of theme.

00:07.570 --> 00:11.380
When I say we're here customer I'm going to see the reviews.

00:11.550 --> 00:16.620
And let's maybe scroll up and let's actually check whether all of them are correct.

00:16.670 --> 00:21.690
Right over here this is going to be teams is going to be numbers that are going out.

00:21.690 --> 00:24.120
Portfolio services.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.940
How about skills.

00:25.950 --> 00:26.300
Right.

00:26.330 --> 00:30.410
So looks like they're on Match and the last section or here.

00:30.430 --> 00:34.050
We're going to build is going to be our contact section.

00:34.050 --> 00:38.270
So what we're going to do here we're going to have a contact.

00:38.360 --> 00:46.920
So here we are saying this is going to be a comment and this is going to be contact form and then we

00:46.920 --> 00:47.740
have this.

00:47.750 --> 00:48.840
So like the whole line.

00:48.840 --> 00:53.530
Copy and paste on and off contact form.

00:53.610 --> 00:59.250
Then over here we're going to have a section I'm going to say section then we're going to have an idea

00:59.250 --> 01:04.110
of contact here contact pro-stem or here.

01:04.110 --> 01:09.800
Now we have a section that we would want a title so I'm going to grab all here.

01:09.860 --> 01:14.830
I know this and I'm going to copy this one.

01:14.970 --> 01:20.360
We're going to find words in the section over here to say this is going to be contact us.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.430
I'm going right over here not customer reviews.

01:23.460 --> 01:26.220
Contact us.

01:26.580 --> 01:30.680
Then once we have this now we would want a contact center.

01:30.680 --> 01:31.670
So we're here.

01:31.710 --> 01:39.870
This is title and we're going to say over here contact right in your line contact.

01:40.070 --> 01:43.900
We're going to say center center tab.

01:43.980 --> 01:50.220
Now we have it then over here we're going to have a article and I'm going to say article and this is

01:50.220 --> 01:52.910
going to be an ID of company.

01:53.160 --> 01:58.660
So a hash tag company or here I be your company in.

01:58.710 --> 02:04.440
Right this is going to be on the press time and I'll have the article and over here we're going to have

02:04.440 --> 02:05.840
a few things.

02:06.260 --> 02:12.210
And first of all we have a div with the class all here so we don't need to write the class.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.730
I don't know why I'm writing it and we need to write.

02:14.770 --> 02:20.620
I had some real info on here within this day we're going to have a few things.

02:20.640 --> 02:26.460
So first of all going to have I don't know we're going to say this is going to be a half a and this

02:26.460 --> 02:33.510
is going to be my map marker this press time no see or hear this slow doc.

02:33.580 --> 02:39.090
And then over here we're going to say that this is going to be on here a paragraph and we're going to

02:39.090 --> 02:49.590
say some street drive basically I'm just trying to say that and say this is going to be like 80 300

02:49.690 --> 02:53.400
All right some street and drive.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.840
Then after that we're going to have a phone.

02:55.870 --> 02:56.330
Right.

02:56.490 --> 02:59.870
So what would want to do here and this is going to be one value.

02:59.870 --> 03:03.070
So one more here then is going to be the second one.

03:03.150 --> 03:08.640
This is going to be the phone then we're going to have an envelope that we're going to have a clock.

03:08.640 --> 03:12.360
So this is going to be over here for them.

03:12.420 --> 03:18.540
So for us to have marker street drive then out here we're going to have a phone.

03:18.750 --> 03:24.310
So the second one is going to be phone phone or here.

03:24.570 --> 03:26.240
And I'm sorry not over there.

03:26.320 --> 03:30.970
That's still going to be involved here this is going to be painful.

03:31.060 --> 03:31.960
Do you want to.

03:31.980 --> 03:33.630
Here's the phone.

03:33.810 --> 03:41.370
So we're going to write phone on here and not map just a regular I have a phone.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.760
So all we're here for the phone.

03:43.770 --> 03:50.910
Let's actually get rid of this let's say that this is going to be I don't know one two three four five

03:50.910 --> 03:54.540
six seven eight nine and we're here.

03:54.580 --> 03:56.590
And then once we have all of them we're here right.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.040
I mean pull next one is not going to be marker.

03:59.040 --> 04:07.320
This is going to be and hope some would say envelope you know this and this is going to be let's say

04:07.380 --> 04:09.150
e-mail or e-mail.

04:09.270 --> 04:12.490
So going right over here e-mail over here.

04:12.510 --> 04:17.100
This is going to be a at e mail dot com.

04:17.740 --> 04:21.830
And then after that we're going to have Clark So I'm going to say here.

04:21.900 --> 04:25.210
This is going to be a clock and this is going to be Clark.

04:25.710 --> 04:27.900
I want to hear or hear over all right.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.440
This is going to be 24/7.

04:29.640 --> 04:34.690
So basically we're saying we're open 24/7 24 who are here.

04:35.040 --> 04:40.220
And this is going to be let's say seven or heroes going to ride like this.

04:40.380 --> 04:47.180
All right so now we have all this left right and you can see that this is a bit messed up right now

04:47.210 --> 04:48.570
that we have left side.

04:48.570 --> 04:50.910
Now it's make our right side.

04:51.570 --> 04:55.170
So let's check what is going on to go ahead and let's create another one.

04:55.470 --> 04:58.180
I'm going to say article or here will going right.

04:58.180 --> 05:04.910
And this is going to be I.D. of course Stemmer on here in full press tab.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.240
Now we have another article.

05:06.360 --> 05:15.420
And once we have the article here let's create a form in this form element class and let's say that

05:15.420 --> 05:17.580
this is going to be equal to form.

05:17.610 --> 05:20.420
Again let's close this one out.

05:20.640 --> 05:21.990
So now we have the form.

05:22.200 --> 05:28.350
And over here we're going to say this is going to be put first time right so we have input text.

05:28.380 --> 05:29.700
Yes that's correct.

05:29.970 --> 05:35.920
And we'll have ID here this is going to be a name that we have a placeholder here we're going to read

05:35.930 --> 05:42.070
and this is going to be name for the placeholder and or Herodes is going to copy and paste this can

05:42.070 --> 05:46.190
maybe make this one a little bit smaller so it's easier for us.

05:46.240 --> 05:50.820
Again let's select the line and this is going to be one two three four.

05:51.030 --> 05:57.060
And then at the end of the form we're here we're going to place actually a button.

05:57.360 --> 06:01.570
So I'm going to say we're here and this is going to be hey we're here like this.

06:01.590 --> 06:02.050
Right.

06:02.130 --> 06:11.300
But still with an article saying ref this hashtag and then over here it in the link We're going to play.

06:11.310 --> 06:18.620
And I have a half a all up on here.

06:18.760 --> 06:25.780
Last time now we have the envelope and the text is going to be send a message like this.

06:25.860 --> 06:30.210
Right now we have pretty much everything we just need to change some things around here.

06:30.210 --> 06:30.740
Right.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.830
So the second one or here is going to be made.

06:34.210 --> 06:39.150
Third one is going to be a context for what is going to be text is going to be.

06:39.150 --> 06:46.530
Now then this is going to be just all going to say subject subject then this is going to have an idea

06:46.530 --> 06:51.100
of message and and here we're also going to do it the same way.

06:51.130 --> 06:51.640
Right.

06:51.870 --> 07:01.350
So I'm going to say a message then this is going to be subject subject and here we're going to see now

07:02.410 --> 07:09.120
now that we're done with this I can actually go ahead and go to see assess and start styling this.
