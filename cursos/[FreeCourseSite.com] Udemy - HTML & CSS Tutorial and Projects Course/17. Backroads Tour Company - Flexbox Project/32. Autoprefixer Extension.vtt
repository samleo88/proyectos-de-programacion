Excellent guys.

00:01.330 --> 00:06.280
We're done with our project but there is one more thing that I would like to show you and that is how

00:06.280 --> 00:14.230
we can add our oral prefixes automatically so we don't have to manually go one by one and keep on adding

00:14.260 --> 00:17.000
in our sheer says no not to do that.

00:17.020 --> 00:21.340
We're gonna have to install the extension so let's head over to our extensions.

00:21.430 --> 00:22.120
Let me zoom in.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.340
That would be the tab that you need to click.

00:24.790 --> 00:32.860
And then up here on the top we're gonna have to search for order prefix sir extension.

00:32.900 --> 00:38.730
Now once we get the extension let's just install it and as a certain note this is just one of the ways.

00:38.750 --> 00:44.540
But in this particular case I think it's the probably fastest way how we can do that.

00:44.660 --> 00:50.300
So let's install it first of all our extension and then once we have our extension we're going to have

00:50.300 --> 00:57.360
to navigate to our command pallet and then just type a angle bracket and auto prefix services.

00:57.380 --> 00:59.960
So let me close my particular extension.

00:59.960 --> 01:07.580
Then let's select everything that we have within the CSX Well like so then in order to open the command

01:07.580 --> 01:13.940
pilot not just press command and B and then like I said we have the angle bracket and you know what.

01:13.940 --> 01:20.520
In this case let me zoom in and notice that we have a right away option of using model prefixes.

01:20.540 --> 01:24.050
Now we just type that and we should be good to go.

01:24.100 --> 01:29.160
Now let me zoom out in this case and if you need to run it one more time.

01:29.330 --> 01:34.850
If let's say it did more just do the same thing again select everything that you have within your assess

01:35.150 --> 01:36.670
and just run the command.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.560
Now in my case it ran right away.

01:39.620 --> 01:46.670
So notice I have even my box sizing and I have the browser prefix for that particular property.

01:46.670 --> 01:50.150
Now of course we are mostly interested in the flex box.

01:50.150 --> 01:53.800
So let's scroll down where we start using the Flex box.

01:53.940 --> 01:55.010
And there you go.

01:55.010 --> 01:59.660
Previously we had display of flex and justify content on all items.

01:59.660 --> 02:05.880
But now once we run our extension we have the browser prefixes that we were looking for.

02:06.020 --> 02:08.670
And as you saw we didn't have to do that manually.

02:08.870 --> 02:10.970
It was done automatically for us.

02:10.970 --> 02:17.840
So that is one of the ways how we can add browser prefixes automatically to our CSX.
