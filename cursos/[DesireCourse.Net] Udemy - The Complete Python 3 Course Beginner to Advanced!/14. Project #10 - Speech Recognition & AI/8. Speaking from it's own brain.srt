1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,440
Alright, so, what we're going to be doing

2

00:00:04,440  -->  00:00:09,150
here is connecting our answer class, the

3

00:00:09,150  -->  00:00:10,800
fetcher here, it's going to fetch the web

4

00:00:10,800  -->  00:00:13,980
page that we specify, we're going to

5

00:00:13,980  -->  00:00:15,839
connect that to commands. So right now

6

00:00:15,839  -->  00:00:18,330
what happens, and let's trace this back,

7

00:00:18,330  -->  00:00:26,039
as soon as we start speaking it's going

8

00:00:26,039  -->  00:00:28,260
to play a ding sound, and then we say

9

00:00:28,260  -->  00:00:29,880
something, and then it plays the audio

10

00:00:29,880  -->  00:00:33,390
end sound. Then it uses Google to recognize

11

00:00:33,390  -->  00:00:36,690
what we're saying, and if it can it

12

00:00:36,690  -->  00:00:39,870
instantiates the discoverer that we

13

00:00:39,870  -->  00:00:44,730
created right up, where did we do that? Is it in

14

00:00:44,730  -->  00:00:52,710
here? That's commander...cmd that's what we

15

00:00:52,710  -->  00:00:56,309
called it. Here's where we

16

00:00:56,309  -->  00:00:58,260
instantiated it, there we go. So we've

17

00:00:58,260  -->  00:01:01,050
created our commander instance and then

18

00:01:01,050  -->  00:01:02,820
down here we run the discover command,

19

00:01:02,820  -->  00:01:04,680
then we pass through our text whatever

20

00:01:04,680  -->  00:01:08,130
that might be. So now if our text has

21

00:01:08,130  -->  00:01:15,840
what in your name we just tell it you

22

00:01:15,840  -->  00:01:20,939
know what to say. Otherwise, we're going to

23

00:01:20,939  -->  00:01:25,320
create our fetcher here. So we're going

24

00:01:25,320  -->  00:01:28,110
to say f equals fetcher, and we're going

25

00:01:28,110  -->  00:01:31,259
to pass in a URL. The URL is going to be,

26

00:01:31,259  -->  00:01:36,180
let's collect this right

27

00:01:36,180  -->  00:01:43,350
here, I'm going to paste this in there,

28

00:01:43,350  -->  00:01:49,680
and then we're going to say plus text. So,

29

00:01:49,680  -->  00:01:51,600
it's going to instantiate, this should all

30

00:01:51,600  -->  00:01:53,970
work correctly, so I'm going to ask this

31

00:01:53,970  -->  00:01:55,950
question now and let's see what happens.

32

00:01:55,950  -->  00:02:03,290
"How can I make pie?"

33

00:02:11,400  -->  00:02:13,420
...

34

00:02:13,420  -->  00:02:26,770
Alright, so, it found how to make a pie

35

00:02:26,770  -->  00:02:28,330
and that's because when you misspell

36

00:02:28,330  -->  00:02:30,670
something on Google, let's say, that's

37

00:02:30,670  -->  00:02:32,470
pretty neat, actually. Let's say I search

38

00:02:32,470  -->  00:02:42,160
for how can I make my...that's odd that it

39

00:02:42,160  -->  00:02:43,420
actually gave me a different set of

40

00:02:43,420  -->  00:02:48,430
results, cool though. How can I make my...

41

00:02:48,430  -->  00:02:51,370
and it "failed bro," and so it prints out.

42

00:02:51,370  -->  00:02:54,190
Where did it fail? Let me see...

43

00:02:54,190  -->  00:03:00,549
Alright, so it couldn't find that, but it did

44

00:03:00,549  -->  00:03:02,440
generate our page correctly because it

45

00:03:02,440  -->  00:03:11,319
waited. I wonder if that changed. I could

46

00:03:11,319  -->  00:03:15,519
print out the, yeah, anyway, we're gonna

47

00:03:15,519  -->  00:03:18,400
skip that. What we're looking for is that

48

00:03:18,400  -->  00:03:21,100
block that actually tells us how to make

49

00:03:21,100  -->  00:03:23,709
the pie and if you recall that block is

50

00:03:23,709  -->  00:03:27,519
right here on this dynamic page which is

51

00:03:27,519  -->  00:03:29,620
built for newer browsers, which is what

52

00:03:29,620  -->  00:03:32,079
we see if we use Chrome and Safari, it's

53

00:03:32,079  -->  00:03:33,670
going to have a different class, but if

54

00:03:33,670  -->  00:03:34,989
we were to use a really, really old

55

00:03:34,989  -->  00:03:38,500
browser, or it's just the type of browser

56

00:03:38,500  -->  00:03:41,560
that Phantom.js uses, it's going to give us

57

00:03:41,560  -->  00:03:42,940
a different set of results. Now I've

58

00:03:42,940  -->  00:03:44,709
already parsed through it and I found

59

00:03:44,709  -->  00:03:47,440
the class, that is this, and it is

60

00:03:47,440  -->  00:03:51,010
_spg. So what we're going to do

61

00:03:51,010  -->  00:03:56,140
is in here we're going to say answer

62

00:03:56,140  -->  00:04:01,269
equals soup.find and we're going to

63

00:04:01,269  -->  00:04:05,739
find_all actually, and we're going to

64

00:04:05,739  -->  00:04:08,260
find everything with the class name

65

00:04:08,260  -->  00:04:16,570
equal to _sPg, and the P there

66

00:04:16,570  -->  00:04:21,190
is capital. Where this is a list, let's

67

00:04:21,190  -->  00:04:26,700
set this to 0, and now this is our answer.

68

00:04:26,700  -->  00:04:31,800
So let's print out answer.text, sorry

69

00:04:31,800  -->  00:04:40,710
get_text, and then let's say self.driver.

70

00:04:40,710  -->  00:04:46,320
quit. Let's rerun this and see what

71

00:04:46,320  -->  00:04:54,590
happens. "How far is Pluto from Earth?"

72

00:05:11,009  -->  00:05:13,979
Alright, interestingly, I think we forgot

73

00:05:13,979  -->  00:05:18,330
to save something. Interestingly, this is

74

00:05:18,330  -->  00:05:26,069
looking up for pie every single time. So,

75

00:05:26,069  -->  00:05:29,369
we got to troubleshoot this a bit, so let

76

00:05:29,369  -->  00:05:33,059
me go ahead and print out self.url and

77

00:05:33,059  -->  00:05:34,289
let's see what we're looking for here,

78

00:05:34,289  -->  00:05:36,809
and I think we made the problem in

79

00:05:36,809  -->  00:05:45,270
commander. No, audio. Well, let's have a

80

00:05:45,270  -->  00:05:51,889
look. "How far is Pluto from Earth?"

81

00:05:58,980  -->  00:06:04,650
There's the problem, alright. The

82

00:06:04,650  -->  00:06:08,070
problem is that the URL we passed in

83

00:06:08,070  -->  00:06:11,880
right here is actually wrong. I'm not

84

00:06:11,880  -->  00:06:15,630
sure why it would use two Q variables, or

85

00:06:15,630  -->  00:06:20,190
if we did that. So, cancel this, there we go.

86

00:06:20,190  -->  00:06:22,230
Save it and run it again, this should

87

00:06:22,230  -->  00:06:28,220
work, I hope. "How far is Pluto from Earth?"

88

00:06:40,950  -->  00:06:43,920
Alright, that is cool, we are done here,

89

00:06:43,920  -->  00:06:46,230
let me cancel out of there. We got the

90

00:06:46,230  -->  00:06:49,920
answer we want. As one final thing, we

91

00:06:49,920  -->  00:06:55,200
want this to to tell us you know what it

92

00:06:55,200  -->  00:06:59,790
is. So what we're going to do is, I think what

93

00:06:59,790  -->  00:07:01,770
we can do is, this right here, let's

94

00:07:01,770  -->  00:07:11,040
return answer.get_text, and then

95

00:07:11,040  -->  00:07:15,330
let's change this from this looking it

96

00:07:15,330  -->  00:07:20,790
up, we're going to change it to, remove

97

00:07:20,790  -->  00:07:22,290
that print statement it's getting a bit

98

00:07:22,290  -->  00:07:25,080
full there, going to jump over here and

99

00:07:25,080  -->  00:07:26,880
here I'm going to say lookup. So we're

100

00:07:26,880  -->  00:07:31,470
going to say answer equals f.lookup,

101

00:07:31,470  -->  00:07:37,620
and then we're going to say respond with

102

00:07:37,620  -->  00:07:45,180
answer, self.respond, actually. So this

103

00:07:45,180  -->  00:07:51,150
should now tell us what basically

104

00:07:51,150  -->  00:07:53,070
whatever we want to know. So let me just

105

00:07:53,070  -->  00:07:56,460
take one final look through here, that

106

00:07:56,460  -->  00:08:04,380
will never be reached, so up there, there

107

00:08:04,380  -->  00:08:05,790
we go. Let's run this and see what

108

00:08:05,790  -->  00:08:14,000
happens. "How far is the Sun from the moon?"

109

00:08:30,180  -->  00:08:32,599
Alright,

110

00:08:32,599  -->  00:08:35,930
so at this point we have a problem with

111

00:08:35,930  -->  00:08:42,889
this string being printed out. Now let me

112

00:08:42,889  -->  00:08:49,220
see why would that do that? It said it

113

00:08:49,220  -->  00:08:52,279
couldn't, unexpected EOF while looking

114

00:08:52,279  -->  00:08:56,300
for matching quote.

115

00:08:56,300  -->  00:09:00,199
Let me jump back over

116

00:09:00,199  -->  00:09:05,959
here and let's try to say that. You know

117

00:09:05,959  -->  00:09:09,170
what I can actually just put that there, let's

118

00:09:09,170  -->  00:09:13,009
try and wrap it manually in quotes maybe,

119

00:09:13,009  -->  00:09:20,800
try it again. "How far is Earth from the Sun?"

120

00:09:34,620  -->  00:09:42,750
Hmm...odd. Let me try that again. "How far is

121

00:09:42,750  -->  00:09:46,280
the moon from Earth?"

122

00:09:58,670  -->  00:10:00,920
I think something's happening with my

123

00:10:00,920  -->  00:10:03,500
internet connection, actually. I might

124

00:10:03,500  -->  00:10:06,560
have to do a bit of troubleshooting

125

00:10:06,560  -->  00:10:08,480
around that and then update you guys

126

00:10:08,480  -->  00:10:11,030
with the next video, and make any other

127

00:10:11,030  -->  00:10:14,690
adjustments we need to make. So, this

128

00:10:14,690  -->  00:10:16,310
should be working, I think it's something

129

00:10:16,310  -->  00:10:18,200
outside of our code itself, hopefully it

130

00:10:18,200  -->  00:10:20,570
works for you guys. I will be back. Join

131

00:10:20,570  -->  00:10:22,370
me in the next video where we will wrap

132

00:10:22,370  -->  00:10:24,820
this up.
