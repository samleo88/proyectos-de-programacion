00:00.210 --> 00:00.900
Brilliant.

00:00.930 --> 00:03.630
We know how to work with background size property.

00:03.630 --> 00:04.880
So what's next.

00:04.900 --> 00:09.630
Then we have the background position and as you can see I already did the misspelling.

00:09.720 --> 00:11.590
So let me make this correct.

00:11.610 --> 00:13.080
And now what we're gonna do.

00:13.590 --> 00:16.620
Well here we're gonna be changing the position of the background image.

00:16.770 --> 00:22.350
And as always it's just gonna be much more easier for us to actually test that out instead of spending

00:22.350 --> 00:24.040
three hours talking about it.

00:24.120 --> 00:28.800
I will gonna do a little bit of spring cleaning though I will gonna get rid of this background repeat

00:29.280 --> 00:32.300
as well as this background size cover for the second one.

00:32.400 --> 00:39.180
I also would like to set background nor repeat for a second guy and we'll get right back on repeat and

00:39.180 --> 00:40.400
we're not going to be repeating.

00:40.890 --> 00:44.030
Now here we're gonna be testing out pretty much everything on a small one.

00:44.340 --> 00:49.440
But once in a while then I check the big one just so we would want to see the differences and let's

00:49.440 --> 00:55.440
say here background we're looking for position and then we have the percentages values the pixel values

00:55.800 --> 00:58.940
but we also have straight up text now for the text.

00:58.950 --> 01:02.740
Let's start with the most basic one which is gonna be exactly in the center.

01:02.760 --> 01:03.870
So if I'm gonna write center.

01:03.870 --> 01:07.520
Notice what happens now the background medium is sitting in the center.

01:07.620 --> 01:12.210
And again the difference between the small one and the big one is that obviously with the small and

01:12.210 --> 01:14.990
we can see where I'm just sitting with the big one.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.430
That image is still gonna be covering the whole div.

01:18.570 --> 01:21.740
However the positioning of the image is going to change.

01:21.840 --> 01:27.750
Now in order to show you that we're going to do background again we're looking for position and then

01:27.750 --> 01:32.070
here we're gonna be placing in the center and now pay attention the moment I'm gonna save it.

01:32.070 --> 01:36.930
The background image is gonna shift a little bit because now this is gonna be the center of the image

01:37.290 --> 01:42.760
and again I'm going to be testing out on both of them because I already we have an idea.

01:42.810 --> 01:47.250
So I'm just going to be testing I'll hold a small one because this is going to be clear where the image

01:47.250 --> 01:48.070
is gonna be sitting.

01:48.210 --> 01:52.300
But just please understand that the same changes would be affected within the big image.

01:52.620 --> 01:57.690
However the difference would be that the big image is still going to be covering the whole div since

01:57.690 --> 02:01.460
obviously we have a background size set to cover.

02:01.640 --> 02:06.420
Now let me save it and now let's look at the other options and you know what maybe let's leave the center

02:06.490 --> 02:11.460
panel just gonna add background position few more time so I'm gonna say back in position and we have

02:11.460 --> 02:14.760
an option of bottom on how this is going to be sitting at the bottom.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.860
I'm going to copy this.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.230
I'm going to say left.

02:17.230 --> 02:23.370
So now the image is gonna be left and we have background position and obviously we have an option of

02:23.370 --> 02:24.300
right.

02:24.360 --> 02:26.490
And sure enough this is gonna be sitting in right.

02:26.700 --> 02:27.780
And then we have the top.

02:28.230 --> 02:34.680
So background position and then we're looking at the top point and sure enough yeah it's sitting here

02:34.680 --> 02:36.000
exactly on top.

02:36.090 --> 02:36.610
All right.

02:36.630 --> 02:37.470
So far so good.

02:37.470 --> 02:40.650
So we have covered the name positioning and you know what.

02:40.650 --> 02:44.910
Maybe let me just make this one smaller because I think we'll going to be able to see everything.

02:45.030 --> 02:50.560
And now I would like to delete them because again you're not gonna be able to see them very clearly

02:50.740 --> 02:54.540
anyway in your text editor if you're looking for suggestions.

02:54.570 --> 02:58.230
So let me delete them and let's work right now with percentages.

02:58.230 --> 02:59.850
Now what's happening with percentages.

02:59.850 --> 03:04.870
We have an option of working with a y value and the x value.

03:05.190 --> 03:10.830
Now that is gonna be obviously the Axis whatever this is gonna be x axis then why X not a beginning

03:10.830 --> 03:12.520
we start again by default.

03:12.570 --> 03:14.150
And that would be 0 0.

03:14.310 --> 03:19.340
So originally if I'm gonna comment this out this is gonna be exactly the same position.

03:19.680 --> 03:22.290
However here we can change these positioning.

03:22.690 --> 03:23.730
So let me again.

03:23.730 --> 03:24.920
I don't know why I'm saying here.

03:25.330 --> 03:32.750
And let's say that I would want to place it 20 percent on the x axis and then 20 percent on the y axis.

03:32.760 --> 03:33.750
So how this is gonna work.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.480
Well I'm going to say 20 percent.

03:36.870 --> 03:38.100
And the moment I'm going to save it.

03:38.100 --> 03:42.020
Notice it moved 20 percent on the x axis.

03:42.060 --> 03:44.760
We also have an option like I said for the y axis.

03:44.760 --> 03:50.460
So if we're going to go 50 percent now this is gonna be 50 percent on a Y axis and that way we can really

03:50.460 --> 03:52.050
manipulate the image.

03:52.050 --> 03:52.890
However we would like.

03:53.330 --> 03:59.270
So if I'm gonna go all the way to 100 let's say something like this and something like this.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.010
This is obviously going to be sitting right up here.

04:02.010 --> 04:08.010
Now I cannot again tell you which exactly properties you're gonna be using throughout this course most

04:08.010 --> 04:12.200
likely all the time we're going to be settling basically for standing in the center.

04:12.240 --> 04:17.130
Now if you don't like how your image looks in the center hours they just understand that you would need

04:17.130 --> 04:20.190
to change the background position and you're gonna be good to go.
