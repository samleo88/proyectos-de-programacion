What's really cool about CSX is the fact that just like with a shim now we don't have to download anything

00:07.270 --> 00:12.110
to start using CSF and we can just start using CSX right away.

00:12.110 --> 00:19.960
In general there are three ways how to start using CSX the inline internal and external CSX.

00:20.180 --> 00:26.870
As a side note in the beginning I'll use a lot of color property because it gives us the best representation

00:27.500 --> 00:32.890
but don't get hung up on the property names or values right now we'll cover them very shortly.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.560
First I would just like to get you a general idea.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.570
So first let's look at inline CSA.

00:38.240 --> 00:43.320
So let's say at the moment we have one heading one bravely sitting on our plate.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.380
Now how I would like to style this.

00:45.390 --> 00:50.070
So let's say I would like that color right now in the Irish demo.

00:50.150 --> 00:54.690
We had a attribute the attribute name was very simply style.

00:54.890 --> 00:57.830
Now again for now please don't get hung up on a syntax.

00:57.950 --> 01:04.100
I would just like to show you how we can add CSX to our page and later on we're going to cover the properties

01:04.100 --> 01:05.480
and values and everything.

01:05.880 --> 01:11.900
So within the style natural beauty I would need to have the quotation marks and then within the quotation

01:11.900 --> 01:14.210
marks and this is where I write my style.

01:14.510 --> 01:16.910
So like I said I would like to have the color.

01:17.060 --> 01:22.220
So I'm going to say color is gonna be as you can see many options I have right away by Visual Studio

01:22.220 --> 01:22.960
code.

01:23.060 --> 01:27.160
So let's go with I don't know can go with all of what I say.

01:27.500 --> 01:32.720
Now I know I said red but for now I just changed my mind and we're going with olive so we're gonna save

01:32.720 --> 01:33.110
it.

01:33.110 --> 01:37.710
And what happens is right away my text is Olive.

01:37.940 --> 01:39.600
So I change my color.

01:39.680 --> 01:45.770
Now all this is great however obviously there are going to be some downsides.

01:46.650 --> 01:52.800
Now what would be the downsides well even though we have the color and everything is looking really

01:52.800 --> 01:53.390
nice.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.980
What happens if I would like more properties so let's say font size.

01:57.270 --> 02:03.900
Now remember we needed to add some my colon and I'm going to say font size and let's go with again three

02:03.900 --> 02:04.450
areas.

02:04.500 --> 02:09.760
And again I know I said this before but please please don't get hung up on the syntax right now.

02:10.070 --> 02:11.910
Well we're going to cover this shortly.

02:11.910 --> 02:14.800
Pretty much you don't have to do anything just watch what's happening.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.250
So let's say here we're adding the font size now as you can see already I just added two properties

02:20.280 --> 02:23.600
but my h the email is getting really clogged up.

02:24.270 --> 02:30.870
And also another issue would be the fact that what if I have another heading to let's say here two and

02:30.900 --> 02:32.920
here I'm going to say hello people.

02:32.970 --> 02:35.790
Now what if I would like to have some success here too.

02:35.790 --> 02:40.860
Does that mean again I'm going to have to create a style attribute and add all these styles as you can

02:40.860 --> 02:47.190
see it gets really annoying because if you're going to have web page normally with let's say 500 elements

02:47.430 --> 02:51.930
what are you going to do for each and every element you're going to be adding this kind of style.

02:51.930 --> 02:53.890
And then what if you will is going to change your mind.

02:53.910 --> 02:58.240
What if you're going to say I don't know I don't feel like all if I feel like red.

02:58.350 --> 03:00.650
So let's head over back and let's say red.

03:00.660 --> 03:04.530
Now for every element that has the olive you're going to be changing back to red.

03:04.650 --> 03:06.740
That is not very practical.

03:06.750 --> 03:13.860
So while in lines yes this is the most basic way how we can add us to our Web page since it has multiple

03:13.860 --> 03:14.870
downsides.

03:14.910 --> 03:17.820
This is probably not something that you going to use very often.
