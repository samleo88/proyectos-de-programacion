00:00.060 --> 00:03.870
Our next project is going to be called Codemasters.

00:03.870 --> 00:05.840
So what we're going to be building over here.

00:06.060 --> 00:09.980
Well first things first you can see that again we're going to have a now.

00:10.150 --> 00:13.100
And so here we're going to have all of them.

00:13.140 --> 00:14.660
These are going to be the links.

00:14.670 --> 00:20.970
And as I'm covering all the links right the color changes here and the background and I know he'll going

00:20.970 --> 00:21.870
to have a font.

00:21.870 --> 00:22.680
Awesome.

00:22.680 --> 00:27.140
All right so the font answer my cousins over here are going to be our social media icons.

00:27.150 --> 00:29.780
However if I go here to the smaller screen.

00:29.790 --> 00:30.540
Right.

00:30.540 --> 00:34.270
First you are going to see that how they see Fluxbox is working right.

00:34.460 --> 00:37.080
Or here you can see that how they're actually rapping.

00:37.190 --> 00:43.380
And if I go to the smaller screen right now we're actually left with only a button right the links are

00:43.380 --> 00:43.910
gone.

00:43.930 --> 00:44.400
Right.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.300
So here now we don't have any phantasms.

00:47.370 --> 00:48.920
We only have the links here.

00:48.970 --> 00:49.360
Right.

00:49.560 --> 00:53.570
So the phantasms are only going to be appearing on the bigger screen.

00:53.600 --> 00:54.400
All right.

00:54.570 --> 00:59.810
We're going to look at how we can create this effect where actually once we click the button or here

00:59.830 --> 01:03.660
right you can see that actually the links are here right.

01:03.660 --> 01:05.990
You can see that the bars are changing.

01:06.190 --> 01:08.270
All right so it's not just clicking the button.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.490
Nothing is happening.

01:09.550 --> 01:13.850
But over here you can see that these bars are transforming.

01:14.160 --> 01:18.510
And once we're done with the number few more things that we can actually add.

01:18.510 --> 01:18.970
All right.

01:19.190 --> 01:21.510
So we're scrolling down.

01:21.510 --> 01:21.990
You can see it.

01:22.020 --> 01:24.480
We're going to look at how we can have this effect.

01:24.480 --> 01:24.910
All right.

01:24.940 --> 01:29.360
Well there's going to be a darker background all right for the home bar.

01:29.610 --> 01:32.280
And also we're going to have a smooth scrolling.

01:32.370 --> 01:38.940
So if I press over here you can see that it's going to scroll to skills that is going to scroll to about

01:39.470 --> 01:44.210
and are we're going to have a project and all of this is going to be pretty.

01:44.280 --> 01:44.560
All right.

01:44.600 --> 01:52.710
So basically when I look at how we can use a smooth scrolling and also how we can how to here this background

01:52.710 --> 01:59.010
for the number only when it's at a certain point in our document then after that we're going to have

01:59.100 --> 02:05.100
a banner around here where we're actually going to look at how we can create a card like this.

02:05.100 --> 02:05.770
Right.

02:05.790 --> 02:07.600
This is going to be the name over here.

02:07.700 --> 02:11.100
And then this is going to be on here our skills section.

02:11.100 --> 02:15.820
We're going to look at how we can create these kind of borders here and this right.

02:16.050 --> 02:20.000
And you can see that we're going to be using a C Ss fluxbox.

02:20.040 --> 02:24.360
And since it's great to actually get them side by side.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.290
Now the borders are only going to be appearing on the bigger screen.

02:27.300 --> 02:27.860
Right.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.210
But you can see that it's still going to be responsive.

02:30.210 --> 02:35.550
So if I got the smaller screen right you can see that there are going to be one and after that once

02:35.730 --> 02:37.410
we got to the bigger screen right.

02:37.410 --> 02:39.590
Actually two of them side by side.

02:39.630 --> 02:45.830
Then after that we're going to look at a clip path of how we can create or hear this type of image right.

02:45.840 --> 02:49.560
So the image is in the background then we have side by side next door here.

02:49.560 --> 02:56.570
However right now the image actually has a border shape right so I'm starting to slant it right.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.420
So it's not straight up it's actually slanted.

02:59.550 --> 03:03.780
And after that we're going to use a grid to create this kind of effect.

03:03.780 --> 03:04.260
Right.

03:04.290 --> 03:08.130
So you can see they're We're going to have a masonry effect but you can see that it's not going to be

03:08.130 --> 03:09.910
straight up even just side by side.

03:09.930 --> 03:10.570
Right.

03:10.590 --> 03:16.560
We're going to look at actually how we can create this type of masonry where the images are changing

03:16.560 --> 03:20.150
the size right and changing that with this right.

03:20.190 --> 03:25.150
Also some of the images right you can see that we're going to have these background effect right.

03:25.250 --> 03:30.270
Or basically as was crawling up and down right you can see the image states now but it's not the case

03:30.270 --> 03:31.090
for all.

03:31.380 --> 03:36.000
And obviously a very basic one as we're hovering right the capacity is going to change.

03:36.190 --> 03:41.970
Then after that this is going to be our team members section and over here we're going to be implementing

03:42.090 --> 03:43.730
a J.A.G. carousel.

03:43.770 --> 03:44.350
Right.

03:44.360 --> 03:49.950
And on here we're going to look at how it looks when let's say all five items on a bigger screen.

03:49.960 --> 03:50.410
Right.

03:50.550 --> 03:56.150
Because by default that AJ query how plug in actually is responsive.

03:56.190 --> 03:59.340
All right so what's happening that if we go let's say them the small screen.

03:59.490 --> 04:05.640
We only have three of them right and we're not going to be using a C Ss fluxbox for right or great.

04:05.670 --> 04:07.740
It's actually going to be built in Jake.

04:07.750 --> 04:08.750
All right.

04:08.790 --> 04:13.610
And also we're going to look at how we can style these buttons right to the colors that we want.

04:13.620 --> 04:14.050
Right.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.700
And you can see or hear a lot of Crusoe's work.

04:16.920 --> 04:22.200
And if we're actually going to go to the small screen right then we're going to have a single element

04:22.500 --> 04:22.970
like this.

04:23.010 --> 04:23.540
Right.

04:23.580 --> 04:27.430
So this is how we can actually do this with our Carrousel.

04:27.480 --> 04:32.100
Then after that what we would want to do is repeat with an hour kaso right.

04:32.250 --> 04:35.690
Here actually going to have a less items here.

04:35.700 --> 04:36.220
Right.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.570
So there's is only going to be three of them like this.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.960
And you can see we're going to make a card.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.490
This is going to be fun.

04:43.680 --> 04:47.190
We're going to look at how we can place image all the way in the bottom here.

04:47.190 --> 04:47.770
Right.

04:47.790 --> 04:49.150
So it's all the card.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.660
And as you can see over here this is going to be the background.

04:51.690 --> 04:52.040
Right.

04:52.200 --> 04:58.080
But the difference again this is going to have less or here our carso items right.

04:58.080 --> 05:02.340
So this is not going to have five real it over here we looked at five.

05:02.340 --> 05:04.830
Here we're going to look at three of them.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.180
None of them that we don't have a form.

05:08.380 --> 05:10.160
We're going to have a contact over here.

05:10.160 --> 05:10.550
Right.

05:10.550 --> 05:13.110
And this is going to be the input elements over here.

05:13.170 --> 05:13.900
Right.

05:13.940 --> 05:17.380
This is going to be our text area and or here on the left hand side.

05:17.380 --> 05:19.330
This is going to be our contact information.
