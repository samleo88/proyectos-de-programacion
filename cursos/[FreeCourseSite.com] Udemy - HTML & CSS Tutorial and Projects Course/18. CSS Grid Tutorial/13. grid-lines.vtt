00:00.740 --> 00:06.860
Once we have looked at the developer tools next one on one and we cover the grid lines that we already

00:06.860 --> 00:09.220
looked at in the previous video.

00:09.290 --> 00:16.040
First and foremost not only in the browser but also in my actual set of files as well as the current

00:16.040 --> 00:16.980
working project.

00:17.300 --> 00:24.720
I'm gonna add a margin all around for a container just so we can see a bit clear our grid lines.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.600
So it's going to look something like that.

00:27.810 --> 00:34.370
So I added margin all around and we could technically head over again back to our project and just check

00:34.370 --> 00:39.120
it out the grid lines but I would just like to show you the resources that you can use.

00:39.250 --> 00:46.250
So within a browser I just type see us as grid and then we're going to click on the images and you're

00:46.250 --> 00:49.450
going to see a bunch of very very useful images.

00:49.580 --> 00:55.480
And again we're just gonna keep on scrolling and we're gonna notice the image that I like the most.

00:55.490 --> 00:59.480
So let me grab this image and that's not what I wanted to do.

00:59.990 --> 01:02.320
So let me roll over back and let me zoom in.

01:02.900 --> 01:09.710
So I would like to point out right now is the fact that as we're working with the grid we have a grid

01:09.710 --> 01:13.340
container so that is of course our parent container.

01:13.340 --> 01:16.130
And then of course we have our grid lines.

01:16.280 --> 01:21.780
So we have grid lines for the columns as well as we have the grid lines for the rows.

01:21.830 --> 01:27.860
So these would be the grid lines for the rows and then these ones would be for the columns.

01:27.940 --> 01:31.270
Then we also have something called track.

01:31.340 --> 01:37.370
So whether that will be horizontal track then we are talking about the road track as well as for the

01:37.370 --> 01:39.630
columns we have the contra.

01:39.680 --> 01:44.160
So I will be this thing when we have grid cells and that would be our track.

01:44.340 --> 01:50.490
And then of course we're also going to have the grid area which again we're going to cover just inside.

01:50.870 --> 01:55.840
So this just gives you an idea that if you don't like my explanations then I'm going to use the number

01:55.840 --> 01:56.490
either.

01:56.570 --> 02:04.010
You can always always head over back to a web and you can find whatever image or visual explanation

02:04.310 --> 02:06.510
that you actually enjoy the most.

02:06.830 --> 02:13.430
So you can also use maybe this one where again we have the cell and we have a track and then we have

02:13.430 --> 02:16.580
the area me close it for now.

02:17.150 --> 02:18.320
Let's close this guy.

02:18.320 --> 02:22.950
And then once we had over back to our project again we have our lines.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.190
So we have the com lines starting from one and two then three and four and the more columns you want

02:31.190 --> 02:33.070
to add all the more lines.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.890
I'm going to have as well.

02:35.180 --> 02:41.090
So have three columns and then of course it ends with a line number four for my columns.

02:41.090 --> 02:44.640
So the same works with a rose I have three rows.

02:44.710 --> 02:49.420
That's the reason why it ends with a number for now.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.130
Now that we know that we have those lines.

02:52.130 --> 02:57.230
Let's take a look at how we can use them by in fact rearranging our grid.

02:57.260 --> 03:07.150
So let's imagine the scenario where I would like my first cell to be spanning all the way from the column

03:07.150 --> 03:12.310
line one to a column line number three like cell.

03:12.370 --> 03:16.080
And I also like to use the second row as well.

03:16.210 --> 03:24.800
So I would like to have my cell spanning from the wrong number one to a row line number three.

03:24.820 --> 03:28.140
So I would want it to be spanning in the second row.

03:28.210 --> 03:33.260
So the way we do that is first all we need to target the individual cell.

03:33.410 --> 03:36.370
And that's the reason why we added here this class as well.

03:36.370 --> 03:41.380
So let's target this particular cell and then the properties are following.

03:41.380 --> 03:47.310
So we have a grid column and then we have the end and the start.

03:47.350 --> 03:52.080
Now I'm going to show you also the shorter later on but let's just start the long way.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.600
We have grid columns start.

03:53.890 --> 03:56.770
So let's say you know what I'm going to start with.

03:56.770 --> 04:01.220
Let's say a grid column line number one correct.

04:01.420 --> 04:06.880
Then I would want a grid column and then we say well where would want to end.

04:07.360 --> 04:13.050
So it's really up to us currently it ends with a column line of two.

04:13.060 --> 04:16.600
Now I could end it at three and four.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.240
It's really up to me.

04:18.400 --> 04:25.990
So I'm going to go with let's say three and the moment we do that right away myself spans now automatically

04:25.990 --> 04:31.840
again we're just shifting the Arabs notice once we have seven items we have three rows and now we just

04:31.840 --> 04:33.300
move the rest of the Arabs.

04:33.430 --> 04:39.100
So cell number two right now are sitting here where the cells number three was and all the way up to

04:39.160 --> 04:41.240
a cell number seven.

04:41.250 --> 04:48.850
Now I also like to in fact use this to span my cell in a second row.

04:48.850 --> 04:50.070
Can we do that.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.240
Well of course we can.

04:51.250 --> 04:55.370
So we have grid row then we have again start.

04:55.420 --> 05:03.260
So we're gonna start with number one like so and then we have grid rule and then we go with end.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.560
So where it should end.

05:04.630 --> 05:12.750
Again remember the lines were four rows one then this guy was number two then three and then four.

05:12.760 --> 05:17.320
So it's really up to you where you would want this particular column to span.

05:17.410 --> 05:21.980
So I'm gonna go you know what I would like it to span two rows.

05:22.120 --> 05:28.060
So I'm gonna say that my grade Roland is going to be equal to three and check it out.

05:28.390 --> 05:35.680
Now we have my cell that is spanning in fact two columns as well as two rows and we can do that by using

05:35.680 --> 05:39.730
the fact that we have numbers for our columns.

05:39.730 --> 05:46.540
We have lines that have numbers for our columns as well as for our particular rows.

05:46.540 --> 05:52.240
Now let's imagine that I would want my cell cell number four to span all across.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.030
But you not before we do that.

05:54.040 --> 06:01.630
Why don't I show you the shortcut so we could also write it like this so grid column and then we have

06:01.930 --> 06:08.560
the first line so where it should start and then we have a forward slash and then we add here where

06:08.560 --> 06:14.740
we would want our cell to end and which column and that's the reason why we had one and then forward

06:14.740 --> 06:15.490
slash three.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.680
Again this is exactly what we wrote before.

06:18.850 --> 06:25.420
This is just a bit of a shorthand and you can probably already guess that if we're going to write a

06:25.420 --> 06:30.490
grid row then of course we're going to also have a want three.

06:30.550 --> 06:34.270
So where it starts forward slash and where it ends.

06:34.300 --> 06:39.400
Now I'm going to come on this out just so I can see the long way as well but the moment will be saved

06:39.730 --> 06:42.100
of course nothing changes.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.370
Now I also would like to point it out.

06:44.410 --> 06:45.400
Two things.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.670
First of all we can use the negative values.

06:47.680 --> 06:53.500
Remember I also mentioned that where if we're checking this out we notice that we have negative values

06:53.500 --> 06:53.940
here.

06:54.070 --> 06:56.410
We have one two three four.

06:56.470 --> 06:58.180
Those would be my column lines.

06:58.300 --> 07:03.730
Then I also have negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 and negative 4.

07:04.120 --> 07:11.880
So what if let's say I would want my cell number for the span all across this row.

07:11.940 --> 07:14.200
Now I could say something like this.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.900
I could say cell four.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.760
I know it's sitting in let's say row number three correct.

07:20.770 --> 07:28.360
Because remember now again we are doing the same thing where we are creating the implicit grid because

07:28.360 --> 07:35.230
even though our normal layout was three columns and three rows in fact the cell number four is sitting

07:35.230 --> 07:36.220
in a third row.

07:36.220 --> 07:38.070
But we right away have already.

07:38.070 --> 07:44.980
The fourth row now that particular fourth row is already implicit and we can tell that because we don't

07:44.980 --> 07:46.350
have any numbers here.

07:46.360 --> 07:50.200
Notice there is no numbers here because we're just creating right away.

07:50.350 --> 07:52.110
Our implicit great.

07:52.230 --> 08:01.750
Now back to our task where I would like to span from this cell for an hour one Hispanic from the column

08:01.750 --> 08:05.120
line number 1 all the way to the end of the column.

08:05.390 --> 08:09.870
Let's say that it's hard for me to actually count how many lines I have.

08:09.870 --> 08:11.000
I can be like you know what.

08:11.100 --> 08:12.890
I just cannot bother counting.

08:13.050 --> 08:17.610
Well I could write a great column and then remembered a shortcut.

08:17.700 --> 08:23.360
We had a one so it's gonna start with one and then forward slash and we would want to end it.

08:23.640 --> 08:26.800
Negative 1 y negative 1 0.

08:26.820 --> 08:28.280
That would be our last one correct.

08:28.590 --> 08:31.070
So let's say we don't want to count the four.

08:31.140 --> 08:34.310
So you're not span all across to a negative four.

08:34.560 --> 08:35.620
Not saying that.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.770
And there you go.

08:36.820 --> 08:40.390
And this is something that it would be impossible to do.

08:40.410 --> 08:47.370
In fact with a 4 x marks because as we're working with Flex bars again flex box is very powerful like

08:47.390 --> 08:48.820
box is very great.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.260
I'm not dissing right now on the Flex box.

08:51.420 --> 08:57.120
What I'm saying is when we're using the Flex box we were limited to only working in one dimensional

08:57.120 --> 09:01.890
layout whether that would be a horizontal or vertical.

09:01.890 --> 09:08.550
Now in this case what happens in fact with a C is as great is that we're not limited to that by a very

09:08.550 --> 09:11.190
simple example when we're using grid lines.

09:11.190 --> 09:18.630
Notice how powerful it is to create this type of layout and in fact how easy it is to create this kind

09:18.630 --> 09:19.190
of layout.

09:19.440 --> 09:23.760
Even if we're just knowing the basic facts about the grid lines.
