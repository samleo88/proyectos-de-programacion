WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:01.540
Excellent guys.

00:01.590 --> 00:08.490
Once we have created more pages for our project now we have Holmes skills about and product before we

00:08.490 --> 00:10.620
deploy our Web site online.

00:10.620 --> 00:16.590
In fact I changed my mind and I decided to add one more section to our project.

00:16.590 --> 00:20.700
Now you can obviously later on create a one more page if you would like to.

00:20.700 --> 00:25.440
But in my case I'm just gonna add this particular section on our homepage.

00:25.680 --> 00:32.310
Now the purpose for this section is going to be show you how we can create in fact cards using HRT amounts

00:32.310 --> 00:39.060
we assess and how also we can use float to in fact manage them on different screen sizes.

00:39.180 --> 00:46.140
So if we're going to make our project smaller you're going to notice that we're gonna have one card

00:46.440 --> 00:52.770
on the extra small screen size and then as I'm making these screen size bigger then I'm gonna have a

00:52.770 --> 00:57.210
two card layout and then later on of course I'm gonna have a three card layout.

00:57.630 --> 01:02.880
So in this case we're going to use a little bit of different syntax where previously when we used floats

01:03.300 --> 01:05.140
we just use the padding.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.830
In this case we're going to implement margin as well.

01:07.830 --> 01:08.500
All right.

01:08.580 --> 01:09.910
Now that's the plan.

01:09.990 --> 01:13.240
So why don't we start working on it one by one.

01:13.240 --> 01:18.410
All right now we're going to start very simply by looking for the product or the contact section.

01:18.420 --> 01:20.910
Now the easiest one probably is going to be contact.

01:21.120 --> 01:27.810
And in order for you to help you to navigate there you can also use always command and if not common

01:27.810 --> 01:31.910
enough is going to give you this little search bar and then just type here.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.450
Let's say contact.

01:33.450 --> 01:36.790
This is gonna help find this particular section.

01:36.930 --> 01:42.750
As you can see it gives me pretty much all the instances of contact which leads me to the contact section

01:43.380 --> 01:46.290
and in between the product and contact section.

01:46.470 --> 01:53.470
I'm going to create my in fact comment where I'm gonna say services.

01:53.520 --> 01:54.540
OK.

01:54.630 --> 01:55.940
Copy and pasted.

01:55.980 --> 01:58.670
Let's say and of services.

01:58.830 --> 02:05.990
And then within the services let's start very simply by typing section then class name of course.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.680
And let's write services.

02:07.740 --> 02:11.310
So that is the class name for my services section.

02:11.310 --> 02:18.930
Then I would want a title and remember when we were working on the products we already had some kind

02:18.930 --> 02:19.660
of title.

02:19.740 --> 02:25.840
So the only thing we need to do is just scroll up and then let's look for our title.

02:25.840 --> 02:32.820
And you're probably noticing that right after these products in full while we do the have a section

02:32.820 --> 02:33.650
title.

02:34.140 --> 02:40.350
So let's just grab everything starting from the beginning comment to the uncommon and let's again scroll

02:40.350 --> 02:45.430
down and we're just gonna copy and paste it within these services.

02:45.450 --> 02:50.040
Now there's few things that we like to do for this particular title.

02:50.070 --> 02:55.610
So once we save it we do have our title displayed but I would like to add some changes.

02:55.740 --> 02:59.350
So first and foremost when we have the div the enclosing div.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.680
Why don't we add a few classes.

03:01.680 --> 03:05.800
So let's write class then let's write services.

03:06.170 --> 03:09.940
Title that's gonna be the class that we're going to create in the second.

03:10.290 --> 03:15.420
But also I'm going to implement the right away the class that we already created before by the name

03:15.420 --> 03:16.680
of text center.

03:16.680 --> 03:20.620
So this particular class just aligns text innocent.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.950
Now if you're wondering where's that class.

03:22.950 --> 03:30.000
Again you can use the command if you have a search bar and either you look for helpers I believe that

03:30.000 --> 03:36.300
was the actual comment or my utility classes or you can just look for the class itself not the class

03:36.300 --> 03:44.580
name or text center like so and you notice that the C assess is text on line property and the value

03:44.670 --> 03:51.480
is center and that's the reason why right now my title text is in fact sitting in the center.

03:51.480 --> 04:00.200
Then let's change also the value for having three I'm going to say explore explore and find the actual

04:00.200 --> 04:09.600
text for the adding to it is going to be our services now like so then lastly let's remove this text

04:09.600 --> 04:17.340
white because I think it's gonna look a little bit better if we just have this black stack then once

04:17.340 --> 04:23.850
we have a title that's all done and we're gonna by the way work on the services title class a little

04:23.850 --> 04:26.460
bit later on when we work now she says.

04:26.460 --> 04:32.250
So for now we're just gonna leave it blank and land right after D section title that's still within

04:32.250 --> 04:40.920
the section class I'm gonna create a div with two classes that we already created before 1 4 section

04:40.920 --> 04:50.170
Center and the other one for clear fix so let's write div section center as well as the clear fix and

04:50.340 --> 04:55.320
one by one again let's look at these two classes just so we're not unclear confused.

04:55.410 --> 05:02.250
So first of all we have our clear fix that is because we are going gonna use floats in order to again

05:03.180 --> 05:09.420
have our layout so we're gonna use floats and in order to make sure that everything sits correctly we

05:09.420 --> 05:11.440
need to use our clear fix.

05:11.520 --> 05:18.190
So we're making sure that everything before and after our clear fix is in fact cleared.

05:18.450 --> 05:25.250
So that's the reason why we're using this code content of empty string then clear both and display a

05:25.260 --> 05:32.960
table that's number one for the clear fix as far as the section center again let's look for her class

05:33.200 --> 05:35.810
section center.

05:35.820 --> 05:40.700
And you're going to notice that we're adding the padding top and bottom for our arms.

05:40.910 --> 05:45.180
Then zero on right and left as well as the width.

05:45.260 --> 05:52.760
So we set up already some kind of with for our section and the width is going to be 80 percent of the

05:52.760 --> 05:53.940
size of the window.

05:54.110 --> 06:00.280
Regardless whether that's desktop or the mobile phone and of course we're also setting up right away

06:00.290 --> 06:07.700
the max with OK where we have Max width of eleven hundred seventy pixels and that margin is zero top

06:07.700 --> 06:09.920
bottom and left and right arm.

06:10.060 --> 06:16.160
That's the reason once we save the indexation email since we added both classes we should have something

06:16.160 --> 06:23.250
like this nice so where we have the title then we already have some at this base because of our paddocks.

06:23.540 --> 06:31.010
Now within this particular div the section center first of all I'm going to add comments of single card

06:31.790 --> 06:36.310
copy pasted let's add and of single card.

06:36.560 --> 06:40.940
And then within this card let's create a div name or not.

06:40.940 --> 06:43.850
Now when do we add an article instead.

06:43.980 --> 06:46.440
And that's gonna be a little bit more meaningful.

06:46.520 --> 06:55.190
So let's write Oracle now for the particular article I'm gonna add a class of service card like so.

06:55.310 --> 07:01.010
And let me make sure that I'm adding only one hyphen because that's the only thing I would want.

07:01.100 --> 07:04.800
And then let's add one more comment of image container.

07:04.820 --> 07:10.400
Now one thing we need to understand about the cards when we're sending them the cards is two components

07:10.430 --> 07:12.830
that in fact make up that card.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.220
Now one is the image.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.630
So in most cases you're going to need some kind of image.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.730
And second one is going to be text.

07:19.730 --> 07:27.720
Now there's gonna be some cases where you would want to add some additional things where your image

07:27.720 --> 07:28.460
is sitting.

07:28.490 --> 07:32.670
So that's the reason why we are going to create a image container.

07:32.810 --> 07:38.580
Because in fact we would want to place this icon in this exact position.

07:38.750 --> 07:39.040
All right.

07:39.350 --> 07:45.530
So if we wouldn't want to have the icon or if we would want to have some I don't know text that we are

07:45.530 --> 07:47.510
hovering over or anything like that.

07:47.630 --> 07:50.800
In fact you could just get away by using the image.

07:51.140 --> 07:56.630
So please remember that the reason why I'm creating this image container is simply because I'm going

07:56.630 --> 08:00.080
to have some additional things where the image is sitting.

08:00.090 --> 08:00.610
OK.

08:00.650 --> 08:05.300
If I wouldn't have that now I could just get away by using the simple image.

08:05.300 --> 08:10.430
So I'm going to have my image container and then within the image container and by the way first of

08:10.430 --> 08:15.650
all I guess first let's create it and I'm gonna have the class for this particular container by the

08:15.650 --> 08:19.730
class of service image container.

08:19.910 --> 08:25.760
And this is also something that I would like to talk about where as your project gets bigger you're

08:25.760 --> 08:31.250
going to have to start managing your classes online because again please understand we had just have

08:31.250 --> 08:37.160
one homepage currently but as you're gonna be adding more content let's say you're gonna have one image

08:37.160 --> 08:37.950
container.

08:37.970 --> 08:43.670
Now if you're already using this particular class somewhere well you're already going to have some styles.

08:43.790 --> 08:49.610
So you need to make sure that as you're creating more content you are being very very specific about

08:49.610 --> 08:54.860
your class names because probably you wouldn't want to create 10 image containers and then have some

08:54.860 --> 09:00.980
kind of random styles in there because each and every one of them is going to be overriding the other

09:00.980 --> 09:01.630
ones.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.880
So it just doesn't make sense.

09:03.890 --> 09:08.300
So make sure that you have some kind of unique name to my case is going to be service.

09:08.380 --> 09:13.420
I have an image container and then within the image contained there's going to be two things.

09:13.490 --> 09:15.380
First there's going to be an image.

09:15.410 --> 09:20.550
And second we're going to have these service icon now for the time being I'm not going to place the

09:20.540 --> 09:23.990
service icon because I would like to do this step by step.

09:24.080 --> 09:28.580
So I'm just going to have the comment where eventually we're going to place a service icon.

09:29.090 --> 09:35.810
Now as for the image I'm going to have the image tags then within the source I'm not going to add any

09:35.810 --> 09:38.990
extra images because I already have for the product.

09:38.990 --> 09:45.800
Now I can always add them myself but in my case I'm just going to look for product number one and then

09:45.800 --> 09:47.030
let's do the right away.

09:47.030 --> 09:50.320
Class of service image.

09:50.780 --> 09:55.490
Now I can tell you right away the image is gonna be huge now because there's gonna be some CEO says

09:55.490 --> 10:01.390
that we are gonna have to add in order for the image to be with of hundred percent.

10:01.790 --> 10:06.950
Otherwise it's gonna have just it's with a height which is going to be massive.

10:06.980 --> 10:15.980
Now as far as alternative when we write single service single service like so and then like I said service

10:16.040 --> 10:18.920
icon we're going to leave blank for now.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.050
So let's just leave the comments on.

10:21.070 --> 10:26.700
Like I said we have our massive image because we do need to add a little bit of styling there right

10:27.290 --> 10:29.860
now right after the image container.

10:29.900 --> 10:35.660
So not within the image container but right after the image container we're going to have another div

10:35.900 --> 10:38.280
by the class name of service info.

10:38.300 --> 10:49.040
So let's add a comment of service info like so and then let's create our live with the same class.

10:49.040 --> 10:58.420
So service inform and then within this of why don't we have a hearing for now.

10:58.420 --> 11:03.660
The heading for is going to have a class name for the service in full title.

11:03.710 --> 11:04.540
Are you not.

11:04.630 --> 11:07.730
Actually we can skip that don't bother.

11:07.810 --> 11:12.720
We can just have a hearing for we're going to add all our classes here within the service.

11:12.730 --> 11:13.860
For more I'm sorry.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.580
All our styles.

11:15.580 --> 11:25.620
So let's write custom custom recipes and for the time being in fact we're gonna add only one card so

11:25.620 --> 11:27.260
we're gonna add only one card.

11:27.420 --> 11:32.970
We're gonna properly style it and then in fact we're gonna have the rest of the cards as well as use

11:32.970 --> 11:33.910
the floats.

11:34.320 --> 11:39.760
Now the way I set up my layout is in fact where I do have my heading for.

11:39.960 --> 11:43.980
But I would like to have the second line with a text of service.

11:44.210 --> 11:50.070
So I'm going to have my first line and then the second line and the way I decided to do that is in fact

11:50.070 --> 11:51.420
using the line break.

11:51.450 --> 11:53.100
Now it's really up to you.

11:53.190 --> 11:53.670
You can do it.

11:53.670 --> 11:54.320
How are you like.

11:54.330 --> 11:55.810
You can also do it this way.

11:56.200 --> 12:05.970
Well you have a ring for and we just write let's say service you know what was deleted here for custom

12:06.340 --> 12:08.190
and let's just write service.

12:08.190 --> 12:10.860
We could do it this way by the way.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.550
As you can see that's going to be my result here.

12:13.690 --> 12:15.780
Or we can use a line break.

12:15.890 --> 12:22.470
So we're within the heading for just going to have a line break and then I'm just writing whatever I

12:22.470 --> 12:23.020
would like.

12:23.070 --> 12:25.190
So I could have done it also this way.

12:25.190 --> 12:27.210
It's really up to you.

12:27.390 --> 12:27.600
Yeah.

12:27.600 --> 12:34.230
Again I think I'm gonna use a two hand enforce I guess not just leave it the way it is for now and then

12:34.230 --> 12:40.220
also right after resetting second heading for I I'd like to have a button.

12:40.410 --> 12:48.090
Now the button is just gonna be a simple button so let's write type Martin and then let's add a class

12:48.150 --> 12:57.480
of service button so let's write class service between now and then within the button let's write to

12:57.480 --> 12:58.940
read more.

12:59.670 --> 13:03.090
Let's save that and that is going to be our single card.

13:03.430 --> 13:03.700
All right.

13:04.020 --> 13:09.390
So like I said we're going to add some styles for this one particular single card.

13:09.390 --> 13:15.810
Then we're going to use floats to in fact place them side by side and then we're going to work on our

13:15.810 --> 13:20.550
icons so our icons are going to be the last thing that we're going to work on.
