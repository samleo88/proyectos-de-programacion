1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,120
Alright, so, we got maybe two videos

2

00:00:03,120  -->  00:00:06,569
left in this specific project, and I just

3

00:00:06,569  -->  00:00:08,160
want to cover a few more things just to

4

00:00:08,160  -->  00:00:10,200
make it feel semi complete. I do want to

5

00:00:10,200  -->  00:00:12,059
mention though and this is something I'm

6

00:00:12,059  -->  00:00:14,730
not going to be doing, but if you watch

7

00:00:14,730  -->  00:00:17,039
the videos, or if you do watch the videos

8

00:00:17,039  -->  00:00:19,199
not really sure where they are in the course, but

9

00:00:19,199  -->  00:00:21,810
there are videos dedicated to using

10

00:00:21,810  -->  00:00:27,390
JSON which is basically a way to save

11

00:00:27,390  -->  00:00:29,970
data and then load data from a file. What you could

12

00:00:29,970  -->  00:00:32,189
do and I would be really interested in

13

00:00:32,189  -->  00:00:33,870
seeing this, I would like to do it myself

14

00:00:33,870  -->  00:00:35,070
but I don't think we're going to have

15

00:00:35,070  -->  00:00:38,969
time to venture onto that, but if you

16

00:00:38,969  -->  00:00:40,649
guys want to do it and send me a link

17

00:00:40,649  -->  00:00:43,379
what I think would be really cool if you

18

00:00:43,379  -->  00:00:45,149
could at the beginning of the script

19

00:00:45,149  -->  00:00:47,489
here try to load a save file. So, let's

20

00:00:47,489  -->  00:00:50,640
say you had a file called save.json

21

00:00:50,640  -->  00:00:53,670
and the save would contain a character's

22

00:00:53,670  -->  00:00:56,610
name, hitpoints, you know all the stats,

23

00:00:56,610  -->  00:00:58,829
and also experience points. You can

24

00:00:58,829  -->  00:01:01,199
create a leveling system where your

25

00:01:01,199  -->  00:01:03,629
characters could actually level up, and

26

00:01:03,629  -->  00:01:06,390
you could create a ton of enemies, and

27

00:01:06,390  -->  00:01:10,170
then randomly you know basically what

28

00:01:10,170  -->  00:01:12,450
you would do is for each battle the

29

00:01:12,450  -->  00:01:14,490
players would get experience points and

30

00:01:14,490  -->  00:01:15,840
then after each battle you would have the

31

00:01:15,840  -->  00:01:17,700
option to save back into that json file,

32

00:01:17,700  -->  00:01:19,860
and then also continue on to other

33

00:01:19,860  -->  00:01:21,900
battles. What you could do is make a

34

00:01:21,900  -->  00:01:24,330
list of let's say 50 different enemies,

35

00:01:24,330  -->  00:01:27,299
and then in each battle determine you

36

00:01:27,299  -->  00:01:29,189
know two or three enemies to throw into

37

00:01:29,189  -->  00:01:32,640
that battle, and also makes the enemy's

38

00:01:32,640  -->  00:01:37,619
data scale to these guys levels. So, that

39

00:01:37,619  -->  00:01:39,479
is a bit complicated and it would be

40

00:01:39,479  -->  00:01:41,880
tedious to watch me do it because it's

41

00:01:41,880  -->  00:01:43,320
just gonna be covering a lot of the

42

00:01:43,320  -->  00:01:45,509
stuff that we've already learned, and I

43

00:01:45,509  -->  00:01:47,820
think this specific project has already

44

00:01:47,820  -->  00:01:49,799
gotten too long. So, I just want to finish it

45

00:01:49,799  -->  00:01:52,200
up at this point, get it done, and we can

46

00:01:52,200  -->  00:01:54,540
move on to some other fun stuff.

47

00:01:54,540  -->  00:01:56,640
So, what we're going to be doing I

48

00:01:56,640  -->  00:01:57,750
believe we're at this point right now

49

00:01:57,750  -->  00:02:00,420
where one enemy attacks, so we need to

50

00:02:00,420  -->  00:02:02,100
make all enemies attack but we also need

51

00:02:02,100  -->  00:02:04,829
to code this into somewhat intelligent

52

00:02:04,829  -->  00:02:08,429
attacks, and give them a cure spell, maybe

53

00:02:08,429  -->  00:02:11,039
some potions, and allow them

54

00:02:11,039  -->  00:02:13,590
to heal if needed and that's going to

55

00:02:13,590  -->  00:02:15,090
make the battle a lot more challenging.

56

00:02:15,090  -->  00:02:19,709
So, what we're going to do is right here we're

57

00:02:19,709  -->  00:02:24,989
going to say for enemy in enemies: so

58

00:02:24,989  -->  00:02:29,069
first we need to indent this bit right

59

00:02:29,069  -->  00:02:35,310
here because that's what wwe're working with. So, we need

60

00:02:35,310  -->  00:02:38,730
to generate an enemy choice between 0

61

00:02:38,730  -->  00:02:46,530
and 3. So, random.randrange

62

00:02:46,530  -->  00:02:53,970
between 0 &amp; 3, and then what we need to do

63

00:02:53,970  -->  00:02:58,620
obviously is 0 is going to be attack, 2

64

00:02:58,620  -->  00:03:01,409
is going to be magic, and three is going to be

65

00:03:01,409  -->  00:03:09,569
item. So, what we can actually do is copy a

66

00:03:09,569  -->  00:03:15,629
bit of this. So, actually, this is

67

00:03:15,629  -->  00:03:17,069
unnecessary because we've already got

68

00:03:17,069  -->  00:03:23,940
that coded, so if enemy_choice == 0:

69

00:03:23,940  -->  00:03:32,159
we're going to print the enemy's name. So,

70

00:03:32,159  -->  00:03:39,959
let's say enemy.name.replace,

71

00:03:39,959  -->  00:03:43,739
I'm going to replace all spaces with a blank

72

00:03:43,739  -->  00:03:49,709
character, I'm going to say attacks for and then enemy damage.

73

00:03:49,709  -->  00:03:58,460
Actually, they attack player. So,

74

00:03:58,460  -->  00:04:00,800
we're going out the player's name as

75

00:04:00,800  -->  00:04:07,070
well. So players(target).name, and then we're going

76

00:04:07,070  -->  00:04:13,370
to replace all spaces with that. So that's

77

00:04:13,370  -->  00:04:15,440
just the attack itself and what we need

78

00:04:15,440  -->  00:04:17,060
to do is we need to put this bit of code

79

00:04:17,060  -->  00:04:23,300
before our enemies so that if we have no

80

00:04:23,300  -->  00:04:25,400
enemies left, if we've just killed

81

00:04:25,400  -->  00:04:26,030
them,

82

00:04:26,030  -->  00:04:27,650
obviously they can't attack, and that's the error

83

00:04:27,650  -->  00:04:31,130
we were getting in the last video.

84

00:04:31,130  -->  00:04:38,420
There we go. First we Check if

85

00:04:38,420  -->  00:04:47,870
battle is over, so let's add a comment

86

00:04:47,870  -->  00:04:57,680
here, Check if player won. Here Check if

87

00:04:57,680  -->  00:05:08,000
enemy won. I'm going to label that as enemy

88

00:05:08,000  -->  00:05:11,630
attacks phase.

89

00:05:11,630  -->  00:05:24,260
So, let's just comment right here Chose attack,

90

00:05:24,260  -->  00:05:29,030
elif enemy.choice == 1: we now need

91

00:05:29,030  -->  00:05:31,640
to generate a random number from

92

00:05:31,640  -->  00:05:37,340
the enemy's length of magic. So, let's go

93

00:05:37,340  -->  00:05:44,030
ahead and let's set magic_choice ==

94

00:05:44,030  -->  00:05:49,700
random.randrange, and it's going

95

00:05:49,700  -->  00:05:55,700
to be between 0 and enemy.magic, and

96

00:05:55,700  -->  00:05:58,130
it's going to be the length so we need to

97

00:05:58,130  -->  00:06:03,080
wrap that in the length method here. So it's

98

00:06:03,080  -->  00:06:04,190
going to generate a random number

99

00:06:04,190  -->  00:06:07,070
between 0 and the length of their magic

100

00:06:07,070  -->  00:06:09,050
list, so let's say they have five spells it's

101

00:06:09,050  -->  00:06:11,270
going to generate a number between 0 and

102

00:06:11,270  -->  00:06:13,130
5, so that's going to be the magic spell

103

00:06:13,130  -->  00:06:15,530
itself. So, what we're going to do is

104

00:06:15,530  -->  00:06:17,840
we're going to come up here and copy the

105

00:06:17,840  -->  00:06:23,930
magic, and we're going to say that's

106

00:06:23,930  -->  00:06:29,180
going to be spell and this is, well let's just

107

00:06:29,180  -->  00:06:32,840
type this out on our own. So we need to

108

00:06:32,840  -->  00:06:35,480
generate the damage and get their MP. So,

109

00:06:35,480  -->  00:06:41,300
magic_dmg is going to be equal to

110

00:06:41,300  -->  00:06:55,620
enemy.generate, actually magic.

111

00:06:55,620  -->  00:07:04,530
I believe we have that in the magic itself

112

00:07:04,530  -->  00:07:06,120
let me just check up here what we did

113

00:07:06,120  -->  00:07:13,569
with the player here.

114

00:07:13,569  -->  00:07:16,479
Yeah, alright, so that's what we did. We

115

00:07:16,479  -->  00:07:20,919
basically said spell equals their

116

00:07:20,919  -->  00:07:23,649
actual individual spell, and then spell

117

00:07:23,649  -->  00:07:27,939
generates damage. So, we're doing that

118

00:07:27,939  -->  00:07:30,309
in the same way just in one line, and then we need

119

00:07:30,309  -->  00:07:36,550
to get their magic points. So, if enemy.mp

120

00:07:36,550  -->  00:07:43,629
is less than...alright, that's why

121

00:07:43,629  -->  00:07:50,289
we did that. So, because we're using spell

122

00:07:50,289  -->  00:07:55,360
multiple times here so mp_cost,

123

00:07:55,360  -->  00:07:56,499
well actually let's just name that

124

00:07:56,499  -->  00:08:00,520
spell. Spell = enemy.magic

125

00:08:00,520  -->  00:08:06,819
[magic_choice]. So, spell.cost we are going

126

00:08:06,819  -->  00:08:09,999
to basically re-run it...

127

00:08:09,999  -->  00:08:25,430
let me think about this for a moment.

128

00:08:25,430  -->  00:08:27,320
We could break that out to its own

129

00:08:27,320  -->  00:08:38,570
function, or make this recursive which

130

00:08:38,570  -->  00:08:40,130
would require putting it in its own

131

00:08:40,130  -->  00:08:44,690
function. So, what we're going to do here

132

00:08:44,690  -->  00:08:49,790
let's go ahead and we need to pass in

133

00:08:49,790  -->  00:08:54,770
the enemy. So, let's copy this up here at

134

00:08:54,770  -->  00:09:00,950
the top left, can we put that into into its

135

00:09:00,950  -->  00:09:01,490
own

136

00:09:01,490  -->  00:09:07,100
person class? Let me check. Yeah, we

137

00:09:07,100  -->  00:09:12,410
can. Alright, so, let's drop this down,

138

00:09:12,410  -->  00:09:26,960
choose enemy spell. So enemy is going to

139

00:09:26,960  -->  00:09:40,899
turn into self.

140

00:09:40,899  -->  00:09:50,589
Yep, this should work.

141

00:09:50,589  -->  00:10:03,279
Alright, else return: the spell

142

00:10:03,279  -->  00:10:09,850
itself, or the magic damage, let's return the

143

00:10:09,850  -->  00:10:12,429
spell. That should work.

144

00:10:12,429  -->  00:10:17,619
Actually, let's return spell and magic

145

00:10:17,619  -->  00:10:18,550
damage.

146

00:10:18,550  -->  00:10:29,619
Alright, so, back up here and let's say

147

00:10:29,619  -->  00:10:38,230
enemy.choose_enemy_spell. Let's print

148

00:10:38,230  -->  00:10:46,920
out

149

00:10:46,920  -->  00:10:50,700
just make sure we've got these correct here.

150

00:10:50,700  -->  00:10:52,560
We're going to have to play this a bit

151

00:10:52,560  -->  00:10:53,940
to make sure,

152

00:10:53,940  -->  00:11:01,829
well to actually to get...alright, so empty

153

00:11:01,829  -->  00:11:04,949
range for randrange, okay. So, we screwed up

154

00:11:04,949  -->  00:11:06,510
there, let me just check.

155

00:11:06,510  -->  00:11:30,290
Self.magic...

156

00:11:30,290  -->  00:11:33,139
alright because we haven't passed any

157

00:11:33,139  -->  00:11:37,130
magic to the enemies. So, let's go

158

00:11:37,130  -->  00:11:40,130
ahead and give them a few spells as well.

159

00:11:40,130  -->  00:11:47,029
The magic is going to be lets say enemy

160

00:11:47,029  -->  00:12:03,709
spells equals fire, meteor, cure.

161

00:12:03,709  -->  00:12:09,139
Copy this, and there we go. So it looks

162

00:12:09,139  -->  00:12:10,790
like the enemy did

163

00:12:10,790  -->  00:12:13,459
choose magic but something went terribly

164

00:12:13,459  -->  00:12:14,329
wrong.

165

00:12:14,329  -->  00:12:21,380
Let's just attack, and enemy chose spell,

166

00:12:21,380  -->  00:12:23,509
so they did choose the spell correctly

167

00:12:23,509  -->  00:12:25,279
which is awesome.

168

00:12:25,279  -->  00:12:27,050
now all we need to do is actually take

169

00:12:27,050  -->  00:12:29,540
that spell they chose, they had enough

170

00:12:29,540  -->  00:12:32,149
magic points to do it, we need to reduce

171

00:12:32,149  -->  00:12:37,010
their MP and we need to

172

00:12:37,010  -->  00:12:42,319
determined this bit right here.

173

00:12:42,319  -->  00:12:49,370
Alright, so, enemy.reduce_mp, and we're

174

00:12:49,370  -->  00:12:54,079
going to reduce it by spell cost, then

175

00:12:54,079  -->  00:12:56,540
we're going to print that right there. So

176

00:12:56,540  -->  00:12:59,750
if spell type equals white we're going

177

00:12:59,750  -->  00:13:11,160
to say enemy heal for magic damage. So,

178

00:13:11,160  -->  00:13:18,690
we're going to say it heals enemy.name

179

00:13:18,690  -->  00:13:23,610
for X damage, and we're going to also

180

00:13:23,610  -->  00:13:28,199
have to turn this into

181

00:13:28,199  -->  00:13:32,879
basically another if condition that if

182

00:13:32,879  -->  00:13:34,680
their hit points are less than 20%

183

00:13:34,680  -->  00:13:37,139
or so then choose a white magic

184

00:13:37,139  -->  00:13:39,180
spell, otherwise and then randomize it,

185

00:13:39,180  -->  00:13:41,610
otherwise you know just keep rolling

186

00:13:41,610  -->  00:13:53,009
until they choose a black magic spell. So, let's say

187

00:13:53,009  -->  00:13:54,959
their target, was their target already

188

00:13:54,959  -->  00:13:58,829
chosen? No, alright. So let's just stop that

189

00:13:58,829  -->  00:14:03,990
right there.

190

00:14:03,990  -->  00:14:11,220
So players[target] take damage,

191

00:14:11,220  -->  00:14:15,959
we pass it magic damage. So

192

00:14:15,959  -->  00:14:19,949
what we're going to do is print out enemy.name.

193

00:14:19,949  -->  00:14:26,759
replace, add spaces, and we're going to go

194

00:14:26,759  -->  00:14:35,490
so it's going to say Imps fire deals you know

195

00:14:35,490  -->  00:14:44,279
however much damage. So, players got target,

196

00:14:44,279  -->  00:14:54,959
get_hp, print players.target has died.

197

00:14:54,959  -->  00:15:00,569
Then we're going to remove that player

198

00:15:00,569  -->  00:15:05,050
just for now.

199

00:15:05,050  -->  00:15:09,100
So let's comment out this, and let's see

200

00:15:09,100  -->  00:15:23,720
this run.

201

00:15:23,720  -->  00:15:35,040
So Imp attacked,

202

00:15:35,040  -->  00:15:55,000
so it's still one player is attacking...

203

00:15:55,089  -->  00:16:00,480
that's odd.

204

00:16:00,480  -->  00:16:06,480
Let's see what happens now.

205

00:16:06,480  -->  00:16:09,400
Alright,

206

00:16:09,400  -->  00:16:22,000
so, this is on line 202, and the issue is

207

00:16:22,000  -->  00:16:27,460
list indices must be integers or slices, not person.

208

00:16:27,460  -->  00:16:39,910
Where is, what?

209

00:16:39,910  -->  00:16:50,710
Oh, I didn't even see that bit right there.

210

00:16:50,710  -->  00:16:54,490
Alright, let's go ahead and try again.

211

00:16:54,490  -->  00:17:09,430
So, Imp heals, cure heals Imp for 634.

212

00:17:09,430  -->  00:17:12,580
That's strange because

213

00:17:12,580  -->  00:17:19,240
Magus is not attacking. There Magus

214

00:17:19,240  -->  00:17:27,290
attacks.

215

00:17:27,290  -->  00:17:29,660
So it's actually working, for the most

216

00:17:29,660  -->  00:17:38,450
part, except Imp keeps healing. Oh, yeah, this is

217

00:17:38,450  -->  00:17:40,910
definitely going to make it a lot more

218

00:17:40,910  -->  00:17:47,600
difficult.

219

00:17:47,600  -->  00:17:52,010
Nobody attacked that time. You know what,

220

00:17:52,010  -->  00:17:54,800
so here's the problem. We're

221

00:17:54,800  -->  00:17:58,910
generating the wrong numbers, so enemy

222

00:17:58,910  -->  00:18:00,950
choice there because we don't have three

223

00:18:00,950  -->  00:18:02,360
right now, we don't have item, we just

224

00:18:02,360  -->  00:18:04,040
have one or two that's why some of them

225

00:18:04,040  -->  00:18:09,800
weren't attacking. So there we go, so we've

226

00:18:09,800  -->  00:18:16,400
got three people attacking correctly, and

227

00:18:16,400  -->  00:18:20,840
alright, good stuff. So Imp attacks,

228

00:18:20,840  -->  00:18:23,330
Magus's meteor deals damage, so this is

229

00:18:23,330  -->  00:18:24,680
looking a lot better. Now what we need to

230

00:18:24,680  -->  00:18:25,970
do is just make sure they're not using

231

00:18:25,970  -->  00:18:28,070
white magic unless their hit points are

232

00:18:28,070  -->  00:18:30,530
less than 50%. So, what we're

233

00:18:30,530  -->  00:18:39,890
going to do is if spell.type ==

234

00:18:39,890  -->  00:18:59,960
"white": hold on that's in the, okay hold on.

235

00:18:59,960  -->  00:19:15,320
spell.type == "white" and self.hp, well

236

00:19:15,320  -->  00:19:26,540
it's going to be equal to let's say self.hp

237

00:19:26,540  -->  00:19:36,710
dived by self.maxhp * 100. So, and

238

00:19:36,710  -->  00:19:41,389
percent of their hit points

239

00:19:41,389  -->  00:19:48,229
is over 50, then they're going to choose a

240

00:19:48,229  -->  00:19:55,129
spell again. So if they don't have

241

00:19:55,129  -->  00:19:57,709
enough MP or if it's white magic and

242

00:19:57,709  -->  00:19:58,759
they have more than fifty percent

243

00:19:58,759  -->  00:20:00,289
health they're going to choose again, and

244

00:20:00,289  -->  00:20:01,999
they are going to choose black magic

245

00:20:01,999  -->  00:20:03,229
So let's go ahead and save this and make sure

246

00:20:03,229  -->  00:20:04,940
it works, we should see enemies not

247

00:20:04,940  -->  00:20:09,619
healing unless they are under fifty

248

00:20:09,619  -->  00:20:12,799
percent health. So, let's go ahead and

249

00:20:12,799  -->  00:20:14,299
start this and we're again just going to

250

00:20:14,299  -->  00:20:15,950
attack just for the sake of it.

251

00:20:15,950  -->  00:20:19,700
Alright, so, we see that Imp is really

252

00:20:19,700  -->  00:20:25,039
low, we have a bit of a issue there. So,

253

00:20:25,039  -->  00:20:27,679
when the enemy's attack we need to skip

254

00:20:27,679  -->  00:20:35,809
one more line, so there is definitely an

255

00:20:35,809  -->  00:20:41,179
for enemy in enemies right here. So we'll go print("\n"), and

256

00:20:41,179  -->  00:20:45,799
then above magic we need to remove

257

00:20:45,799  -->  00:20:47,539
that one right there.

258

00:20:47,539  -->  00:20:56,929
There we go. Alright, so, that's fine for

259

00:20:56,929  -->  00:20:59,570
now. We should we're going to play a

260

00:20:59,570  -->  00:21:01,309
little bit and see if we can see a heal,

261

00:21:01,309  -->  00:21:09,889
actually we're not going to get to that

262

00:21:09,889  -->  00:21:18,080
point because we are going to lose.

263

00:21:18,080  -->  00:21:20,779
Alright, so now we need to do a bit of

264

00:21:20,779  -->  00:21:22,669
healing, let's just use one of our mega

265

00:21:22,669  -->  00:21:37,429
elixirs. Alright, so, Magus attacks

266

00:21:37,429  -->  00:21:40,309
Valos, there we go. We're still good,

267

00:21:40,309  -->  00:21:50,210
let's go ahead and attack, and we might

268

00:21:50,210  -->  00:22:00,620
see a heal here soon. Let's give it another

269

00:22:00,620  -->  00:22:02,299
go and see what happens.

270

00:22:02,299  -->  00:22:06,590
Cure, oh his cure is so bad! Especially

271

00:22:06,590  -->  00:22:10,490
for his, let's give him a different

272

00:22:10,490  -->  00:22:13,429
cure spell. So let's go ahead and make curaga

273

00:22:13,429  -->  00:22:21,320
which again is from Final Fantasy, and

274

00:22:21,320  -->  00:22:22,970
it's going to cost

275

00:22:22,970  -->  00:22:31,100
50, it's going to cure for a 6000, it's going

276

00:22:31,100  -->  00:22:32,720
to be white, and this is going to be the only

277

00:22:32,720  -->  00:22:38,149
white magic that enemies have. So, if he

278

00:22:38,149  -->  00:22:39,649
does heal it's going to do a lot of

279

00:22:39,649  -->  00:22:41,779
healing, it's going to heal 6000, so that should make it more

280

00:22:41,779  -->  00:22:43,580
difficult. So I think we're good, we're

281

00:22:43,580  -->  00:22:44,690
not going to go through the items. The

282

00:22:44,690  -->  00:22:46,309
items would be the same thing for an

283

00:22:46,309  -->  00:22:49,490
enemy but in games enemies don't

284

00:22:49,490  -->  00:22:51,649
typically use items, so we don't even

285

00:22:51,649  -->  00:22:52,850
need to worry about that.

286

00:22:52,850  -->  00:22:55,279
So, I think we're done with this. This was

287

00:22:55,279  -->  00:22:57,500
a lot of fun actually I really enjoyed

288

00:22:57,500  -->  00:22:59,659
this. This code base is going to be

289

00:22:59,659  -->  00:23:03,350
updated on the github repository, so go

290

00:23:03,350  -->  00:23:05,750
ahead and go over to, and I'll put the

291

00:23:05,750  -->  00:23:10,970
link up there, it is github.com/

292

00:23:10,970  -->  00:23:15,110
nickgermaine. So, I will put this link in the

293

00:23:15,110  -->  00:23:17,630
video's discussion section you guys can

294

00:23:17,630  -->  00:23:19,460
go check it out, if I haven't already

295

00:23:19,460  -->  00:23:20,929
I'm not sure if I have i'll have to check. There are other

296

00:23:20,929  -->  00:23:22,490
repositories in my list of repositories.

297

00:23:22,490  -->  00:23:24,649
There's also other repositories there

298

00:23:24,649  -->  00:23:26,720
some of them also which relate to

299

00:23:26,720  -->  00:23:29,330
this course as well. So,

300

00:23:29,330  -->  00:23:31,190
thank you guys so much for watching this

301

00:23:31,190  -->  00:23:34,850
section of the course. Personally I would

302

00:23:34,850  -->  00:23:36,710
love to spend like so much more time on

303

00:23:36,710  -->  00:23:37,940
this but I just don't think we have the

304

00:23:37,940  -->  00:23:40,040
time, and we're going to be moving on to

305

00:23:40,040  -->  00:23:41,930
other more awesome things as well. And at

306

00:23:41,930  -->  00:23:43,880
some point we are going to be covering

307

00:23:43,880  -->  00:23:46,250
a video game creation library for

308

00:23:46,250  -->  00:23:49,220
Python. What I'd really like to do, if we

309

00:23:49,220  -->  00:23:51,770
have enough time to do it, would be to

310

00:23:51,770  -->  00:23:55,760
put a graphical front end to the logic

311

00:23:55,760  -->  00:23:58,370
in this game. I think that would be super

312

00:23:58,370  -->  00:23:59,900
awesome and we already have a lot of

313

00:23:59,900  -->  00:24:01,580
this created, so we would just need a

314

00:24:01,580  -->  00:24:05,150
plug it in to the PyGame which we would

315

00:24:05,150  -->  00:24:08,090
be using. So, i'll see you guys

316

00:24:08,090  -->  00:24:13,990
in the next video.
