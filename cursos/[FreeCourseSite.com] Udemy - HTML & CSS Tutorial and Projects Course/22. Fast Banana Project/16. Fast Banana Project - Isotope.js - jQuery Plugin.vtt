WEBVTT

00:00.140 --> 00:03.350
And the next section we're going to be building.

00:03.570 --> 00:05.850
Going to be or hiddenness future projects right.

00:05.850 --> 00:11.520
So basically what we're going to have is a bunch of images that we're hearing and we're going to be

00:11.520 --> 00:16.150
using one of Jay Querrey plug ins isotope in this case right here.

00:16.180 --> 00:19.790
And we can click right and it actually filters for us.

00:19.810 --> 00:20.180
Right.

00:20.340 --> 00:25.080
And it's also what's happening is let's say for the smaller screens right you can see that it's responsive

00:25.710 --> 00:28.220
and you can see how it's actually changing the images around.

00:28.220 --> 00:28.770
Right.

00:28.830 --> 00:31.110
So here we have let's say three right.

00:31.110 --> 00:34.540
And if we keep going to the bigger one you can see how it changes around.

00:34.660 --> 00:35.060
All right.

00:35.190 --> 00:37.780
But again this is a really nice feature right.

00:37.780 --> 00:40.050
And now it can if we want we can have them all.

00:40.350 --> 00:47.940
And before we actually place it in a project in my opinion it's always really smart to actually start

00:47.940 --> 00:49.730
working with an empty file.

00:49.730 --> 00:50.110
All right.

00:50.160 --> 00:53.030
So here you can see that if we go to Google right.

00:53.050 --> 00:55.340
This is going to be my isotope genius.

00:55.560 --> 01:00.420
But before we actually work in a project and just make a little bit more confusing than it has to be

01:00.850 --> 01:04.890
when I'm going to do or Hinnom is going to create a new file that we're going to right away pretty much

01:04.890 --> 01:05.380
delete.

01:05.400 --> 01:05.900
Right.

01:05.950 --> 01:11.400
I'm going to say this is going to be isotope right HVM now and we're going to create a file We're going

01:11.400 --> 01:15.900
to see how it works and then we can just be discarded and then we're actually going to work in our project

01:15.960 --> 01:19.010
right before we make everything confusing.

01:19.020 --> 01:25.440
This is going to be very straight up set up want to say full HDMI skeleton or here right and or here

01:25.530 --> 01:31.560
if we want to complete English and Watson and this is going to be set up like this.

01:31.560 --> 01:32.130
Right.

01:32.160 --> 01:36.080
Once we say this let's head back over here to the actual Goul.

01:36.130 --> 01:40.800
Right and if you're going to right over here I said yes this is what you're going to get.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.300
So I'm going to bravely open this one up.

01:43.440 --> 01:43.780
Right.

01:43.830 --> 01:50.750
And first of all you can see or hear that everything's explained right now just on set up alone.

01:50.760 --> 01:53.680
I think I can make a tutorial for five hours right.

01:53.790 --> 01:55.450
So we're not going to be doing that right.

01:55.470 --> 02:01.720
We will pretty much briefly look of what things we need to actually include in the argument.

02:01.840 --> 02:07.720
And if you want you can go ahead and actually explore for yourself in further detail.

02:07.720 --> 02:12.450
So here first things first install and then you can see again the same the Jake.

02:12.540 --> 02:13.840
We need CDN.

02:13.920 --> 02:18.670
Now we also need the actual Jacquard CD and also what I'm going to say here.

02:18.850 --> 02:19.250
All right.

02:19.260 --> 02:24.390
We're going to have a copy of it so you can see that this is going to be modified version or you can

02:24.390 --> 02:26.710
just have a regular doesn't really matter.

02:26.850 --> 02:31.980
Obviously you're for your production you want actually a magnified right.

02:32.040 --> 02:36.740
But also remember for commercial purposes right you actually do need to buy it right.

02:36.750 --> 02:39.900
Obviously we're going to be just testing it out so it doesn't matter.

02:40.110 --> 02:46.560
But do not make a website and start making money from it and just put it without paying for it.

02:46.770 --> 02:50.750
So I'm going to head back to document and note here first things first of all I'm going to say that

02:50.760 --> 02:52.810
this is going to be souped up.

02:52.980 --> 02:58.080
I so hope we're here and we're going to copy and paste this in this.

02:58.100 --> 03:02.660
So now we're here we have our I said then after that we'll do what we want.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.900
I would actually one day query magic.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.170
We already have.

03:06.410 --> 03:12.730
I mean remember we had the script for January so we're going to do the same thing or copy and paste.

03:12.750 --> 03:18.340
I took page IMAO And here we're going to have a query like this.

03:18.340 --> 03:20.330
So now we copied the Jaguar.

03:20.370 --> 03:24.570
So first things first how we can actually do the filtering.

03:24.870 --> 03:31.470
And it's actually very easy to go into filtering and you can see there's an explanation right.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.010
First of all we need grid.

03:33.160 --> 03:36.320
And basically this is going to be the variable we set up right.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.020
And here it's selectors.

03:38.130 --> 03:41.210
So we're going to start basically by getting whatever they're saying.

03:41.210 --> 03:41.800
All right.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.160
So I'm saying we're here.

03:43.160 --> 03:46.110
So this would be a selectors All right.

03:46.170 --> 03:48.540
And this is how we would do this right.

03:48.540 --> 03:52.990
So we'd select grid then it's going to be I said dope and then we'll do the filtering.

03:53.190 --> 03:53.550
Right.

03:53.700 --> 04:00.000
And this assumes that we're using and Jake way now if we go over here all the way in the bottom and

04:00.000 --> 04:02.340
we're going to find you here.

04:02.390 --> 04:03.220
Right.

04:03.240 --> 04:09.420
So it shows us how we can work with the buttons and how we can actually use the buttons.

04:09.420 --> 04:15.090
So what I'm going to do here since we are going to be replicating this in our project I'm actually going

04:15.090 --> 04:16.140
to do it this way.

04:16.300 --> 04:21.220
So I'm glad to hear comping and we're going to get it in our document.

04:21.290 --> 04:24.540
This is going to place right away the buttons.

04:24.540 --> 04:25.090
Right.

04:25.230 --> 04:28.470
And what we're going to do or here let's maybe delete some of them right.

04:28.470 --> 04:30.190
We don't need that many.

04:30.240 --> 04:33.840
I'd say we're all going to have a three of them right.

04:33.930 --> 04:40.440
And what we need to pay attention to is that button and then we need to hear and this Data Filter right

04:40.660 --> 04:43.170
again when we're going to be creating ourselves right.

04:43.170 --> 04:45.290
We're going to create everything from scratch right.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.860
We just pay attention to these glasses.

04:47.910 --> 04:50.380
I'm just going to name this class first.

04:50.910 --> 04:53.150
Let's say I'm going name this class.

04:53.580 --> 04:56.280
Second here and first over here.

04:56.510 --> 05:02.720
So first and this guys going to be second now we have these two classes here.

05:02.790 --> 05:07.730
Now we need actual content into what would be actually our content.

05:07.830 --> 05:12.230
And again when we were going to do is we can just go back to documentation.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.770
This is always going to be our best guess.

05:14.770 --> 05:21.320
Right so what we would want to know here we would need to look at what would be their actual sir.

05:21.390 --> 05:27.260
I know there are actually this kind of set up right where we have the grid right.

05:27.300 --> 05:32.200
And over here this is going to be here element and this is going to be the glasses.

05:32.390 --> 05:35.250
And you can see the classes are actually connected.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.010
Let me show you what I mean by this.

05:37.110 --> 05:41.680
So I'm going to add over here this grid and I'm going to do the copy.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.030
And again this was the buttons right.

05:44.190 --> 05:45.660
Now this is going to be the grid.

05:45.860 --> 05:46.120
Right.

05:46.110 --> 05:48.290
And those are going to be two separate things right.

05:48.450 --> 05:50.950
So now I can see that I have a grid.

05:51.300 --> 05:51.570
Right.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.890
And the buttons.

05:52.890 --> 05:58.800
Now what I'm going to do here is I'm going to delete the glasses that they are offering great and on

05:58.830 --> 06:03.610
here I'm going to write first and let's say we're here and this is going to be the second.

06:03.610 --> 06:04.960
All right here.

06:04.980 --> 06:07.980
This is going to be the second second here.

06:08.040 --> 06:11.710
And actually what I'm going to do I'm going to delete these ones for now.

06:11.710 --> 06:12.110
All right.

06:12.180 --> 06:13.480
Oh my goodness.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.440
And then just copy and paste this.

06:15.570 --> 06:19.230
And so I'm going to select both of them and let's say you know what.

06:19.290 --> 06:21.060
Let's let's actually add those images.

06:21.060 --> 06:21.480
All right.

06:21.720 --> 06:26.110
So first in this day of right you can see what I want.

06:26.310 --> 06:27.920
I want this to match.

06:28.050 --> 06:31.740
Actually this guy right here this button is going to be selecting them right.

06:31.740 --> 06:33.660
I obviously need these.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.750
Does that actually have this class right.

06:35.760 --> 06:42.510
It wouldn't make sense I'm having a data filter but I'm not actually using this as an image.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.030
Right.

06:43.110 --> 06:48.390
And again since we have the images right we can just grab it over here and let's do I don't know like

06:48.390 --> 06:49.670
some kind of.

06:50.310 --> 06:54.150
Well we can use the same ones maybe the ones that are going to be using later on.

06:54.150 --> 06:54.570
All right.

06:54.660 --> 06:59.060
So we're going to have a serious one but let's do a with right away let's say like Condren.

06:59.070 --> 07:01.860
So it's not actually all over the place right.

07:01.920 --> 07:08.320
So we have our first image or right and we're going to do is we're going to do the same thing.

07:08.460 --> 07:08.960
All right.

07:09.030 --> 07:13.930
And we're just going to change the image so we can just select image on here.

07:14.070 --> 07:15.330
Let's copy this.

07:15.600 --> 07:20.640
Let's paste it over here and over here let's change maybe the value.

07:20.950 --> 07:21.330
Right.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.980
So this is going to be number two.

07:23.310 --> 07:29.710
So what's happening over here right now is that we have two elements and both of them have image.

07:30.030 --> 07:34.580
But you can see the difference for them is where we have a first.

07:34.580 --> 07:35.170
All right.

07:35.220 --> 07:36.230
And the second.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.810
And over here that's going to be the difference.

07:38.850 --> 07:44.830
What we actually would want right here what we need to do here we need to change this one.

07:44.880 --> 07:49.550
The second one here maybe let's delete this line.

07:49.620 --> 07:51.630
This looks like the home line.

07:51.840 --> 07:56.830
And let's actually you can see that I'm doing all kinds of things that I actually don't need to do.

07:57.090 --> 08:00.310
And here would be what I would want to do is delete this line.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.850
Now I have these two divs.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.370
Let's make them maybe a few more.

08:04.390 --> 08:05.070
Right.

08:05.390 --> 08:11.760
Here you can see like this right now we have three images like this and three images like this.

08:11.760 --> 08:16.440
And what I would want is once I press the first one right only the first ones that are going to be showing

08:16.440 --> 08:20.970
red because you can see that I'm targeting this glass and this is going to be the first class.

08:21.180 --> 08:25.350
Then over here this is going to be the first class somewhere or here right.

08:25.350 --> 08:32.160
Let's maybe do a beautify because otherwise it's kind of hard for me to say what I have actually done

08:32.640 --> 08:33.030
right.

08:33.050 --> 08:37.120
So it's open there's more here and or here.

08:37.140 --> 08:43.560
Let's do the beautifies right now you can see that first class second class first class second class

08:43.560 --> 08:45.350
first class second class.

08:45.380 --> 08:50.210
Now we're going to go back over here and let's actually look at what we need to do.

08:50.550 --> 08:59.420
So under you I right that pretty much right away if we're using the bottom group they give you a sample.

08:59.610 --> 09:02.260
So we really don't need to even overthink this why.

09:02.420 --> 09:07.940
So what I'm going to do here we're just going to copy and paste this like this.

09:08.020 --> 09:13.170
And now we would need to create a script that's going to do here.

09:13.410 --> 09:15.170
I'm going to say script.

09:15.160 --> 09:16.600
We're not going to use a source.

09:16.770 --> 09:19.740
I'm going to do the internal script.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.280
I was going to copy and paste this one out here right.

09:22.320 --> 09:27.260
So once we say this one more here you can see what's saying right.

09:27.270 --> 09:30.050
So first of all I would want to target a grid.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.710
Do we have a classic grid.

09:31.840 --> 09:32.990
Well yes we do.

09:33.020 --> 09:36.450
Now maybe let's do this let's add actual let.

09:36.540 --> 09:41.320
This is going to make a little bit more sense now in javascript we're using Latin at the bar.

09:41.340 --> 09:46.910
All right then what it's saying I set up right at the isotope function.

09:46.920 --> 09:51.450
Then here we're targeting the filter button group or here.

09:51.450 --> 09:54.350
What is the button group or here is this one.

09:54.530 --> 09:57.750
So we have a filter button group or here.

09:58.020 --> 09:59.050
And what's happening.

09:59.240 --> 10:02.490
I would want a bottom right on click.

10:02.490 --> 10:05.030
So once I clicked the bottom what should happen right.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.470
Again we're going to create a variable.

10:07.620 --> 10:14.450
And again we're going to collect and basically we're going to check what is the attribute date of filter.

10:14.550 --> 10:19.600
I mean on the button and whatever it is we're actually going to show it filter.

10:19.650 --> 10:21.410
And this is going to be the filter value.

10:21.630 --> 10:26.670
So if the attribute is going to be first class the first class is going to be showing if the filter

10:27.250 --> 10:28.140
is going to be second class.

10:28.140 --> 10:31.530
The second reason is going to be very straightforward.

10:31.530 --> 10:38.070
So here you say this and we're going to refresh it over here and you can see that everything is working.

10:38.070 --> 10:42.180
First of all we can see that everything is working just because of the fact that you can see that I

10:42.230 --> 10:45.120
said right away line them up like this right.

10:45.240 --> 10:49.540
So this is the way that you know device is actually doing its thing right.

10:49.590 --> 10:54.660
And then over here we have show all first and second and we already know that if we're going to place

10:54.660 --> 10:58.680
the first button you can see only the first ones are shown.

10:58.680 --> 11:02.980
So it goes and finds the classes on here first first first.

11:02.990 --> 11:03.460
Right.

11:03.510 --> 11:04.870
And then we have the second.

11:04.980 --> 11:08.200
Right now we're here for a second.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.280
Now we actually have the second one.

11:10.450 --> 11:11.760
Well that's right.

11:11.760 --> 11:17.550
And for one show all now all of them are sharp right because you can see or hear the data filters pretty

11:17.550 --> 11:19.030
much data filter off.

11:19.230 --> 11:28.170
And again if we're going to go back to a documentation right we can go ahead and we can spend here countless

11:28.170 --> 11:28.610
hours.

11:28.610 --> 11:29.160
Right.

11:29.470 --> 11:34.350
And I mean again you can literally make another tutorial out of this but we're not going to be doing

11:34.350 --> 11:38.660
this because our goal is actually creating here this website project right.

11:38.700 --> 11:45.030
We're just using the Jake word plugins in our advantage to make our page stand up right.

11:45.120 --> 11:50.550
And I was like when we were going to redo the whole section right in our work section there was going

11:50.550 --> 11:53.240
to be next one creating here.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.830
Remember this guy right.

11:54.930 --> 11:57.320
We're still going to be recreating a lot of things.

11:57.330 --> 12:02.020
So if you didn't catch everything right don't worry there's going to be still time right.

12:02.040 --> 12:09.060
However this gives as a basic example right we're using a button then we using the same filter button
