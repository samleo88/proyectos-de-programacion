00:00.310 --> 00:00.950
Awesome.

00:01.020 --> 00:05.240
We have covered inline internal and external CSX.

00:05.430 --> 00:11.970
However before we dive into the syntax and how we can create a syntax what are the rules for the syntax.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.780
I would like to show you which one is more powerful.

00:14.910 --> 00:19.060
So if you're looking at these three options it's gonna come important later on.

00:19.150 --> 00:24.030
It's gonna basically matter a lot of times which one of them is more powerful.

00:24.030 --> 00:26.150
Now let me show you what I mean by this.

00:26.190 --> 00:28.690
First of all I'd like to clean up all of workspace a little bit.

00:28.710 --> 00:33.510
I mean you don't have to do this but I'm gonna set it up basically the workspace how we all going to

00:33.510 --> 00:34.470
use this.

00:34.470 --> 00:35.220
So let me close.

00:35.220 --> 00:36.320
First of all the tabs.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.610
For now I would just like to have my next Schimmel.

00:39.060 --> 00:44.700
I'm going to use the style C assess and I'm going to move them out of the C S this folder as well as

00:44.700 --> 00:49.700
I'm going to delete the C as this folder so I'm not going to use it right now and I'm gonna get rid

00:49.710 --> 00:55.010
of the about the email as well so I'm gonna be left with only index CML.

00:55.230 --> 00:58.560
And here let's create the proper path.

00:58.560 --> 01:02.000
So we're gonna have the style C assess and now this is gonna be my setup.

01:02.700 --> 01:08.420
So as I'm looking at this right I have my head in one as well as having two and for now what.

01:08.430 --> 01:08.850
You know what.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.420
I can just deal with adding one because we're only gonna show you one example and then if I have my

01:15.420 --> 01:20.940
styles with let's say color blue What do you think happens if I'm gonna create another one.

01:20.940 --> 01:26.700
The internal C assess and again remember this was done by using the style sheets and let's say here

01:26.700 --> 01:28.720
I'm gonna write that you know what.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.600
Heading ones are gonna be different color.

01:31.650 --> 01:34.710
I think one is gonna be let's say red.

01:34.860 --> 01:40.650
So again let me write the proper syntax which we will cover learn in the next video and let's say a

01:40.650 --> 01:42.210
color is gonna be red.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.090
What do you think is going to happen.

01:44.260 --> 01:51.300
This year I'm having having one with color blue but in my internal style sheet I am writing this has

01:51.300 --> 01:52.050
color red.

01:52.110 --> 01:53.390
Now I haven't saved it yet.

01:53.700 --> 01:59.110
So nothing obviously is happening but what do you think is gonna happen once I say it using heading

01:59.190 --> 02:00.890
one is going to be blue or red.

02:01.130 --> 02:02.480
Now let's test it out.

02:02.610 --> 02:05.190
Let me save this an interesting.

02:05.190 --> 02:13.440
What's happening is my headings not blue but in fact they're red so I can see that the internal style

02:13.440 --> 02:18.780
sheet is stronger than the external one because we are overwriting this.

02:18.970 --> 02:22.800
Now let me tell you right away that we can use both of them.

02:22.800 --> 02:29.250
So let's say if you would have some kind of styles here for having one but you would have different

02:29.400 --> 02:31.080
styling here for having two.

02:31.170 --> 02:32.270
You can do that.

02:32.310 --> 02:35.740
It's not like against the law or anything like that.

02:35.760 --> 02:41.370
However just remember that if you're going to have some kind of style here already for having one you

02:41.370 --> 02:42.660
will going to override this.

02:43.200 --> 02:48.690
So if you're selecting the same element for the same class or I.D. or whatever if you're having the

02:48.690 --> 02:55.230
same selector and you already have this style property and value in your external success in the internal

02:55.230 --> 02:57.090
one you're going to override.

02:57.090 --> 03:03.020
Now see if I'm selecting the heading to and for having two I have no selections right now I have no

03:03.020 --> 03:06.630
see ISIS rules in the external one it's obviously not going to matter.

03:06.710 --> 03:10.610
So let's say font size is gonna be I don't know three arms then.

03:10.760 --> 03:16.760
This is just going to affect it because I don't have any styles there but if I would have some different

03:16.760 --> 03:21.440
stuff here it will gonna get overwritten and that's something important.

03:21.440 --> 03:24.260
Now we also have the inline six as I remember.

03:24.290 --> 03:29.900
So what about if we go to one of the heading ones and obviously this is gonna work the same on all of

03:29.900 --> 03:35.330
them but I'm not going to show you the way we do it in all of them because there's just a waste of time.

03:35.450 --> 03:42.230
So let's just look at the first one and heroes again change the color and let's use the green one.

03:42.260 --> 03:44.670
Now what do you think is going to happen right now.

03:44.900 --> 03:46.820
So let's save this and let's see.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.740
Mm hmm interesting.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.840
So we have the external one that had a color blue.

03:52.940 --> 03:57.080
Then we use the internal one and we basically said you know what.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.190
No it's gonna be red.

03:59.270 --> 04:04.910
And then last but not least we have the inline one which pretty much override both of them.

04:04.910 --> 04:07.040
And now we have the color green.

04:07.070 --> 04:11.760
So what you need to remember is that the inline one is gonna be the most strongest one.

04:11.780 --> 04:17.060
So whatever you're gonna write here within in line he is going to overwrite everything that you have

04:17.060 --> 04:19.390
with an internal or external.

04:19.490 --> 04:23.490
The same way with internal you will going to override the external one.

04:24.080 --> 04:29.720
And again this is gonna save you a lot of time when you're looking for some kind of bugs is to remember

04:29.720 --> 04:32.860
that in line one would be the most powerful one.

04:32.900 --> 04:37.100
Then we have the internal one and only then we have the external.
