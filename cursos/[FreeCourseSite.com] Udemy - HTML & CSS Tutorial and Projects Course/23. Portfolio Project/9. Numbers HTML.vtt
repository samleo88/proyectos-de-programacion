WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:04.040
The next section are going to be creating is going to be the numbers section.

00:04.050 --> 00:08.240
So we're really going to have a background the background image is going to be fixed.

00:08.300 --> 00:14.410
Then this is going to be the title here here again these are going to be fun Tarsem with some text.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.090
So let's go back to the index page.

00:17.100 --> 00:24.140
Now let's go to the bottom where is the end of services section and oh here again create a comment.

00:24.210 --> 00:27.990
So this will be an adverse section here.

00:27.990 --> 00:33.530
Copy paste this and on here like me they fix my typo here.

00:33.540 --> 00:35.090
This is going to be section.

00:35.100 --> 00:42.900
And once we have the actual numbers section comments non-sexually place or here this section element

00:43.640 --> 00:49.060
here maybe that's right and of numbers section here and now it's place the section.

00:49.310 --> 00:58.590
So here for the numbers let's start with a section with a class of numbers and let's say numbers numbers

00:58.920 --> 01:00.150
here press.

01:00.300 --> 01:02.050
And we have our numbers section.

01:02.170 --> 01:05.990
Now here is a section title the one that we created before.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.290
So what I'm going to say here I would want to find a section that will.

01:10.430 --> 01:13.220
Once I found the actual section title.

01:13.250 --> 01:19.030
I'm just going to go up over here and select along with the comments that I'm just going to copy and

01:19.040 --> 01:19.880
paste this.

01:19.970 --> 01:25.640
I'm going to go down where I finished actually working in the numbers section and just copy and paste.

01:25.660 --> 01:28.590
Now obviously all here what I would want to change is the value.

01:28.800 --> 01:32.510
So this is not going to be services this is going to be actually numbers.

01:32.640 --> 01:39.480
And once they scroll down in my page or here you can see that right now I have right away my title and

01:39.480 --> 01:45.900
this is how we're making use of the fact that we can create the title one time and then we don't need

01:45.900 --> 01:46.920
to actually repeat it.

01:46.920 --> 01:50.030
We can just change the value for that name.

01:50.230 --> 01:56.120
So once I have a title now we're going to have again the same thing as numbers center.

01:56.130 --> 02:01.090
So this is going to be again a wrapper for our actual phantasms and everything.

02:01.120 --> 02:04.380
So we're going to say numbers and center.

02:04.400 --> 02:04.650
All right.

02:04.650 --> 02:07.750
So this is going to be the day when we're going to use for centric.

02:07.830 --> 02:14.610
And after that again what I would want is only a single number so a single number here.

02:14.610 --> 02:18.830
Copy and paste and or here right write and of a single number.

02:18.830 --> 02:21.220
And what I would want or here in this single number.

02:21.420 --> 02:24.030
So first of all let's do an article.

02:24.030 --> 02:30.580
The article is actually going to have a class here and the class is going to be numbers that have 200

02:30.580 --> 02:31.430
scores.

02:31.500 --> 02:34.980
Single single number.

02:35.010 --> 02:37.380
So this is going to be a single element.

02:37.540 --> 02:42.370
Now once we have or here in this article then let's place a fantasy in my gut.

02:42.410 --> 02:46.330
And in this case we're not going to use a div we are actually going to use a span.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.430
So I'm going to say numbers 200 scores again.

02:49.470 --> 02:56.390
And this is going to be single number and number and we're going to call this icon here.

02:56.660 --> 02:58.090
So this is going to be the icon.

02:58.240 --> 03:05.450
No in this band and we're going to have a I element has a user's on here.

03:05.760 --> 03:12.150
Let's say it here let me get back my M and save it over here and sure enough out here you can see that

03:12.150 --> 03:20.340
if we have Arakan now after we have this brown ready the next one is actually going to be our number.

03:20.340 --> 03:22.680
So I'm going to say we're heading 1 again.

03:22.710 --> 03:29.500
The class numbers are here single and we're going to say number one here text.

03:29.530 --> 03:29.950
All right.

03:29.970 --> 03:31.760
So this is going to be.

03:31.980 --> 03:35.240
Once I press the time and then heading one we'll get it right.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.710
This is going to be hundred.

03:36.960 --> 03:40.950
And after that last one we're going to have here this is going to be next.

03:40.950 --> 03:49.410
So here we're going to say heading to with a glass of numbers and we're going to say single number title

03:49.720 --> 03:52.500
or this is going to be our title or he'll win.

03:52.500 --> 03:52.770
Right.

03:52.770 --> 03:56.740
And this is going to be happy clients here say it.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.110
Now again we know what we need to do.

03:59.110 --> 04:03.250
So we're going to check where is our single number we're going to copy and paste.

04:03.260 --> 04:04.430
What are you doing this.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.230
And you can see that I want one too much.

04:07.460 --> 04:07.730
All right.

04:07.780 --> 04:14.270
So me go back over here and let's say that I would want to copy to the end of where it is my title and

04:14.270 --> 04:19.460
let's just copy and paste this one two three or here and honestly again the same thing.

04:19.580 --> 04:22.330
No one is going to have to change the values.

04:22.410 --> 04:26.710
I'm going to go back and hop over here and you can see this was my start.

04:26.970 --> 04:30.030
So let's change this first this users.

04:30.300 --> 04:35.700
So I'm going to change this users and we're going to say here thumbs up.

04:35.700 --> 04:39.460
So this is going to be my first column that I'm changing.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.030
So once I say it check it out or here.

04:42.030 --> 04:43.710
Now we have our thumbs up.

04:43.710 --> 04:46.150
So here we're also going to have a different.

04:46.180 --> 04:52.230
Are you going to say that this is going to be 245 and this is going to be project.

04:52.220 --> 04:57.930
So here we're going to say this is going to be instead of happy playing it's going to call this a project.

04:57.960 --> 05:03.900
Now after that the next one is going to read the lines of code so I'm going to call this and I it.

05:03.930 --> 05:05.860
So are you going to say this is going to be.

05:05.870 --> 05:10.890
And I did it here and read it.

05:10.910 --> 05:15.420
What I would want is going to be lines of code so let's say we're like this.

05:15.590 --> 05:18.720
Maybe I don't know some some kind of volume like this.

05:18.890 --> 05:24.220
And we're going to call these lines of code here.

05:24.320 --> 05:29.080
And the last one is going to be trophy and trophies are going to be words of five.

05:29.390 --> 05:36.740
So here what we would need to use to change our here is users to a trophy here.

05:36.800 --> 05:42.290
So we sell it then we're going to have let's say five of them or six of them and here we're going to

05:42.290 --> 05:49.700
call these words and once we're done here with writing words ready to jump to see us and actually start

05:49.950 --> 05:51.380
styling our numbers section.
