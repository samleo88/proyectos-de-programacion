WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:04.280
Well let's go ahead and let's actually create comments here.

00:04.280 --> 00:08.000
All right so first of all well actually this is the wrong place.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.410
I mean do we this or here what we're going to say here you comment or here and then we're going to say

00:13.410 --> 00:14.770
this is going to be in the header.

00:14.770 --> 00:15.380
All right.

00:15.390 --> 00:19.920
So this is going to be the banner the first one was heard or now we're going to be working with the

00:19.920 --> 00:23.250
banner and the banner here is going to be this guy.

00:23.310 --> 00:27.110
And the first thing that we're going to say is we would want a back room.

00:27.150 --> 00:32.520
So I'm going to say we're here this is going to be hash tag banner and maybe let's again create a lot

00:32.520 --> 00:33.490
of room.

00:33.540 --> 00:36.710
So it is easy for us to work out here.

00:36.720 --> 00:42.590
I'm going to say curly braces and then I'm going to say background and I know you are going to write.

00:42.600 --> 00:48.270
You are all right here and then we're going to place the image right here you can see that I have a

00:48.480 --> 00:53.960
background image right now because here we have a background image but we're here.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.680
We need to fix things.

00:55.710 --> 01:02.460
So first of all we would want to fix is we would actually fix a background attachment and that's going

01:02.460 --> 01:07.500
to create this parallax effect right as we were actually scrolling up and down.

01:07.500 --> 01:13.020
You can see that the background is going to be moving slower than the text that's actually placed in

01:13.020 --> 01:13.930
the background.

01:14.170 --> 01:17.860
I don't have a background size background.

01:17.940 --> 01:24.890
And we're going to say size and that's going to be a cover on here because we would want not can ever

01:25.530 --> 01:27.740
cover more here.

01:27.740 --> 01:27.980
All right.

01:27.990 --> 01:34.180
So you would want to cover the whole thing then or here we would want a background repeat and we're

01:34.180 --> 01:41.350
going to say background repeat no repeat background repeat no repeat.

01:41.400 --> 01:48.060
Then after that we're going to have a background position back ground position and we're going to say

01:48.060 --> 01:51.170
Senator on this.

01:51.310 --> 01:56.500
We're going to place it in the center and then we're going to have all here we want to place this text

01:56.500 --> 01:57.490
in the center.

01:57.530 --> 02:01.230
So I'm going to say this play works here.

02:01.230 --> 02:07.480
So now the actual battery is going to be flex parent then all here we're going to have a line items

02:08.300 --> 02:15.910
and I'm going to say line items center here and just if I can to also Center to actually want to place

02:15.910 --> 02:22.390
them both in the center and you can see the beauty over here and the very very beginning right when

02:22.390 --> 02:26.010
we had over here this letter and this play flaks right.

02:26.050 --> 02:29.110
So this is going to be hundred review right now.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.690
Here we had it now and we had about it.

02:31.690 --> 02:39.070
So basically what I'm saying is this whole screen right here should be always 100 percent.

02:39.370 --> 02:43.730
And the Nav. We're here with a banner should actually split it.

02:43.800 --> 02:44.050
Right.

02:44.050 --> 02:48.870
However they would want and you can see or hear the key or here this is flex one.

02:49.090 --> 02:49.340
Right.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.070
Because you find get rid of this right.

02:51.070 --> 02:52.760
This is how it's going to look like.

02:52.780 --> 03:00.180
However if we go back to grow now the banner grows all the way right to fill up the screen because over

03:00.190 --> 03:03.430
here the height was 100 percent or 100 yards.

03:03.460 --> 03:03.900
All right.

03:03.910 --> 03:05.700
So this is how we come together.

03:06.070 --> 03:09.190
Now we have placed the text in the center now.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.770
Is just the easy part.

03:10.840 --> 03:14.460
We actually need to have a styling for this text.

03:14.590 --> 03:21.130
So here I'm going to say this is going to be banner and I'm going to say box here and this and then

03:21.130 --> 03:31.810
we're going to have over here a color here on this and we're going to say this 5 5 5 here and we're

03:31.810 --> 03:34.790
going to have the text align center.

03:35.100 --> 03:42.790
And this then we're going to have a banner Tyrel I'm going to say Vanner title like this and then we're

03:42.790 --> 03:44.530
going to say text.

03:44.720 --> 03:51.790
I'm going to say transform and we would want capitalize on line so we would want the title to actually

03:51.790 --> 03:53.140
be kept twice.

03:53.300 --> 04:01.180
Then after that we would want a font size font size over here and we're going to say 60 pixels like

04:01.210 --> 04:01.750
this.

04:01.780 --> 04:04.080
So 60 pixels is great.

04:04.090 --> 04:05.740
Again more room.

04:05.750 --> 04:12.820
All right then the next one after title is going to be barnburner on the line banner are you on the

04:12.830 --> 04:13.590
line.

04:13.930 --> 04:20.050
And then when we're going to say this is going to be with of I'd say 200 pixels.

04:20.490 --> 04:25.490
You know this is going to have a margin of 10 pixels over here.

04:25.620 --> 04:26.650
All right.

04:26.650 --> 04:31.720
And you can't see anything right because we haven't added the most important thing is going to be border

04:32.400 --> 04:38.680
where three pixels on here are solid and we're going to create a blue one here and we're going to say

04:38.680 --> 04:45.000
hash tag to be here 9 8 0.

04:45.060 --> 04:45.930
All right.

04:46.170 --> 04:48.480
So now we have the blue line.

04:48.580 --> 04:52.270
Then after that we're going to have a banner subtitle.

04:52.270 --> 04:56.780
So we're going to say we're here banner on your sub title.

04:56.870 --> 05:00.250
So that's going to be text underneath the slim margin.

05:00.310 --> 05:01.900
Twenty pixels.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.840
And this is going to be zero pixels.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.470
So on the sides we're going to zero pixels on top bottom and have some margins.

05:08.470 --> 05:10.580
This is going to be 40 pixels down.

05:10.840 --> 05:19.930
And after that it's going to be zero again text or here transform is going to be a capitalize on this

05:20.460 --> 05:26.450
and then we're going to have a font size 25 pixels we're 25 pixels.

05:26.530 --> 05:29.750
Then after that we would want to use to work with them.

05:30.160 --> 05:34.030
But before we work with the link you can see or hear there's one issue right.

05:34.090 --> 05:38.130
You can see it over here my picture right is very bright.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.710
And how do we do that.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.080
How do we get rid of this right.

05:41.080 --> 05:43.650
Because the text is white in the pictures right.

05:43.710 --> 05:47.540
We can go back over here and we can place a linear gradient.

05:47.620 --> 05:52.810
So we're going to sell in here gradient here and then we're going to get in place.

05:52.810 --> 06:02.380
RG beat be 0 0 0 here and then we're going to say we're here I don't know I'd say something along the

06:02.380 --> 06:05.420
5 or 3 or something like that right.

06:05.470 --> 06:08.470
So this is going to be basically how transparent it is.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.630
So I'm going to say we're three closer.

06:10.630 --> 06:20.320
Come on NRG be zero zero zero zero point three and then we're going to place a camera here.

06:20.330 --> 06:20.900
All right.

06:21.070 --> 06:27.230
So now we can see that we placed the overlay in front of the image here right.

06:27.310 --> 06:31.010
And you can see that with this one right we first selected the color.

06:31.130 --> 06:33.410
Right so you can select whatever color you want.

06:33.410 --> 06:35.770
I just picked the black one with all the zeros.

06:36.070 --> 06:37.810
Here you can see how transparent.

06:37.870 --> 06:38.430
Right.

06:38.470 --> 06:42.370
So obviously one would mean that it's totally all hair black.

06:42.370 --> 06:46.520
You can see on the top right and 0.3 is over here right.

06:46.540 --> 06:52.340
But I'm going to keep both of them 0.3 right so it's not too much or not too well now that we are done

06:52.340 --> 06:56.720
with this let's go back and let's just style the link here.

06:56.840 --> 07:06.560
What I'm going to say is this is going to be a id banner here box and this a.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.260
And then I'm going to say display.

07:10.310 --> 07:12.650
Inline block here.

07:12.890 --> 07:17.360
Then I'm going to say padding and padding is going to be 10 pixels here.

07:17.420 --> 07:21.770
And the reason why we're doing inline blocks are actually when we're adding the padding.

07:21.770 --> 07:27.320
It actually means something otherwise if you're just if you're not going to have inline block or block

07:27.730 --> 07:33.170
and pretty much padding it's still not going to affect you and it's still going to be bumping into the

07:33.170 --> 07:34.580
different elements.

07:34.580 --> 07:40.070
So basically if we know that we're here and this link will be in line element right now we're actually

07:40.070 --> 07:46.030
making it a block element but we don't want it to be spanning all across that we're making inline block.

07:46.160 --> 07:54.140
Then after that we would want a font size and we're going to set font size is going to be 40 pixels.

07:54.890 --> 08:03.490
Then that we're going to be text decoration in here then we're going to have a color.

08:03.680 --> 08:06.180
F5 F5 F5.

08:06.430 --> 08:13.880
You know there's going to have a background and the background is going to be hash tag to be on here

08:14.390 --> 08:20.950
9 8 0 and you can see this and this was supposed to be hash tag right.

08:21.150 --> 08:26.660
Now this is going to be a blue background then we're going to have a border here and we're going to

08:26.660 --> 08:29.640
say three pixels solid here.

08:29.690 --> 08:31.640
And again we're going to use the same car.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.910
And the reason why we're adding all these more is because once we're going to be actually adding a hovering

08:37.910 --> 08:38.840
effect right.

08:38.990 --> 08:43.550
If we don't do this then your actual whole screen is going to be changing and I'm going to show you

08:43.550 --> 08:44.700
this again.

08:44.710 --> 08:45.010
Right.

08:45.010 --> 08:46.880
So we'll have a border.

08:46.920 --> 08:50.410
And again we're going to use this transition smooth transition.

08:50.560 --> 08:55.820
And again by now you should know that we're going to actually have to write a properties that we would

08:55.820 --> 08:57.930
want to listen in to the ground.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.490
Three seconds.

08:59.540 --> 09:07.280
He's going to have a border and the board is going to be 0.5 he's here like this.

09:07.450 --> 09:09.730
So now that we have them.

09:11.180 --> 09:17.210
So we're going to go back over here and what we're going to say and this is going to be a banner box

09:17.710 --> 09:22.970
and I'm going to say hey I'm here and I'm going to say hover.

09:23.030 --> 09:26.320
So once we have the Hummer we're going to say background.

09:26.690 --> 09:38.430
Transparent transparent like this and then to say border this is going to be three pixels solid here

09:38.580 --> 09:43.280
and we're going to have a hash tag and 5 5 5.

09:43.860 --> 09:46.600
Now let's say this and let's see what happens.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.990
Now I can see that it's actually changing right.

09:49.230 --> 09:51.650
But this is not happening the way we want.

09:51.660 --> 09:51.890
Right.

09:51.900 --> 09:56.160
Because this is pretty much changing as we're actually hovering right.

09:56.340 --> 10:02.180
But that's not what we wanted we would want a three seconds easy or here right.

10:02.490 --> 10:09.870
So let's go back over here and the mistake here is the fact that I missed the second answer or here

10:09.880 --> 10:14.290
if we say this I can see that it's actually doing this gradually right.

10:14.310 --> 10:16.040
So this was my mistake.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.780
That's why nothing was happening.

10:17.910 --> 10:23.820
And now we can go back over here and we can actually figure out why we had over this border.

10:23.860 --> 10:24.430
Right.

10:24.450 --> 10:30.050
So let's say if we would come in this one out and this and let's say this and let's see what happens

10:30.060 --> 10:32.850
right now I can see that the whole text is moving.

10:32.950 --> 10:33.430
Right.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.260
Because you can see that we're actually adding the border.

10:36.390 --> 10:41.550
Now if we wouldn't have done that right then obviously this would be the result.

10:41.580 --> 10:43.800
So therefore we had to do more.

10:43.980 --> 10:47.310
And then over here you can see that text is not changing right.

10:47.340 --> 10:49.850
Only the hovering effect is happening.

10:50.070 --> 10:54.910
And now we can go back or here right and we can see how it would look on the full screen.

10:54.930 --> 10:55.550
Right.

10:55.590 --> 10:59.870
So this is going to be our nav bar on here like this right.

10:59.880 --> 11:04.370
This is going to be our search on if we have a row here this is going to be defect.

11:04.370 --> 11:04.850
Right.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.410
And we just need to refresh it over here right.

11:07.470 --> 11:13.920
And now I can see that it's actually going to be doing this even though we actually save this so save

11:13.950 --> 11:15.780
it again fresh.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.320
And now I can see that everything is working right.

11:18.330 --> 11:26.250
However if we got the smaller screen or here like this than what we have is our number then we can actually

11:26.250 --> 11:32.670
use in this or here and everything is moving and or here you can see that this is going to be exactly

11:33.060 --> 11:40.060
hundred units and now we're ready to move onto the next section and start working with the skills section.
