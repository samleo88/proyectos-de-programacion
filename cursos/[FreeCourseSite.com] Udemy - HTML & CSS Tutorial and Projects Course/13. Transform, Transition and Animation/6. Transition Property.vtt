Husam once we have the general idea about the transform property we're going to shift our attention

00:06.540 --> 00:08.190
to transition.

00:08.190 --> 00:14.850
And if in one sentence I would need to answer you what is the transition that would be change happening

00:15.000 --> 00:16.710
over some period of time.

00:16.860 --> 00:20.160
And again the example is going to explain it much more better.

00:20.160 --> 00:25.860
But if I would have to give you a one sentence example that would be a change over time.

00:25.890 --> 00:31.500
Now you'll notice also that transition property is going to be a lot similar like we had with background

00:31.980 --> 00:37.770
because this is gonna have quite a few of them and eventually we're going to look at a shorthand and

00:37.770 --> 00:43.440
the setup is gonna be exactly the same we're going to have three ideas and let's figure out one problem

00:44.060 --> 00:52.350
let's say that I have three divs we already know how to use the hover pseudo selector and as I'm hovering

00:52.350 --> 00:55.190
over those divs I would like to change the color.

00:55.470 --> 00:57.210
So for now I have red green and blue.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.690
But let's say for all the divs as I'm hovering.

00:59.730 --> 01:04.630
And again we would need to use the pseudo selector we would like to change the background color and

01:04.740 --> 01:10.280
let's say background color is gonna be whatever you'd like to be in my case I'm gonna go with core.

01:10.740 --> 01:13.560
So far so good as I'm hovering over it there.

01:13.590 --> 01:15.510
The color is changing how are you.

01:15.510 --> 01:19.650
Probably say noticing that the color is changing instantly.

01:19.650 --> 01:26.550
And while that might work in some cases you probably would want to happen is change over some period

01:26.550 --> 01:29.220
of time because I think it's going to look smoother.

01:29.430 --> 01:30.340
Now how do we do.

01:30.640 --> 01:31.890
Well first of all let's just work.

01:31.890 --> 01:36.690
We had number three because I would still want you to see the other two where change is going to happen

01:36.700 --> 01:42.810
instead and let's say for number three first we would need to start working with transition now for

01:42.810 --> 01:48.300
transition with first would need to say what kind of property wow is this going to be I don't know the

01:48.300 --> 01:51.710
font size is this going to be had on with or whatever.

01:51.720 --> 01:56.110
Well in my case I'm gonna say that transition property is going to be the background so I'm going to

01:56.110 --> 01:57.250
write background.

01:57.570 --> 01:58.970
So far so good.

01:59.120 --> 01:59.820
Okay.

02:00.030 --> 02:01.710
Once we save it what happens.

02:01.710 --> 02:02.610
Well nothing happens.

02:02.610 --> 02:08.490
We're still having this change instantly because the second thing we will need to add is transition

02:08.640 --> 02:11.010
and then we're going to be looking for duration.

02:11.520 --> 02:15.270
So how long this transition is gonna take place.

02:15.270 --> 02:18.050
We can use these seconds we can use milliseconds.

02:18.060 --> 02:21.340
Normally we're going to settle for something like zero point three.

02:21.570 --> 02:26.220
But just because I would want you to see how this is happening I'm gonna go with quite a big number

02:26.230 --> 02:27.940
and this is gonna be for 6.

02:28.260 --> 02:31.290
So as I'm hovering over what happened.

02:31.350 --> 02:33.170
Well the color is changing.

02:33.210 --> 02:37.300
However the color is changing over a period of four seconds.

02:37.410 --> 02:39.080
Not instantly like with the rest.

02:39.690 --> 02:42.480
And this is something that we can do we transition property.
