Congrats guys on finishing the project.

00:02.880 --> 00:05.090
Hopefully that everything worked out.

00:05.100 --> 00:12.120
However if you got stuck on something please remember that for every video there is also there in the

00:12.120 --> 00:18.660
resources the folder that contains the code from that specific video as well as in the resources of

00:18.660 --> 00:20.600
this video that you're watching right now.

00:20.760 --> 00:26.760
You can get the final project code so you can just download it and compare it if you have any kind of

00:26.760 --> 00:27.270
mistakes.
