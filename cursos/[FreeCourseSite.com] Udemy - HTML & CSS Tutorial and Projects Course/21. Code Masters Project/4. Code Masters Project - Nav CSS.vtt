WEBVTT

00:00.020 --> 00:02.420
Well let's go to Mayne's he says.

00:02.670 --> 00:06.340
For now we only have a four of five for the body.

00:06.390 --> 00:06.630
Right.

00:06.630 --> 00:09.900
So this is going to be the role for Marri But what are we going to do right.

00:09.900 --> 00:13.680
Well we're going to get rid of these default margins and paddings.

00:13.890 --> 00:22.390
So we're going to say select all we're going to say margin zero and paddings zero or here like this.

00:22.500 --> 00:28.950
And once we have these two zeros and also we're going to have a box sizing here and we're going to say

00:28.960 --> 00:29.880
more books.

00:29.960 --> 00:36.330
And basically what I mean what do we mean by that is that once you actually set some kind of value to

00:36.330 --> 00:40.740
any kind of element right if we're going to be changing anything with margins and paddings the actual

00:40.740 --> 00:43.020
element is not going to get bigger.

00:43.410 --> 00:48.590
It's actually what's going to happen that this is going to affect the inside of an element.

00:48.610 --> 00:48.920
Right.

00:48.930 --> 00:53.420
This is not going to affect the outside it's not going to become bigger at the margins and paddings

00:53.450 --> 00:55.050
are going to work in work.

00:55.230 --> 00:55.800
So we're here.

00:55.800 --> 01:00.210
Well I'm sorry to paddings right now at the margins margins are actually going to work towards the outside

01:00.630 --> 01:03.470
but departing is not going to work towards the outside.

01:03.540 --> 01:06.100
So or here if we have a body.

01:06.270 --> 01:13.050
And this is going to be fun family one way and then after that would we would want is now of links here

01:13.410 --> 01:15.330
and we would want a list style type.

01:15.330 --> 01:20.190
None because we would want to get rid of these both in points which we can see right now because we

01:20.190 --> 01:22.710
got over the padding right but they're still there.

01:22.710 --> 01:29.940
So I'm going to say and have links and what I'm going to say a list style type here and I'm going to

01:29.940 --> 01:36.300
say in and then we're going to do a rule here we're going to sell property and I'm going to say this

01:36.300 --> 01:41.270
plane but what I'm going to do right away I'm going to copping actually common this one out.

01:41.460 --> 01:41.820
Right.

01:41.970 --> 01:47.400
And the reason for that why we're using this plane on is first I want to style them and then actually

01:47.400 --> 01:49.090
have this rule right.

01:49.110 --> 01:52.550
And the reason for this rule is that once we go to the smaller screen.

01:52.820 --> 01:53.440
Right.

01:53.610 --> 01:55.470
What I want to do is once I refresh.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.900
Right I want this links to be gone.

01:58.910 --> 01:59.380
All right.

01:59.520 --> 02:05.070
And only when I click the button or where right then I want them to actually appear and because otherwise

02:05.070 --> 02:10.320
if I'm not using the display on there all the time once I go to the small screen aren't going to be

02:10.320 --> 02:11.280
like this.

02:11.280 --> 02:12.320
And that's not what I want.

02:12.330 --> 02:17.460
Actually once I refresh the page I want them to be gone like this and only when I click the button I

02:17.460 --> 02:19.020
want them to appear.

02:19.050 --> 02:20.190
So what are you going do over here.

02:20.180 --> 02:22.810
I'm going to say of lengths right now we have this play out.

02:22.890 --> 02:27.930
And later on once we have styled them once you can actually see what we're doing then I'm going to come

02:27.930 --> 02:32.400
and this one again out and here we're going to say is this is going to be Nav..

02:32.620 --> 02:38.970
We're going to say links and we're going to Target or here the element right here we're going to we're

02:38.970 --> 02:41.910
going to be targeting is the links going on here.

02:41.910 --> 02:44.390
First I'm going to say this play and I'm going to say this play.

02:44.390 --> 02:45.990
BLOCK So what's happening now.

02:45.990 --> 02:47.820
They're displaying all across the screen.

02:47.880 --> 02:48.200
Right.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.510
100 percent.

02:49.830 --> 02:53.090
Then we're going to have a padding and padding all around.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.420
We're going to have a 20.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.050
Right.

02:55.120 --> 02:59.950
And the reason for display block is that you can see or hear as I'm hovering right doesn't mean I don't

03:00.000 --> 03:03.130
need to be on here in order for the link to work.

03:03.140 --> 03:03.640
All right.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.910
So this is going to be panning 20.

03:05.910 --> 03:12.840
Then we'll have a background hash tag 1 9 1 9 1 9 is going to be the black one that we're going to have

03:12.900 --> 03:14.670
a font size.

03:14.670 --> 03:20.840
This is going to be 17 pixels right here then we're going to have a text declaration for these on the

03:20.850 --> 03:26.220
lines to be done to have a noun like this.

03:26.310 --> 03:34.380
Then we're going to have a text transform uppercase text transformable we want to have a uppercase and

03:34.380 --> 03:36.560
so now these links are going to look like this.

03:36.750 --> 03:41.210
And then we're going to that car and the color over here is going to be a hash tag.

03:41.460 --> 03:50.280
This is going to be 8 F C and then we're here then we're going to have a B F D B if the order.

03:50.340 --> 03:55.100
So this is going to be this light blue color red and we're going to be using this quite often.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.220
And then we would want a transition.

03:57.340 --> 04:02.100
And so here you can see that as I'm hovering right fewer things are happening the colors are changing

04:02.100 --> 04:06.690
and the background is changing and the batting you can see or hear is changing and all those things

04:06.690 --> 04:07.910
you can actually do.

04:09.070 --> 04:10.330
With the transition.

04:10.570 --> 04:14.690
And basically what we're saying is that we would want that change to happen over time.

04:14.710 --> 04:19.210
I think we can still just do it on a hover right but it's not going to look very pretty if we're doing

04:19.210 --> 04:20.230
without transition.

04:20.230 --> 04:23.060
Basically it's going to right away happen right.

04:23.110 --> 04:24.550
So what's what's happening on here.

04:24.550 --> 04:31.720
We're going to say transition here and we're going to say color 2 seconds is then we're going to have

04:31.750 --> 04:33.590
a background here.

04:33.730 --> 04:34.600
Two seconds each.

04:34.610 --> 04:37.370
So these would be the properties that were in effect right.

04:37.410 --> 04:40.350
These and all here will have a padding.

04:40.660 --> 04:41.840
Two seconds each.

04:42.030 --> 04:46.040
And let me go over what we're actually writing or here is right.

04:46.090 --> 04:51.180
So what's happening is first what I'm saying what property shouldn't be affected by transition then

04:51.190 --> 04:53.130
I'm saying how long this should take.

04:53.170 --> 04:59.360
And I always use these two seconds because I just want us to see actual property that's changing right.

04:59.410 --> 05:03.930
Most case scenarios you're also going to use something like 0.5 seconds or something like this right.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.700
Because two seconds is quite long here.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.320
This is what I'm saying how this transition should happen.

05:09.330 --> 05:10.000
Right.

05:10.030 --> 05:14.060
Does it start faster and faster or easier.

05:14.090 --> 05:18.080
Now there's another option right now I'm just going with a pretty generic one with an ease.

05:18.110 --> 05:18.690
Right.

05:19.020 --> 05:23.610
And here or here I'm saying another property right is going to be the background again.

05:23.620 --> 05:26.540
Two seconds each then another one is going to be bad.

05:26.610 --> 05:26.950
Right.

05:27.100 --> 05:30.990
So basically what I'm saying are here these are going to be the properties that are going to be affected.

05:31.150 --> 05:33.970
And all here now going to write what should actually happen.

05:34.130 --> 05:36.870
So I'm going to say now I have links here.

05:37.050 --> 05:37.670
And however.

05:37.710 --> 05:38.190
All right.

05:38.220 --> 05:40.400
So I was I'm having de-link what should happen.

05:40.540 --> 05:47.450
And once we have a link cover first thing we're going to say is going to be background background and

05:47.450 --> 05:52.250
we're going to say all here hashtag this is going to be nine one and one and one.

05:52.320 --> 05:58.820
And so as I'm hovering the background check right you can see that my is changing over two seconds as

05:58.820 --> 05:59.940
I'm hovering.

05:59.940 --> 06:02.750
Then after that what you want is a color.

06:03.080 --> 06:09.200
And we would want a color to change and what would be the color we're going to say or the hash tag 0

06:09.230 --> 06:18.730
3 2 and then we're going to say for three four three or say this and over here we can see as we're hovering.

06:18.730 --> 06:20.090
Two things are changing right.

06:20.090 --> 06:21.540
Background and color.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.600
And after that all we want is padding left.

06:24.650 --> 06:30.170
So I'm going to say we're here padding and we're going to say padding left and over here this is going

06:30.170 --> 06:31.430
to be 20 pixels.

06:31.460 --> 06:34.180
So we save this note here you can see what's happening.

06:34.220 --> 06:34.770
Right.

06:34.790 --> 06:40.100
So this is going to be on here instead of 20 sorry you know what let's do 30 because 20 wouldn't be

06:40.100 --> 06:40.970
exactly the same.

06:40.970 --> 06:42.420
That's why nothing was happening.

06:42.680 --> 06:48.060
Over here as you can see right now right as I'm hovering and it's actually changing also on the padding

06:48.190 --> 06:48.510
right.

06:48.530 --> 06:53.510
Not just a color in the background and once we're done with these three.

06:53.510 --> 06:56.390
Now would be the time for the icons.

06:56.570 --> 06:58.450
However what's going to happen with icons.

06:58.490 --> 07:01.610
I don't want them to actually appear on a smaller screen.

07:01.780 --> 07:03.840
So over here with the nav icons.

07:03.900 --> 07:04.850
What are all going to do over here.

07:04.850 --> 07:11.950
I'm going to say now comes icons and I'm going to say this play I'm going to say actually this plane

07:12.760 --> 07:19.430
edition totally didn't disappear once we're working with a smaller screen right now then what I would

07:19.430 --> 07:25.160
want to do is deal with this not contain it or hear what I'm going to say that this is going to be in.

07:25.740 --> 07:32.510
And I'm going to see that container container doing this and I'm going to say first and this should

07:32.510 --> 07:39.140
have a padding of zero bottom and 20 pixels left and right here like this.

07:39.140 --> 07:45.320
Then I'm going to add a background and the background is going to be here and then I'm going to say

07:45.400 --> 07:54.650
2:55 255 and 255 0.4 And so it's going to be completely white collar.

07:54.680 --> 08:01.550
However that person is going to be 0.5 or hear like this and it's going to be better seen once you can

08:01.550 --> 08:03.950
actually have this background event.

08:04.050 --> 08:04.640
Right.

08:04.670 --> 08:06.690
So this is how it's going to look eventually.

08:06.740 --> 08:09.990
Now obviously everything is white so we can see the difference.

08:10.050 --> 08:14.580
No here now would want a broader bottom more bottom.

08:14.870 --> 08:20.300
And this is going to be five pixels solid here like this.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.350
And then we're going to have a hash tag.

08:22.400 --> 08:29.670
This is going to be FCB and this is going to be a 8 year sorry a mistake.

08:29.960 --> 08:34.710
So we're going to have eight FCB and if is going to have the.

08:34.770 --> 08:35.330
All right.

08:35.330 --> 08:37.650
So light blue color over here.

08:37.990 --> 08:43.550
And I would want a display flex number for the work on display flex.

08:43.550 --> 08:46.830
What I would want to do is actually create these elements so we can see them.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.840
And so for the container image first I would want to change the size.

08:50.840 --> 08:57.120
All right so now I'm selecting this image or what I'm going to say here that this is going to be a with

08:57.920 --> 09:01.380
here of hundred pixels here.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.660
All right so this is going to be hundred pixels.

09:03.920 --> 09:09.620
And then over here would want another flex properties and we're not going to add right now because we're

09:09.620 --> 09:11.920
not working on a flex yet or here.

09:11.940 --> 09:15.950
Now let's go ahead and let's actually work with this button.

09:16.000 --> 09:16.570
All right.

09:16.580 --> 09:24.680
So let's create the button so we can see or I'm going to say bar one and bar two and bar three.

09:24.680 --> 09:28.660
So all the bars that were created would be in the bottom more.

09:28.830 --> 09:30.320
Three more here.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.930
Now I would want a with.

09:33.150 --> 09:39.990
And this is going to be 25 pixels then we're going to have a height of four pixels here.

09:40.070 --> 09:43.110
They're going to have a margin of five pixels.

09:43.110 --> 09:45.500
Now let's add the color so we can see what we're doing.

09:45.570 --> 09:46.230
All right.

09:46.230 --> 09:51.370
So again we're going to have a background and we're going to we're going to use this light color so

09:51.360 --> 09:55.130
I'm going to copy and paste this here like this.

09:55.150 --> 09:58.600
Right now I can see or hear this is going to be our button.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.750
Right so if I go over here you can see these three lines right.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.890
So this is going to be about an hour here.

10:04.140 --> 10:11.070
And once we have this what I'm going to say or here is now I would want to work actually on the button

10:11.850 --> 10:14.640
so I'm going to say over here this is going to be between.

10:15.140 --> 10:19.000
And here this is going to be padding is going to be two pixels all around.

10:19.320 --> 10:24.900
And then we're going to have a display an inline block like this.

10:24.900 --> 10:32.610
Then we'll have a border border here and we're going to say we're here and this is going to be for pixels

10:33.000 --> 10:33.960
solid.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.550
And again we're going to use this light Great color over here.

10:36.570 --> 10:37.060
Right.

10:37.320 --> 10:42.750
And then we have a cursor going to say cursor and this is going to be a pointer.

10:43.140 --> 10:45.410
So cursor and pointer.

10:45.510 --> 10:49.340
So once we have these now we would want to use the flex box to actually line them up.

10:49.350 --> 10:49.950
All right.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.980
So we're going to go back to now container.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.120
And over here we're going to send this play.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.520
I'm going to say flex.

10:56.820 --> 11:02.780
So now there is play flex then we'll have a justified content space between.

11:03.270 --> 11:05.560
So now they look like this or here.

11:05.610 --> 11:13.530
Then if we're going to go back to Nav. container so we're going to say a line self here self and we're

11:13.530 --> 11:14.760
going to say Center.

11:14.970 --> 11:19.790
So right away when we're doing we're placing all here this image right.

11:19.800 --> 11:25.210
It's not anymore stretched right because by default the flex box is always going to stretch its elements

11:25.210 --> 11:25.690
like this.

11:25.710 --> 11:26.220
Right.

11:26.220 --> 11:31.250
So what we're doing here we're saying we don't want to be stretch we saying lines self center.

11:31.440 --> 11:37.590
And then after that we want to do is work over here with this button right and actually have the same

11:37.590 --> 11:38.150
thing.

11:38.370 --> 11:43.890
So I'm going to say over here a line self We're going to say Center.

11:43.980 --> 11:44.800
That's right.

11:44.810 --> 11:51.220
So now both of them are actually aligned or here in the center and now what we actually care about is

11:51.610 --> 11:53.120
this change.

11:53.160 --> 11:57.700
I so here you can see that as I'm pressing right something is happening.

11:57.700 --> 12:02.620
Well two things are happening first of all which are you see or hear all our elements are appearing

12:02.740 --> 12:03.880
and disappearing.

12:03.880 --> 12:04.440
Right.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.670
But also here these bars are changing.

12:06.940 --> 12:07.520
Right.

12:07.540 --> 12:11.130
And let's actually create a class that actually does this change.

12:11.260 --> 12:11.480
Right.

12:11.500 --> 12:16.690
So what I'm going to say here and there's going to be a class that's going to be called change here

12:17.110 --> 12:23.260
and the change once I have the class change the bar one or here is going to have one effect.

12:23.260 --> 12:23.940
Right.

12:23.980 --> 12:26.520
And the effect is going to be transform.

12:26.530 --> 12:31.920
We're here and we're going to say rotate and we're going to say negative 45 degrees.

12:32.070 --> 12:32.590
Right.

12:32.860 --> 12:34.650
And then we'll have a translator.

12:34.870 --> 12:35.120
Right.

12:35.150 --> 12:37.260
Why not just rotate but also translate.

12:37.580 --> 12:44.460
And we're going to say negative 7 pixels here and this is going to be six pixels like this.

12:44.470 --> 12:48.940
So this was four bar one and you can see or hear what's happening right.

12:48.940 --> 12:58.350
So the bar one translate and transform and bar three over bar two we're just actually deleting it.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.550
We're just we're setting opacity of zero.

13:01.720 --> 13:07.590
So I'm saying here is that we can copy and paste this here two more times.

13:07.810 --> 13:13.560
And this class is going to have an effect on different effect on the bar to it.

13:13.570 --> 13:20.500
So this is going to be this more and we're going to say we're here and this is going to be opacity of

13:20.590 --> 13:21.860
0 4.

13:21.900 --> 13:22.220
All right.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.110
So this is going to disappear.

13:24.130 --> 13:31.840
And then for the March 3 again we're going to have a two of the same things rotate is going to be instead

13:31.840 --> 13:33.760
of negative 45 right.

13:33.790 --> 13:36.770
This is the bar three with one actually lift that up.

13:36.790 --> 13:44.020
So this is going to be 45 degrees and this is going to be negative 7 and negative 8 so negative.

13:44.410 --> 13:50.920
Now what is missing or here is the fact that again I want this change to happen over time.

13:50.920 --> 13:54.200
So I'm going to go back over here to the barge right here.

13:54.310 --> 13:58.260
We're going to write that this is going to be a transition here.

13:58.570 --> 14:05.920
And again we'll have a what property should be effect and then we have a transform and we have opacity.

14:06.010 --> 14:12.100
So these are two properties I don't worry about these values because we care only about properties.

14:12.100 --> 14:18.580
So we're going to we're going to have a transform and this is going to be two seconds each and opacity

14:19.740 --> 14:21.540
also two seconds.

14:21.630 --> 14:23.220
So this is going to be for the bars.

14:23.310 --> 14:28.010
But again this class is going to be only affected once we actually work with the Jake work right.

14:28.020 --> 14:33.090
It's not going to appear anywhere in our HD and now we're actually only have this class once we press

14:33.090 --> 14:36.560
the button and we're going to do it with the help of Jake.

14:36.750 --> 14:40.170
So let's head actually and let's go and let's set it up.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.410
This button that it wouldn't work.

14:42.430 --> 14:42.980
Right.

14:43.050 --> 14:47.950
So what I'm going to do or here I'm going to go back to my script readers or here.

14:47.980 --> 14:50.810
Right we have now a document ready function.

14:50.820 --> 14:53.070
All right we have everything more.

14:53.660 --> 14:58.770
And over here what I'm going to say first right once I click the button I would want Actually these

14:58.770 --> 15:00.270
links to appear and disappear.

15:00.610 --> 15:00.860
Right.

15:00.930 --> 15:06.710
So I'm going to say we're here and then I would want to select a button right or hit class Button.

15:06.780 --> 15:11.960
And so this is the class with the button we're going to play is not and will say click.

15:12.000 --> 15:17.610
So once we actually click it right now or hear what should happen here we're going to have a anonymous

15:17.610 --> 15:20.210
function again like this.

15:20.310 --> 15:26.390
And within this anonymous function we're going right over here that these now have links right.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.720
Something shouldn't happen to them.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.240
Right.

15:28.260 --> 15:35.980
So first of all we need to do is select them like this and we're going to have links right and over

15:36.000 --> 15:39.780
here we're going to say that this is going to be a slide toggle.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.070
Right and that's the function we're interested in here.

15:43.090 --> 15:47.470
We're going to say that this should happen over a span of time.

15:47.510 --> 15:48.030
Right.

15:48.060 --> 15:48.800
All right.

15:48.840 --> 15:49.830
Three seconds.

15:49.980 --> 15:54.020
Now again this is a little bit over exaggerated right.

15:54.030 --> 15:59.530
Probably you would want something quicker but I just like it when it's actually happening longer or

15:59.570 --> 16:02.570
here like this because then we can actually see what's happening.

16:02.670 --> 16:07.320
What I'm going to do or here I'm just going to say this right a novel length slide toggle.

16:07.560 --> 16:08.970
Let's actually see what happens.

16:09.000 --> 16:09.510
Right.

16:09.540 --> 16:10.290
Is it working.

16:10.290 --> 16:11.490
Sure enough right.

16:11.490 --> 16:16.620
So as I'm clicking on here you can see that links are appearing and actually disappear.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.770
Right now what we want to do.

16:18.990 --> 16:19.680
All right.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.970
We would want to actually see what would be the issue.

16:22.980 --> 16:23.370
Right.

16:23.520 --> 16:29.280
So I'm going to go back to our Codemasters site and you can see that once I refresh these links are

16:29.280 --> 16:30.400
always here right.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.640
And remember what we needed to do.

16:32.640 --> 16:38.100
We went to Maine back to Maine she says we're going to go back to now links in or here this plane.

16:38.120 --> 16:38.420
Right.

16:38.430 --> 16:42.400
And what I'm going to do here now they're actually disappearing by default.

16:42.580 --> 16:46.850
All right so if I'm saying this and if I refresh or hear not exceeded they're gone.

16:46.860 --> 16:51.190
However as I press it right now my links are actually up here right.

16:51.300 --> 16:56.140
Because obviously you can see later on once you're going to go back to the different screen right.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.520
There's going to be different.

16:57.690 --> 16:59.400
And that's the reason for that.

16:59.400 --> 17:07.640
Now what I also want to do is add here does change remember this class right through these bars on this.

17:07.700 --> 17:08.120
Right.

17:08.130 --> 17:09.880
So how do I do that.

17:10.170 --> 17:12.450
We're going to go back to a now.

17:12.660 --> 17:17.630
I'm certain the script right and everything is happening as I'm pressing the button.

17:17.630 --> 17:24.120
All right so still within the curly braces and all hinges parentheses what are we going to say or here

17:24.540 --> 17:30.570
is that we will once again for the button you know this we're going to say we will want to select the

17:30.570 --> 17:31.640
actual button.

17:31.890 --> 17:32.070
Right.

17:32.070 --> 17:34.900
So instead of selecting a number of links.

17:35.070 --> 17:41.130
Now we want to select the actual button on here and all this is going to again have a toggle class.

17:41.130 --> 17:46.290
Basically we're going to add the change class once we click click in once and then remove it and we

17:46.290 --> 17:52.170
can do this by doing this toggle class once or here we're going to say we're here to change what what

17:52.250 --> 17:56.070
is the class name we're going to say on here and this is going to be change.

17:56.220 --> 17:56.540
Right.

17:56.580 --> 18:00.570
Once we have this I can say with over here and you can see what's happening.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.700
Right as I click it.

18:02.700 --> 18:05.050
Right now the bars are working here.

18:05.160 --> 18:09.270
Click it again and the change is actually not work right.

18:09.270 --> 18:17.250
So basically we do this by just going all this class then once we're done with this we can actually

18:17.250 --> 18:21.340
go ahead and can work all here on this banner.
