Now that we are in essence we created or hear again comments and then know here we're going to say this

00:06.690 --> 00:10.860
is going to be hash tag customers here like this.

00:10.860 --> 00:15.100
And then we're going to say padding let's say 40 pixels we're here like this right.

00:15.110 --> 00:19.100
So padding around then we're going to have a background.

00:19.560 --> 00:24.060
And this is going to be hash tag 1 9 1 9 1 9 and like this.

00:24.180 --> 00:25.790
And then we're going to have customer.

00:26.100 --> 00:30.280
So it's a dot customer are you doing this.

00:30.310 --> 00:33.740
And then we're going to say this is going to be color here right.

00:33.780 --> 00:44.810
So now we're dealing with each customer and this is going to be here if 5 1/2 5 5 5 5 we're like this

00:44.880 --> 00:50.550
it's going to be the color of a text align center like this.

00:50.590 --> 00:55.590
And my 20 pixels and 0.

00:55.650 --> 01:04.850
So again 20 pixels in between and zero on the site that we're going to have a customer image customer

01:04.940 --> 01:16.250
image here image and then we're going to have a border radius border radius let's say over here 50 percent

01:16.710 --> 01:24.390
year on this and then I'm going to say Max I'm here with and I'm going to say 200 pixels so and never

01:24.420 --> 01:28.850
it's going to be bigger than 200 pixels and it doesn't matter on the screen size is always going to

01:28.850 --> 01:30.620
be 200 pixels like this.

01:30.650 --> 01:33.920
All right then we're going to have a customer.

01:34.100 --> 01:36.370
This is going to be heading three.

01:36.420 --> 01:39.940
We're all going to say margin 10 pixels.

01:40.070 --> 01:47.930
And this is going to be 0 then after We're going to be text transform we're going to say capitalize

01:48.610 --> 01:56.300
on this and the color is going to be the blue one to be here 9 8 F 0.

01:56.320 --> 02:03.020
I really like this and then we're going to have a customer having five customer paragraph.

02:03.020 --> 02:05.650
So what are we going right over here customer.

02:05.810 --> 02:07.790
And this is going to be having five.

02:08.060 --> 02:17.520
So what we would want is we would want text transform uppercase this and then we're going to say that

02:17.560 --> 02:24.260
this is going to be a killer and we're going to have a color over here of 9 5 9 5 9 5.

02:24.420 --> 02:31.570
So hashtag 9 5 9 5 9 5 1 here and the last one is going to be paragraph.

02:31.680 --> 02:36.000
So I'm going to say we're here customer and we're off.

02:36.110 --> 02:41.440
This is going to be A-line high at one point five like this.

02:41.780 --> 02:47.950
And then we're going to have a with with it's going to be 75 percent more here right.

02:48.230 --> 02:54.380
But since we want to place it in the center we're going to see margin top bottom 10 pixels here and

02:54.530 --> 02:58.940
on the side and it's on our placing them over here in the center.

02:59.030 --> 03:04.730
And after that we would want to add media queries for responsiveness.
