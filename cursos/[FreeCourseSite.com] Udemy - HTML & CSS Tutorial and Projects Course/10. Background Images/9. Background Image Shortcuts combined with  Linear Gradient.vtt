WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:06.660
At this point we can have a look how we can combine gradients with background images and as a side note

00:06.750 --> 00:13.230
I purposely delete the previous lectures and recreate a new age thing a malcontent almost each and every

00:13.230 --> 00:13.890
time.

00:14.010 --> 00:19.440
Because while it might seem like a waste of time I think it helps us with our muscle memory where we

00:19.440 --> 00:23.450
can get comfortable with typing actually email as well as we assess.

00:23.460 --> 00:26.910
I mean I might be wrong but that is my reasoning behind it.

00:26.940 --> 00:28.320
So what we're gonna build right now.

00:28.500 --> 00:33.650
Well like I said we will gonna delete everything that we created before just so we can get comfortable

00:33.660 --> 00:38.580
by typing into the amounts we assess as well as we can get rid of these guys.

00:38.650 --> 00:43.120
There's gonna be new ideas and for the new devs we're gonna have two of them.

00:43.290 --> 00:49.890
The first one is gonna be just a let's say simple Dev just gonna say hello world for this one Let's

00:49.890 --> 00:50.610
call this one.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.000
I don't know.

00:51.010 --> 00:56.970
Class and banner and now I can copy and paste this and let's say that there's going to be another div

00:57.420 --> 01:03.490
which we're gonna have the class of header as well as this is going to say hello people.

01:03.780 --> 01:07.490
Again not too original but I think this is gonna do.

01:07.590 --> 01:08.280
So far so good.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.360
We have two ideas.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.980
What are we gonna have here.

01:11.010 --> 01:11.900
Within our styles.

01:11.910 --> 01:12.940
Yes.

01:13.440 --> 01:18.390
We can first start by selecting the both of the devs and setup them in height.

01:18.430 --> 01:24.800
I'm going to say for both devs we would want to have the main height of let's say hundreds of new heights.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.950
This should be looking really good.

01:27.060 --> 01:31.670
Then we're looking for the background images so we'd like to place background images on both.

01:32.130 --> 01:32.670
And you know what.

01:32.710 --> 01:39.840
Now let's first add it in the center again we haven't covered this technically but we're gonna say display

01:40.110 --> 01:42.730
flex so display should be flex.

01:42.990 --> 01:45.270
After that we have a line items in the center.

01:45.270 --> 01:48.450
So this is gonna place it the vertical in the center.

01:48.520 --> 01:54.470
And let me get her this guy and justify content is also gonna be center as well as text the line shouldn't

01:54.470 --> 01:55.500
be in the center.

01:55.530 --> 01:58.230
So in this case we're going to be placing everything in the center.

01:58.230 --> 02:00.290
So the text is gonna be in center center.

02:00.390 --> 02:01.320
And you know what.

02:01.320 --> 02:05.790
Let's add font size again and with 60 pixels and color.

02:05.790 --> 02:08.680
I don't know maybe let's try something else.

02:08.730 --> 02:10.490
So what we're gonna have for a color.

02:10.500 --> 02:11.070
We're gonna get.

02:11.070 --> 02:11.610
I don't know.

02:11.790 --> 02:12.520
Orange.

02:12.540 --> 02:14.560
Something like this should work fine.

02:14.790 --> 02:15.890
We will save it.

02:15.980 --> 02:17.930
And what are we going to have next.

02:17.940 --> 02:20.660
Now we would like to start working with a banner.

02:20.670 --> 02:25.340
Let's say I want to say for the banner we already know that we have an option of background.

02:25.450 --> 02:28.040
Now for the background we know that we can use the image.

02:28.370 --> 02:31.170
And now let's again use most of the big images.

02:31.230 --> 02:33.040
So I'm going to say Big J here.

02:33.060 --> 02:37.430
Now let me add maybe the quotation marks and proper path here.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.890
Let's say I'm gonna be looking for the big JP.

02:40.350 --> 02:41.380
I'm going to save it.

02:41.460 --> 02:46.020
And we already know that we need to add a few more properties because for now this is not going to be

02:46.020 --> 02:47.640
working out really well.

02:47.640 --> 02:52.710
So I'm going to say like this we're going gonna say starting with background and we're looking for what

02:52.890 --> 02:54.180
we're looking for.

02:54.450 --> 03:00.190
Repeat or maybe let's start with a plus size let's say size is going to be first.

03:00.190 --> 03:03.810
We're all going to be covering so this size should cover.

03:03.810 --> 03:05.130
Then what else we had.

03:05.280 --> 03:05.780
And you know what.

03:05.790 --> 03:07.350
Let's get that quotation mark.

03:07.780 --> 03:08.400
We'll save it.

03:08.400 --> 03:13.080
So now the size is covering and we also had background repeat.

03:13.140 --> 03:22.130
Let's say no repeat and position is gonna be center background positioning is going to be in the center.

03:22.140 --> 03:23.600
So so far so good.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.140
And what else we're having.

03:25.140 --> 03:27.420
Well I think the last one was what the attachment.

03:27.420 --> 03:27.630
Right.

03:27.630 --> 03:32.800
So we had background attachment and this is going to be fixed.

03:32.830 --> 03:33.500
Awesome.

03:33.510 --> 03:36.960
We have our setup with the banner.

03:36.960 --> 03:37.650
Now what's next.

03:38.340 --> 03:43.110
Well now I'd like to show you how we can work with linear gradients and what kind of issue we would

03:43.110 --> 03:44.040
be solving.

03:44.040 --> 03:44.710
And you know what.

03:44.760 --> 03:49.130
I know that this is gonna be weird but this is a little bit bugging me is margins here.

03:49.140 --> 03:54.540
So again let's do that little thing what we did with the rest of the elements so we said all the elements

03:54.920 --> 04:02.130
it's going to have some margin of zero adding a zero and the box sizing is going to be equal to let's

04:02.130 --> 04:03.700
say box.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.410
So now I'm gonna get her of these margins.

04:05.610 --> 04:06.560
Okay.

04:06.690 --> 04:13.170
And the issue that linear gradient is gonna solve is the fact that right now if you're saying if we

04:13.170 --> 04:17.350
would have an image you wouldn't be in some cases able to see the text.

04:17.460 --> 04:24.030
So let's say in our case we technically could see the text but I think that if the image would be any

04:24.030 --> 04:27.770
brighter it's gonna be much more hard to see the text.

04:27.810 --> 04:32.300
So the solution we can do is we can place an overlay using the linear gradient.

04:32.430 --> 04:33.810
So how this is gonna work out.

04:34.140 --> 04:39.420
Well I'm going to show you this however I'm going to show you this on the second one on header just

04:39.420 --> 04:40.440
so we can see the difference.

04:40.440 --> 04:45.270
First of all and I'm also gonna show you how we can shortcut this because you're probably looking at

04:45.270 --> 04:47.680
this and you're like well this is really annoying.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.990
We're technically really typing for properties here with the values.

04:51.990 --> 04:54.290
So isn't there a shorter way how we can do that.

04:54.450 --> 04:55.590
And since it is.

04:55.590 --> 04:56.470
Yes yes yes.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.000
There is a shorter way.

04:58.050 --> 05:02.380
So in this case we're gonna say her so I'm gonna say we're gonna start looking for that.

05:02.540 --> 05:04.390
So that would be my first thing.

05:04.430 --> 05:07.380
Again let me set up a nice curly braces.

05:07.550 --> 05:09.190
And then what I would want for the Hatter.

05:09.320 --> 05:14.720
Well I'm going to start the same thing but instead of right away going with an image we have an option

05:14.720 --> 05:16.620
of adding the linear gradient.

05:16.730 --> 05:17.960
So let's start here.

05:17.960 --> 05:22.640
Let's say that there is gonna be a linear gradient and now I'd like to decide on a color.

05:22.700 --> 05:28.160
Now well what kind of colors we can have I guess we can start with maybe black one.

05:28.310 --> 05:31.210
Maybe this is gonna make this image less bright.

05:31.370 --> 05:35.870
So we know that we can have a higher GPA than we need to have the karma.

05:35.870 --> 05:37.710
So that would be the proper syntax.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.800
And again another R GPA.

05:40.070 --> 05:43.750
Before that before all the examples I was using one color.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.060
And then there was some second color.

05:46.100 --> 05:51.880
However if I would want let's say everything to be in the same color I can just add the same color so

05:51.890 --> 05:53.510
I can say 0 0 0.

05:53.510 --> 05:59.360
So that would be my black one and linear gradient here is gonna be zero point five and I can do the

05:59.360 --> 06:00.200
same thing here.

06:00.200 --> 06:08.810
I can say zero again comma zero and let me make this properly zero then that is gonna be my third zero

06:08.810 --> 06:13.360
I believe and then I'm adding my fourth one zero point five.

06:13.550 --> 06:15.630
Let me check Yeah I have five.

06:15.640 --> 06:21.970
No I going to have one extra zero because this is technically wrapping here so now let me say it and

06:21.980 --> 06:28.970
now I have my great color because I obviously this is exactly the same where I'm having my GPA one value

06:29.180 --> 06:32.440
as was the second value is exactly the same.

06:32.450 --> 06:36.980
So this is the reason why this is not starting from somewhere and ending somewhere.

06:36.980 --> 06:41.720
Well technically it is right behind the scenes we're starting from the top but we're ending with the

06:41.720 --> 06:47.810
bottom because we haven't set any kind of direction but since this is the same color everything's looks

06:47.810 --> 06:48.290
the same.

06:48.290 --> 06:49.370
Everything is unison.

06:49.420 --> 06:52.530
Now if I'm going to change this I'm going to say zero point one.

06:52.570 --> 06:57.530
Notice that right now it's gonna starting from the top where this will gonna be bright and then we're

06:57.530 --> 06:59.530
heading over here where this would be darker.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.660
But again I would want it to be the same.

07:01.820 --> 07:04.500
Once we have added successfully our linear gradient.

07:04.700 --> 07:05.760
Well now what.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.230
Well now we're all gonna work with our image so we're gonna be looking for the image.

07:09.230 --> 07:11.800
However this is important that we're adding here.

07:11.810 --> 07:17.810
This come please don't omit the comma and then you're going to be looking for the mistake because they're

07:17.810 --> 07:21.130
really gonna be a syntax error and here you're gonna say you are.

07:21.330 --> 07:23.720
Since this is we're all going to be looking for damages.

07:23.780 --> 07:29.210
Now I'm going to look for either the folder or we can maybe look for the same image just so we can see

07:29.210 --> 07:30.020
the difference.

07:30.020 --> 07:34.280
I think that would be actually better because that way we can see one image is not gonna have the linear

07:34.280 --> 07:34.960
gradient.

07:35.120 --> 07:41.240
And the second one that would have the linear gradient now the image again was big JPEG so forward slash

07:41.270 --> 07:44.820
then we're looking for the big Jake back and now we're gonna have the image.

07:44.840 --> 07:48.950
Now the question would be you would say well first of all you can right away see the difference.

07:48.950 --> 07:51.480
So we have one that's gonna have no overlay.

07:51.530 --> 07:57.230
And the second one where the text is much more clearer because we have added the overlay.

07:57.230 --> 08:02.590
Now this obviously is not some kind of set overlay that you always need to use.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.430
You can use whatever color you would like.

08:04.430 --> 08:09.470
Like I said before but in my case I'm just showing you with this kind of value just to show you that

08:09.470 --> 08:10.780
it is darker.

08:10.820 --> 08:15.560
And again this is really up to you if you want to use the yellow color as our light you can use the

08:15.560 --> 08:21.270
yellow color sometimes if we're going to do something like this where we have the let's say a logo and

08:21.380 --> 08:24.410
then we're using the same overlay for this picture.

08:24.410 --> 08:30.380
So it doesn't have to be black or white again and that's the reason why you have these are GPA values.

08:30.380 --> 08:35.200
Now lastly I would want to show you is how we can shorten this because for now you would be thinking.

08:35.220 --> 08:40.970
Okay so I have all this I have your l everything is working really well meaning the image but I still

08:40.970 --> 08:42.450
need to add the cover.

08:42.450 --> 08:45.760
No repeat center and all that because right now I have two images.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.260
So I would like to fix that.

08:47.300 --> 08:52.800
Now we can technically write this all out and there's nothing wrong with it but we have a shorter way.

08:52.820 --> 08:57.680
So here we can write that the image is gonna be always in the center because we have the position of

08:57.680 --> 08:58.890
center and you know what.

08:58.900 --> 09:02.860
Maybe let me kind of put them in water how I am putting them here.

09:02.870 --> 09:08.810
So we have the center then we're gonna have forward slash and the color so we can use this and then

09:08.810 --> 09:10.870
we would need to write what we would like to do.

09:10.910 --> 09:12.860
So I'm gonna say no repeat.

09:12.860 --> 09:17.780
And this is gonna be fixed here like this.

09:17.780 --> 09:18.920
And what happened.

09:18.920 --> 09:24.560
Well we have added all these properties without writing actual the properties just by adding the values

09:25.190 --> 09:26.290
not be careful here.

09:26.300 --> 09:32.930
You can change this order so let's say I couldn't say no fixed and then I'm gonna write no repeat.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.670
So this is gonna work fine.

09:34.670 --> 09:36.450
However don't mix these two up.

09:36.530 --> 09:43.670
Don't say it like this don't say cover and center because notice what's gonna happen.

09:43.680 --> 09:44.930
Well the image is not going to be shown.

09:45.350 --> 09:51.080
So these two guys if you're writing them just make sure that you're right center then we have forward

09:51.080 --> 09:56.280
slash and then we're using the color and that way you know for sure that your image is always gonna

09:56.300 --> 09:56.690
be shown.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.730
And this is basically how this is gonna look like.

09:59.780 --> 10:03.040
Let me make save and I think it looks awesome.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.790
I think it looks really good.

10:04.940 --> 10:07.550
And now I can see the text much more clear.
