00:00.480 --> 00:03.960
So the million dollar question how we can create this button.

00:04.400 --> 00:10.260
Oh you might be thinking well we can use probably something like position work and you would be almost

00:10.260 --> 00:10.630
correct.

00:11.250 --> 00:14.000
However as we're scrolling on notice what happens.

00:14.130 --> 00:16.080
So the button stays in place.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.370
So why don't we use the position fixed instead.

00:19.590 --> 00:23.030
First and foremost as always we're going to have to go the indexation email.

00:23.160 --> 00:28.710
But since we're using again position fixed technically you can place this button anywhere you'd like.

00:28.710 --> 00:33.600
Now I just think that logically this makes a little bit of sense if the button is gonna be sitting all

00:33.600 --> 00:34.630
the way on top.

00:34.710 --> 00:36.130
So why don't we write it here.

00:36.300 --> 00:43.050
Let's say that there is gonna be a span and we could make this button ourselves by the divs and all

00:43.050 --> 00:48.580
that but I think there's gonna be a little bit faster if we're just gonna set it up as a phantasm.

00:48.720 --> 00:56.110
I do want to have one class and one I.D. So when I say nav Button class an idea of not a button.

00:56.110 --> 01:00.090
Now the idea is gonna be important because we're gonna use it in jobs.

01:00.570 --> 01:02.370
So that's the reason why I'm adding here.

01:02.380 --> 01:08.280
The idea we could technically use the class as well but for now let's just use the idea for JavaScript.

01:08.280 --> 01:15.990
And this is gonna be for styling and here that's right Phantasm now the name is gonna be a face f a

01:15.990 --> 01:18.270
barge mon we're gonna save it.

01:18.390 --> 01:23.070
And if we're going to head over back on the top notice that we're gonna have to text our.

01:23.070 --> 01:27.190
Now obviously we would want our suggestion and we're gonna have our little icon.

01:27.630 --> 01:28.050
Awesome.

01:28.530 --> 01:29.090
Okay.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.090
What's next.

01:30.190 --> 01:31.960
We're gonna head over back to CSX.

01:31.980 --> 01:35.420
And again we had our NAV bar all the way to the top.

01:35.610 --> 01:40.560
Remember we had the nav bar as well as we had the NAV button.

01:40.580 --> 01:47.390
Now in this case I I think I combined them both where I have the animations ahead of her.

01:47.460 --> 01:49.650
So this is gonna be in the Virgin Skills.

01:49.680 --> 01:52.930
I'm sorry I'm still navigating throughout Navarre.

01:53.010 --> 01:54.530
There is no cure.

01:54.540 --> 01:58.240
Let's say there's gonna be no bar but I can also add maybe nap button.

01:58.240 --> 02:04.080
So I'm just saying now I've beaten and let's add some stars now obviously since we have the class in

02:04.110 --> 02:06.760
just about everything by targeting the class.

02:06.810 --> 02:12.360
So when we say first the heart beating then and like I said we're going to be using position fixed because

02:12.360 --> 02:18.200
what I would like to do is as I'm going over then I would like to see this button somewhere.

02:18.300 --> 02:24.670
What you're noticing right away is that as I'm scrolling below my a header where I had my linear grade

02:24.710 --> 02:25.860
end and everything.

02:25.860 --> 02:29.810
Now I can see the button how serious I'm scrolling on top of it.

02:29.910 --> 02:30.630
We cannot see it.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.650
So in order to fix this we would need to use design.

02:33.730 --> 02:40.260
Remember that one the one that was responsible for Z axis and let just sitting here like something like

02:40.260 --> 02:43.630
one and the moment we do that notice now we can see the button.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.000
So everything is working fine.

02:45.480 --> 02:48.440
Well since we're using position fixed we also would need to place it.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.250
So I'm going to say top zero.

02:50.290 --> 02:52.250
So this is gonna be all the way to the top.

02:52.290 --> 02:53.400
The left hand side.

02:53.580 --> 02:56.660
So for this we're gonna say top 0 left 0.

02:56.850 --> 03:03.810
And let's maybe add some colouring so primary color that's gonna be green right now.

03:03.840 --> 03:10.040
We can also add maybe a little bit of margin one our aim is gonna be Tom bottom one point three.

03:10.070 --> 03:11.520
He is gonna be left and right.

03:11.520 --> 03:17.880
So let's say one point three grams is gonna be left and right.

03:18.420 --> 03:19.920
So it should look something like this.

03:19.920 --> 03:25.910
And this is gonna be our March number maybe we can also make it bigger so font size is gonna be two

03:25.910 --> 03:26.330
or.

03:26.730 --> 03:33.330
However as we're looking at the final project we know this that this is gonna be bouncing and we already

03:33.330 --> 03:35.250
know that we can use the animation for that.

03:35.580 --> 03:36.730
So why don't we set it up.

03:37.230 --> 03:42.360
And like I said before I would like to set up this now very I mean animation right here because I don't

03:42.360 --> 03:47.550
see the point of creating it in all the animations and then going back.

03:47.550 --> 03:52.770
I think this is just gonna make a little bit more sense if we write them here now for animations we

03:52.770 --> 03:58.740
already know the key frames are hard a word that we're looking for then I'm gonna name might bounce

03:59.710 --> 04:01.810
and I'm gonna have few things here.

04:01.990 --> 04:07.030
I'm gonna say at zero percent this is gonna be scaling to nothing.

04:07.090 --> 04:13.180
Meaning this is gonna be transform and transform and then let's read scale.

04:13.180 --> 04:16.140
And this is gonna be one meaning we're not gonna change anything.

04:16.510 --> 04:20.820
However I'd also like to add two more and this is not what I wanted to copy and paste.

04:20.830 --> 04:30.860
So let's say 1 2 and now I'm gonna be looking out for zero percent let's say 5 50 say 5 percent 50 percent.

04:30.880 --> 04:31.670
And you know what.

04:31.670 --> 04:32.830
A hundred percent.

04:32.830 --> 04:34.720
And let's just make this bigger.

04:34.840 --> 04:36.840
And then we're gonna make it back again 1.

04:37.060 --> 04:40.280
So for the 50 percent who's gonna here one point five.

04:40.900 --> 04:47.710
Now since we have already animation setup we can right away right and we can say animation the name

04:47.710 --> 04:52.670
is gonna be bounce of course some animation bounce and then we're looking for what.

04:53.170 --> 04:59.050
Well how long the animation is gonna take place I'm gonna say two seconds then we can say ease in and

04:59.050 --> 04:59.590
out.

04:59.670 --> 05:02.580
So that's gonna be the functioning of the animation.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.530
And let's also add infinite.

05:04.900 --> 05:08.740
So the button right now that button is gonna be bouncing infinitely.

05:09.340 --> 05:14.080
I also would like to add cursor pointer we're just gonna make sure that as I'm hovering I we're gonna

05:14.080 --> 05:16.440
see that I'm gonna have my little cursor.

05:16.440 --> 05:19.280
And yeah and this is how we can set up the NAV button.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.970
We're gonna head over back to the bigger browser window just to check that it's happening.

05:23.410 --> 05:29.170
And the neat thing is that we're all gonna be able to access our navigation all throughout the document

05:29.620 --> 05:31.990
because we have the position fixed.

05:31.990 --> 05:35.170
So regardless of where we're scrolling we're gonna have our button.
