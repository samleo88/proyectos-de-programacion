WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:06.340
Now before we can start working on the project the first thing we would need to do would be a set up.

00:06.510 --> 00:12.870
Now for those of you who do not want to do the set up together with me under the resources for this

00:12.870 --> 00:18.340
video there is going to be a set up folder where everything is already going to be completed.

00:18.420 --> 00:24.840
Now for those of you who actually want to follow First things first and then stop you can see or hear.

00:24.960 --> 00:29.540
We're going to create a folder and I'm just going to say that this is going to be a flex box.

00:29.730 --> 00:34.150
So I'm just gonna say your name and we're going to call this a flex box.

00:34.590 --> 00:40.880
So say we're here and flex marks and let's say Portfolio portfolio here.

00:40.920 --> 00:47.370
Now once I have all here my folder you can see are here and this is going to be my text editor and I'm

00:47.370 --> 00:52.320
just going to go over here and I'm going to say open folder and all here in the desktop.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.080
Hold one open up those flex box put forward.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.800
And once I open up the file over here first things first.

00:58.860 --> 01:00.930
Let's create a index actually.

01:00.970 --> 01:03.600
Now I'm going to say we're here in this age.

01:03.620 --> 01:07.660
You know then I will going to create a main sucess.

01:07.830 --> 01:12.780
So I'm going to call this main see SS and then after that we're going to say that this is going to be

01:12.780 --> 01:13.700
script.

01:13.700 --> 01:14.290
Yes.

01:14.400 --> 01:18.040
So I'm going to say on here this is going to be script genius.

01:18.060 --> 01:23.760
So this is going to be for the nav bar to actually make the button dynamic.

01:23.760 --> 01:29.100
Now once we have created all the files we can go ahead or here and in the next page.

01:29.160 --> 01:34.520
Now we can use the fact that we as code by default has a.

01:34.630 --> 01:38.330
So I'm going to type or here exclamation mark and presto.

01:38.580 --> 01:42.820
And right away I have my HMO Skelton ready for me on here.

01:42.850 --> 01:48.940
Let's just change a title and let's say here and this title is actually going to be portfolio.

01:49.290 --> 01:50.900
For Leo.

01:51.120 --> 01:58.090
Now once I have the actual portfolio ready now I would want to have a live preview.

01:58.290 --> 02:00.520
So for this we have few options.

02:00.510 --> 02:06.960
We can either use a short cut or here if I just right click it you can see that I have my live server.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.660
So we're going to open up live server.

02:09.900 --> 02:16.050
Now before that I'm actually going to open up a new window for my chrome here and just make it a little

02:16.050 --> 02:17.000
bit smaller.

02:17.050 --> 02:23.070
So once you have open up in a live server you can see that right now this is going to be my portfolio.

02:23.370 --> 02:26.520
And what I'm going to do here I'm going to place them side by side.

02:26.680 --> 02:31.750
So I'm going to maximize this guy maximize this guy and I'm going to pull it over here like this.

02:31.980 --> 02:37.250
And just to have more space when I'm going in there work here I'm just going up for now.

02:37.260 --> 02:38.850
Close it out right away.

02:38.850 --> 02:41.020
My side bar or here.

02:41.070 --> 02:44.630
So once we are done with a set up in the tech center.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.840
Now let's let's have a look at what things we would need.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.580
First of all you can see that here this is going to be my images folder and or here you can see that

02:53.670 --> 02:55.350
I already have all the images.

02:55.350 --> 03:00.810
So again if you're going to be downloading with a set up folder you right away you going to have all

03:00.810 --> 03:02.010
these images.

03:02.010 --> 03:03.230
So here's what I'm going to do.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.340
I'm just going to drag re-enters folder.

03:05.540 --> 03:12.700
Now once I have my images in my fluxbox Foro next what I would want is actually funtastic.

03:13.020 --> 03:15.420
So you can see that I am in the font.

03:15.420 --> 03:16.580
Awesome website.

03:16.710 --> 03:22.500
And if you're going to go here and you forgot to click how to use you can see that right away we have

03:22.620 --> 03:27.080
getting started on the web and we're here this is going to be the Cdn.

03:27.240 --> 03:33.570
So basically if I'm going to go to these SPG widgets because this is what I would like to use instead

03:33.570 --> 03:34.520
of weapons.

03:34.720 --> 03:41.280
And if you're just going to copy the script and place it in in your title tags right away you're going

03:41.280 --> 03:42.870
to have a phantasm.

03:42.870 --> 03:46.520
Now what I'm going to do I'm actually going to download some here.

03:46.560 --> 03:51.550
So if you're going to scroll down over here and you can see that we have a download font.

03:51.570 --> 03:52.310
Awesome.

03:52.680 --> 03:58.190
And once I click you can see that it's downloading and or here you can see that help to understand.

03:58.380 --> 04:01.300
And over here this is basically going explain what we need.

04:01.560 --> 04:07.070
So here because I want to work with SVGA the only thing we need is all just fine.

04:07.290 --> 04:13.200
So what I'm going to say here is I'm going to go to my folder wherever I created over here and I'm just

04:13.200 --> 04:18.380
going up and open up this folder and then I'm going to look in the genius for all of.

04:18.390 --> 04:20.430
So this is going to be in the file that I need.

04:20.430 --> 04:24.660
So the only thing that I need is on here just drag this file to my fault.

04:24.890 --> 04:30.520
So once we're done with it found some next we would need a Google fonts.

04:30.690 --> 04:33.340
So we're going to say we're here and we would want Google fonts.

04:33.510 --> 04:37.950
So we're going to open up new fonts now in Google fonts.

04:37.980 --> 04:41.500
I'm actually going to search for a robot own.

04:41.680 --> 04:47.490
So here I'm going to type or borrow and you could see or hear this is going to be my rebozo while I

04:47.490 --> 04:48.800
want cyclical here.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.750
You can see that it's and show me what type of font is out here.

04:52.890 --> 04:58.530
But I would want or hear just to include some are going to press on here to that plus sign and you can

04:58.530 --> 05:00.760
see that it has families like that.

05:00.840 --> 05:04.090
So again we have few options how we can work here.

05:04.230 --> 05:07.920
We can either use the link or we can actually do the import.

05:08.180 --> 05:10.090
And we're actually going to do the import.

05:10.110 --> 05:15.750
So in our success and our main success would actually need to copy and paste.

05:16.020 --> 05:20.500
Now before we do that we're going to do a customized and was going to add some stuff.

05:20.640 --> 05:24.800
So we're going to say that we would want a bold and 700.

05:25.730 --> 05:29.440
So once we have all here we're going to go back to embed.

05:29.610 --> 05:32.060
And I was going to say that we would want to importer's.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.160
So I'm just going to copy and paste this line.

05:34.410 --> 05:35.640
I'm going to say copy.

05:35.760 --> 05:40.990
I'm going to go back more here to my tech center now once in my Thaxter.

05:41.070 --> 05:41.860
I'm going to open up.

05:41.880 --> 05:46.310
Actually my main success and just copy and paste or here my import.

05:46.560 --> 05:50.330
And if you know the story here we also need a font family.

05:50.460 --> 05:52.760
So for this world and to use a body.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.010
So I'm going to say we're here for the body.

05:55.170 --> 05:59.320
And I was going to use this fun family robot go mano a mano space.

05:59.580 --> 06:02.300
So I'm going to copy and paste this over here.

06:02.310 --> 06:05.510
Right now we have in our body our phone family.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.950
So we're going to go back to the index actually and Mail.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.670
And if we're going to say something like Hello world.

06:11.670 --> 06:14.610
So let's type it over here like this.

06:14.610 --> 06:21.050
Let's say that we would want a new one and once we have added one I'm going to say we're here.

06:21.070 --> 06:21.890
This is going to be.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.720
Hello world.

06:23.970 --> 06:28.200
And once I type or hear my heading one you can see that nothing's changed.

06:28.410 --> 06:34.950
And the reason why nothing has changed because we actually need to link the main CSA So here then we

06:34.950 --> 06:37.390
need to link the actual script.

06:37.620 --> 06:41.640
And then we also need to make sure that we have the actual font awesome.

06:41.640 --> 06:47.700
So let's go back to the next issue now and are we're going to say that we would want first to link and

06:47.700 --> 06:50.400
we would want to link the main services.

06:50.450 --> 06:52.820
So first we're going to link the main services.

06:52.830 --> 06:55.520
Once you can see then once I link the main theosis.

06:55.740 --> 07:01.630
Now I can see that my have my own bottle fonts work and I'm thinking that let's right away.

07:01.650 --> 07:06.730
And also the Scripture has to say or here script sort of script.

07:06.740 --> 07:10.810
And for the source we're going to say this is going to be script genius.

07:10.920 --> 07:15.270
No we're not going to test this right now whether we have actually elected correctly.

07:15.390 --> 07:19.240
But as you can see if the names match everything should be worked out.

07:19.450 --> 07:23.410
And after that let's check whether we have some here.

07:23.420 --> 07:30.000
I'm going to say there's going to be a span element and within the span element what I would want is

07:30.000 --> 07:35.010
an eye ailment with the classes of yes a home or here.

07:35.250 --> 07:38.040
And what do FAA and five xo.

07:38.190 --> 07:43.010
So again as you can see it Emmett is right away suggesting what I'm going to have sort of press thiab

07:43.060 --> 07:46.830
save it over here and you can see that I don't have my phone does.

07:46.980 --> 07:53.330
Now I'm going to go up here and we're going to say that we would want to include phone number for that.

07:53.340 --> 07:58.560
Let's actually add a comment not say that this is going to be the main CSSA here.

07:58.770 --> 08:03.530
And for this comment was going to say Fonte an OR here.

08:03.780 --> 08:11.070
Now once I have the common Let's actually link it now for this since this is a javascript file we also

08:11.070 --> 08:12.610
need to do the scriptorium.

08:12.780 --> 08:15.310
So we're going to say or hearing that this is going to be scrapped.

08:15.480 --> 08:19.520
And for the source this time we're just going to say that this is going to be Algie.

08:19.680 --> 08:25.760
So once you say even you can see or hear that now our phone is working and the last thing that out we

08:25.760 --> 08:29.110
want to show you is where we can get images now.

08:29.160 --> 08:35.400
Like I said for those of you who are going to be actually downloading the file the set up folder right

08:35.400 --> 08:43.230
away have the images but oh here are just like a lot of pixels where you can get a high quality and

08:43.230 --> 08:44.430
free image.

08:44.730 --> 08:51.120
So once we are done with our set up we can actually start working on our portfolio project.
