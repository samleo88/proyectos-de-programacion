WEBVTT

00:00.030 --> 00:03.480
A let's go ahead and let's actually get our accordion.

00:03.780 --> 00:09.330
So we're all going to get accordion accordion are actually going to get from Jake worry you want which

00:09.330 --> 00:13.090
is basically built on top of the actual Jake.

00:13.130 --> 00:13.640
All right.

00:13.740 --> 00:21.460
So it's all kinds of nice gooey widgets here for a user interface right.

00:21.490 --> 00:25.790
That's actually built on top of the typical Drake way.

00:25.980 --> 00:28.930
And first we can actually go and see or hear.

00:28.980 --> 00:35.910
We have the mouse right if we would want whether it's Dragon Ball drop or ball resize and we all going

00:35.910 --> 00:37.020
to be actually using.

00:37.090 --> 00:39.760
Like I said again accordion or here right.

00:39.760 --> 00:43.240
So this is what we are interested in getting this accordion.

00:43.470 --> 00:48.270
And we're also going to be using a little bit later progress bars on it like this.

00:48.270 --> 00:53.390
So this is going to be another interesting part right but forever what we need right now.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.390
Right.

00:54.570 --> 01:00.570
We can just go back over here and we're going to need accordion but we obviously need to download it

01:00.630 --> 01:01.150
right.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.960
And we again have two options here.

01:03.970 --> 01:04.300
Right.

01:04.320 --> 01:08.880
If we go with an actual download or we can get a CDN.

01:09.000 --> 01:17.160
So here you go and then this is going to be a where we are here why CDN and let's say go.

01:17.680 --> 01:18.180
Right.

01:18.390 --> 01:21.010
So it's going to go here to a host of libraries.

01:21.210 --> 01:23.120
And in this case we have two things.

01:23.120 --> 01:29.950
All right we just we have a genius on here and this is for the mobile but we need it for you.

01:30.300 --> 01:34.910
So first things first we're going to get a javascript here.

01:34.950 --> 01:40.710
So we're just going to copy this guy over here and we're going to go back to index HD and now scroll

01:40.710 --> 01:44.340
all the way to the bottom and let's say on here this is going to be our script.

01:44.340 --> 01:46.190
This is going to be horizonal right.

01:46.230 --> 01:49.580
But over here let's say these are going to be all our CD-ROMs.

01:49.590 --> 01:56.760
So this is going to say that this is going to be a quirky UI CDN on here.

01:56.850 --> 02:00.360
Copy and paste this is going to be first the google ones.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.130
So let's say when.

02:01.140 --> 02:06.930
But like I said we need to assess and because it's using the things so we're all going to go back out

02:06.960 --> 02:07.630
here.

02:07.890 --> 02:11.630
Copy this and now this one we need to go all the way to the top.

02:11.730 --> 02:18.270
And again after let's say Google fonts let's make a query a y.

02:18.510 --> 02:25.300
C Ss Let's see a CD and CD and then or here again we're going to copy and paste this.

02:25.380 --> 02:27.050
And now we have it.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.260
So now the accordion works.

02:29.350 --> 02:29.550
Right.

02:29.550 --> 02:36.190
And again the best way is to actually go ahead and let's say we're going to go with a Demos find whereas

02:36.210 --> 02:43.110
accordion and or here you can see that right away we have a new source right where we have documentation

02:43.490 --> 02:46.700
and let's say these are or here are going to be the examples right.

02:46.890 --> 02:48.850
But we're going to start with the most basic one.

02:48.950 --> 02:53.850
So we're going to go back over here you can see it right away gives you the source and the key here

02:53.850 --> 02:54.430
is this.

02:54.560 --> 02:54.960
Right.

02:55.110 --> 02:58.990
So basically we need to have a div right now.

02:59.010 --> 03:02.070
Again like I said we could have named ours ones whatever we want.

03:02.070 --> 03:06.760
I just went with the same one just so you understand how everything works right.

03:06.990 --> 03:09.150
And what we need is a section.

03:09.270 --> 03:15.900
And over here Dave S. and they are here they placed the paragraph but it doesn't really matter how we

03:15.900 --> 03:16.520
do it.

03:16.810 --> 03:21.620
All right then after that like I said you can see here that you have a script right.

03:21.630 --> 03:26.910
So obviously you also need to join equerry which we've already done before and on here this is going

03:26.910 --> 03:30.640
to be the UI J.S. and you I see.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.760
SS Right.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.660
What we care about over here is this little accordion.

03:34.660 --> 03:35.310
Right.

03:35.310 --> 03:42.330
So what we're going to say here this is going to be a accordion here and you can just copy and where

03:42.330 --> 03:44.150
we can copy this right.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.600
And we're actually going to copy it in our script.

03:46.680 --> 03:49.450
I remember the script when we had for the slide.

03:49.450 --> 03:50.080
All right.

03:50.100 --> 03:55.160
Going to make a comment and say Right because this is still Geck worry.

03:55.280 --> 03:56.990
And this is still javascript.

03:57.150 --> 03:58.940
We saved this one over here.

03:58.950 --> 04:01.820
Now I can see right away we have a recording on it.

04:01.980 --> 04:08.030
Now we know that everything is work now a second would work the same thing here if we would have a Firefox

04:08.040 --> 04:08.790
right.

04:08.850 --> 04:11.000
So let's refresh here.

04:11.010 --> 04:11.430
Right.

04:11.580 --> 04:13.140
And this is going to be our accordion.

04:13.350 --> 04:17.270
And you can see how many things right happened by default.

04:17.340 --> 04:17.700
Right.

04:17.850 --> 04:22.370
So technically if you're happy with this right you can actually live like this right.

04:22.390 --> 04:25.570
You know right away you got the accordion and everything is work.

04:25.590 --> 04:32.430
However what we all want is we would want to style it all right and how we would actually style this

04:32.780 --> 04:35.840
or here we're going to go back to Google.

04:35.940 --> 04:36.560
Right.

04:36.630 --> 04:38.520
And this is going to be the recording.

04:38.650 --> 04:43.380
Right so again we can refresh because we have saved this right and again of course.

04:43.710 --> 04:50.680
Now if I go to Google of all particles and I'm going to say inspect on here notice something interation

04:50.760 --> 04:51.430
right.

04:51.750 --> 04:55.200
You have a heading three here.

04:55.410 --> 05:03.800
You buy accordion Hetter And then if we go to the Dave read this is going to be UI accordion content.

05:04.030 --> 05:04.540
Right.

05:04.610 --> 05:10.790
And you can see that there are already styles applied and why I'm showing you this right.

05:10.790 --> 05:15.060
Because remember when we had over here we can call the script.

05:15.060 --> 05:22.160
Remember these guys you buy accordion and you can see that I actually didn't spell it correctly accordion

05:22.740 --> 05:28.690
or like this or here here we have accordion content right.

05:28.730 --> 05:31.770
This is the best way how we can actually style it.

05:31.930 --> 05:37.190
And because we already have a preset classes now there's one thing here.

05:37.430 --> 05:42.080
So let's say that we're going to start styling them and I'm just going to say first things first putting

05:42.080 --> 05:43.980
20 pixels on it for the head.

05:44.630 --> 05:46.200
And exit and nothing happens.

05:46.490 --> 05:54.530
Well or if I do this important or you're doing this and then if we actually say it and you can see that

05:54.530 --> 06:01.430
I didn't spell important and now everything works right now the padding actually got bigger because

06:01.430 --> 06:05.930
we need to use or hear what is important and then we'll there's going to be a couple things and we're

06:05.930 --> 06:11.720
all going to do we're all going to say text a line and we're going to say Center then or here we're

06:11.720 --> 06:13.530
going to say a background.

06:13.680 --> 06:21.740
And again for the background we're going to say this is going to be Aztek F F C and have a 9 1 for we

06:21.870 --> 06:26.270
hear an exclamation more important like this.

06:26.270 --> 06:28.500
And again you can see now everything is working.

06:28.740 --> 06:36.380
Then we're going to have a color that 0 0 and then is going to be a and then we're going to have a 7

06:36.580 --> 06:43.630
see or hear one and this again exclamation got important like this.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.800
And I can see that text is working.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.070
Then we're going to have a text transform.

06:49.250 --> 06:53.260
This is going to be a capitalize on this.

06:53.270 --> 07:00.100
Then after that we're going to have a font size font size and Fonzo is going to be 25 pixels.

07:00.140 --> 07:06.460
Again we need to use important here now everything is working the font size.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.450
Maybe that's a little bit too drastic.

07:08.450 --> 07:11.250
Let's just go with 20 more here.

07:11.400 --> 07:16.820
Then after that we'll have a margin 5 pixels right and zero.

07:17.010 --> 07:21.770
And again we're going to use important like this.

07:22.110 --> 07:29.360
We're going to have the actual border and again we're going to have a let's say two pixels solid.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.960
And again we're going to use the color of blue.

07:32.210 --> 07:38.850
So hash tag 00 array and seven e one here.

07:38.870 --> 07:40.670
And again we're going to use a.

07:40.740 --> 07:43.830
Important here and this.

07:43.880 --> 07:51.210
And then we have a border radius for eight years and this is going to be 10 pixels here or here and

07:51.350 --> 07:57.260
we're going to say how important important right now I've got the board of ideas.

07:57.420 --> 08:01.130
Now the next thing that we would want is accordion content.

08:01.200 --> 08:06.240
And so this is going to be these guys right whatever we're clicking and it's actually appearing.

08:06.720 --> 08:15.480
So what we're going to do or here we're going to say a background in this tag be an hour here then we're

08:15.480 --> 08:23.820
going to say 5 C then we're going to have a to b seven to be an order so that after that we would want

08:23.910 --> 08:25.040
a padding.

08:25.200 --> 08:31.130
So I'm separating 20 pixels here and now again we need to use a.

08:31.130 --> 08:33.650
Important on this.

08:33.660 --> 08:35.260
Now we get the padding.

08:35.280 --> 08:39.800
Then we have a line height one point eight here.

08:39.990 --> 08:42.480
Then we have a color hashtag.

08:42.690 --> 08:46.040
And this is going to be EF 5 EF 3 or 5.

08:46.290 --> 08:51.630
And then we need border radios some more radios.

08:51.740 --> 08:57.170
And over here we're going to say 10 pixels on this right and you can see that in more than a radius

08:57.170 --> 08:58.050
what anyone.

08:58.100 --> 09:02.480
Right now when we have our styles here.

09:02.480 --> 09:02.950
Right.

09:03.040 --> 09:07.230
And now we can close it right now just remember these two classes right.

09:07.250 --> 09:11.140
This is the whole faster way how to actually styled them.

09:11.140 --> 09:11.450
All right.

09:11.450 --> 09:13.070
We can go back over here.

09:13.370 --> 09:14.440
We can refresh.

09:14.600 --> 09:21.910
And then let's look at one more thing we're here and how we can actually make this accordion slide let's

09:21.910 --> 09:22.940
say slower.

09:23.240 --> 09:28.700
So we're going to we're going to have a quorum note here we can just go back over here and we have a

09:28.700 --> 09:30.100
few options right.

09:30.150 --> 09:33.840
Can First of all just look at API documentation right.

09:34.130 --> 09:39.110
And you can see or here we have eight classes methods and events.

09:39.280 --> 09:39.840
Right.

09:39.890 --> 09:42.530
And what we need on here is that Sanomat.

09:42.830 --> 09:44.970
Well it says pretty simple right.

09:45.110 --> 09:47.820
We have a quorum and we have an image.

09:48.050 --> 09:53.670
So let's go back over here to our script and the script is going to be here.

09:54.080 --> 09:55.130
We have a calling.

09:55.310 --> 10:00.950
So what we need to do is have a curly braces right because we're creating an object.

10:00.950 --> 10:07.600
I'm going to say animate here and now again the number is actually going to be how many seconds.

10:07.610 --> 10:10.650
So let's say let's start with the really small one right.

10:10.670 --> 10:16.680
So four 4000 milliseconds which is as you can see this is going to be four seconds that's how long is

10:16.680 --> 10:17.710
is going I think.

10:17.730 --> 10:20.060
Obviously that's a little bit drastic.

10:20.270 --> 10:23.060
So let's go with like one second here like this.

10:23.100 --> 10:23.860
Right.

10:23.950 --> 10:31.660
And now I can see as I'm clicking now it's going to take one second and this is how we can make or hear

10:32.150 --> 10:35.700
this about section with an accordion.

10:35.960 --> 10:45.410
And like I said the chording is from Jake worry you why that is built on top of a jack worry.

10:45.530 --> 10:55.120
All right well we need to do is download the javascript CD and or file or see a size CVN or file file

10:55.650 --> 10:57.660
or here once we're done.

10:57.710 --> 11:00.630
I actually have two classes to work with.

11:00.970 --> 11:01.380
Right.

11:01.530 --> 11:02.420
Or here like this.

11:02.420 --> 11:09.030
Right so accordion head an accordion content and that's how we can make an accordion well here in this

11:09.410 --> 11:09.800
section.
