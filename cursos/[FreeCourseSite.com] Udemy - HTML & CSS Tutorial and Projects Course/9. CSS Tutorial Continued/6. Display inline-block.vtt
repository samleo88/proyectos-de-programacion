00:00.510 --> 00:03.930
At this point we know two values for the display.

00:03.930 --> 00:08.110
We know that there is going to be a display block as well as display in line.

00:08.130 --> 00:13.050
What about we cover the inline block just to see how this is gonna work.

00:13.050 --> 00:13.860
Now I'm gonna show you.

00:13.860 --> 00:18.960
This would link elements who are by default obviously in line but just please understand you can do

00:18.960 --> 00:20.340
this with any element.

00:20.340 --> 00:22.450
Basically you can set this to inline block.

00:22.680 --> 00:26.580
Now just like to show the characteristics of inline block.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.880
So let's start by simple Hello World.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.850
And again like I said we're all gonna be choosing some kind of in line element.

00:32.850 --> 00:35.550
In my case I just find the link to be fastest.

00:35.610 --> 00:36.200
That's right.

00:36.220 --> 00:39.890
And then there's gonna be value of link within the actual link.

00:40.030 --> 00:42.510
And let's copy and paste that I don't know four times.

00:42.530 --> 00:45.540
These are gonna be my heading one with these links.

00:45.630 --> 00:50.310
Now I was so like I said we would like to cover in line but we already know that there is gonna be an

00:50.310 --> 00:51.060
issue.

00:51.060 --> 00:57.630
If I'm gonna be styling the links and let's say font size is gonna be 60 pixels then let's maybe some

00:57.630 --> 01:00.540
background of red.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.240
This is gonna be a good option.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.910
Then also we have an option of adding the margin.

01:04.980 --> 01:08.810
Now the moment of we're gonna be adding the margin there is gonna be a kicker.

01:09.270 --> 01:12.390
If we're gonna add 10 pixels notice what's gonna happen.

01:12.450 --> 01:18.210
The margin is gonna be only applied again left and the right because for now the browser is ignoring

01:18.540 --> 01:23.190
because it's looking at it and saying Hey listen buddy you're in line home and I don't care whether

01:23.190 --> 01:28.260
you're adding the margin which in your case you're adding 10 pixels all around I'm just adding this

01:28.260 --> 01:30.920
left and right because you are displayed in line.

01:31.050 --> 01:36.990
So your question would be does that mean that each and every element if I won that margin does it have

01:36.990 --> 01:37.390
to be.

01:37.390 --> 01:42.740
BLOCK So let's say do I have to do like this display and block.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.550
Well the answer would be very simple no you don't have to.

01:45.780 --> 01:50.210
Because in your case you would be like I don't want this to be spreading all across.

01:50.250 --> 01:54.420
I just want them all in one line but then I would like to add still some margin.

01:54.420 --> 01:55.740
So how do we do that.

01:55.740 --> 02:00.930
Well I think I already answered by saying that we are going to be looking at inline block and we just

02:00.930 --> 02:02.010
write inline block.

02:02.190 --> 02:05.360
So what's happening within line block and let me come this out.

02:05.670 --> 02:08.520
And then you will see that right now we don't have the margin.

02:08.550 --> 02:09.780
Notice how they moved.

02:09.810 --> 02:14.580
And if I'm going to have inline block now more and if I'm going to have more margin just to show you

02:14.910 --> 02:19.380
then I obviously this is gonna be 30 pixels right now because the more margin we're going to add and

02:19.380 --> 02:23.270
let's say 600 or you know let's do 60.

02:23.370 --> 02:31.680
Now we're gonna have 60 pixels margin and if you would want your margin top to bottom margin to be respected

02:32.070 --> 02:32.380
you.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.710
And if you don't want it to be display block.

02:34.710 --> 02:38.920
So taking the full line you have an option of using the inline block.

02:39.060 --> 02:41.410
And again you can use this only element.

02:41.490 --> 02:42.870
I just showed you with the link.
