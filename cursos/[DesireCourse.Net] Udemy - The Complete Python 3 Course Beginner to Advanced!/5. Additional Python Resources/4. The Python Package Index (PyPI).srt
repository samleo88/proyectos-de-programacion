00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,390
Hey guys, so I wanted to discuss more
about Python packages and where you

2

00:00:06,390  -->  00:00:10,590
could find some if you're looking for
some packages. So let's go ahead and open

3

00:00:10,590  -->  00:00:17,250
up a browser here, and there's actually a
Python package index which is called PyPI,

4

00:00:17,250  -->  00:00:26,340
and if we come here there's the
ability to browse packages here, you can

5

00:00:26,340  -->  00:00:29,640
also see packages here as well.

6

00:00:30,269  -->  00:00:33,329
Now, if we go to browse packages,

7

00:00:33,329  -->  00:00:37,500
I mean you can also submit packages if
you build modules and you want to submit

8

00:00:37,500  -->  00:00:44,730
them to the Python package index which
allows them to be installed using pip. So,

9

00:00:44,730  -->  00:00:55,260
let's go ahead and narrow down some into, there we go we've got webgobbler

10

00:00:55,260  -->  00:01:02,010
here, let's go ahead and take a look at
this. If you click on a package, and I

11

00:01:02,010  -->  00:01:08,369
mean you can search packages too, but if
you get to a packages page it's going to

12

00:01:08,369  -->  00:01:14,850
give you a description here, gives you
some meta information about it, and

13

00:01:14,850  -->  00:01:23,340
basically all we have to do is grab this,
open up terminal here and "pip3 install

14

00:01:23,340  -->  00:01:36,270
webgobbler" Couldn't find a version so, no matching distribution.

15

00:01:36,270  -->  00:01:39,840
Alright, well, you can also go to the
download URL.

16

00:01:40,680  -->  00:01:45,149
Let's look for django because this is
something we're going to be getting into

17

00:01:45,149  -->  00:01:53,040
very soon as well. So if i just search
django on the python package

18

00:01:53,040  -->  00:01:59,159
index you'll see a bunch of modules here
as well, however we're just going to look

19

00:01:59,159  -->  00:02:05,280
for this one right here which is Django.
You can download directly from here if

20

00:02:05,280  -->  00:02:06,869
you'd like to,

21

00:02:06,869  -->  00:02:12,670
however we're not going to. It says it
requires bcrypt,

22

00:02:12,670  -->  00:02:22,060
argon2, and extra so let's go ahead and
jump into terminal here, and "pip3

23

00:02:22,060  -->  00:02:28,599
install django" see if that installs it, awesome.

24

00:02:28,599  -->  00:02:34,750
So we are installing django here, it should
pull in any additional packages that it

25

00:02:34,750  -->  00:02:39,700
requires, and then once we get it
installed we can just begin using

26

00:02:39,700  -->  00:02:44,380
it just like any other python package. So,
we're going to get into that in the next

27

00:02:44,380  -->  00:02:49,300
section, for right now that's all I
wanted to talk about regarding getting

28

00:02:49,300  -->  00:02:53,019
packages, and of course you know how to
use them.

29

00:02:53,019  -->  00:02:57,130
You can go to the homepage of the Python package as well if you want to get more

30

00:02:57,130  -->  00:03:02,470
information, and they usually have pretty
good documentation. So, for django we're

31

00:03:02,470  -->  00:03:05,680
just going to drop into the
documentation here and you can see

32

00:03:05,680  -->  00:03:09,580
tutorials, reference, guides, etc., and most
packages have a pretty good

33

00:03:09,580  -->  00:03:16,630
documentation, even if it's a github page
instead of the website, it it's usually

34

00:03:16,630  -->  00:03:17,859
pretty straightforward.
