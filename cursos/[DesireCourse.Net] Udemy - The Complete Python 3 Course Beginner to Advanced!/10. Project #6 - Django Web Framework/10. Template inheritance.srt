00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,829
Welcome back guys. Now this isn't

2

00:00:01,829  -->  00:00:05,040
entirely efficient in terms of our

3

00:00:05,040  -->  00:00:08,490
structure because if we use exactly what

4

00:00:08,490  -->  00:00:11,370
we've got here and we wanted a nav bar

5

00:00:11,370  -->  00:00:13,769
on every single page, we would have to copy and

6

00:00:13,769  -->  00:00:15,839
paste it on every single page, and so

7

00:00:15,839  -->  00:00:17,220
in this video we're going to talk about

8

00:00:17,220  -->  00:00:19,920
template inheritance and what that means.

9

00:00:19,920  -->  00:00:22,740
And so basically what we want is a main

10

00:00:22,740  -->  00:00:26,400
layout that includes a navbar and maybe

11

00:00:26,400  -->  00:00:27,840
a footer, you know things that are going

12

00:00:27,840  -->  00:00:30,090
to be on every page, and then we want to

13

00:00:30,090  -->  00:00:33,180
be able to load child templates in there.

14

00:00:33,180  -->  00:00:36,120
So, each page, each individual page

15

00:00:36,120  -->  00:00:38,160
that has different content, would be a

16

00:00:38,160  -->  00:00:41,040
different child template. And so in our

17

00:00:41,040  -->  00:00:44,309
templates right here we need to create a

18

00:00:44,309  -->  00:00:47,850
HTML file and we're going to call it

19

00:00:47,850  -->  00:00:50,039
base.HTML.

20

00:00:50,039  -->  00:00:53,760
This is going to be the base template of

21

00:00:53,760  -->  00:00:56,190
our entire site. So let's go ahead and

22

00:00:56,190  -->  00:00:58,379
give it a title. What I've called

23

00:00:58,379  -->  00:01:01,440
this project is my site and I'm going to follow suit

24

00:01:01,440  -->  00:01:03,930
and call it my site in there. Now here's an

25

00:01:03,930  -->  00:01:05,339
interesting thing we're actually just

26

00:01:05,339  -->  00:01:10,170
going to add a nav bar right here, so div

27

00:01:10,170  -->  00:01:20,310
class nav bar, default nav bar, static,

28

00:01:20,310  -->  00:01:27,689
top. We're going to go ahead and, actually

29

00:01:27,689  -->  00:01:29,490
I'm just going to copy a default

30

00:01:29,490  -->  00:01:33,509
bootstrap navbar. So, getbootstrap.com,

31

00:01:33,509  -->  00:01:41,280
go to getting started, and I

32

00:01:41,280  -->  00:01:43,590
actually want to copy the entire head,

33

00:01:43,590  -->  00:01:46,020
actually just these three meta tags

34

00:01:46,020  -->  00:01:49,079
right here, it's going to be important to

35

00:01:49,079  -->  00:01:55,820
copy these right there,

36

00:01:55,820  -->  00:01:58,790
and then the nav bar itself I'm just

37

00:01:58,790  -->  00:02:02,630
going to go to components, click navbar,

38

00:02:02,630  -->  00:02:08,000
and I'm going to copy just a simple navbar.

39

00:02:08,000  -->  00:02:09,440
Well, I'm going to copy this I guess

40

00:02:09,440  -->  00:02:11,060
then I will strip some things out that we

41

00:02:11,060  -->  00:02:17,600
don't need. So, copy that, stuff that right

42

00:02:17,600  -->  00:02:23,000
here, and now we don't...let me indent this

43

00:02:23,000  -->  00:02:24,140
a little better.

44

00:02:24,140  -->  00:02:32,540
Oh, so, bootstrap indents two spaces in

45

00:02:32,540  -->  00:02:35,720
their examples and my code generally

46

00:02:35,720  -->  00:02:39,530
indents four so that's going to be fun. Up

47

00:02:39,530  -->  00:02:41,780
here I'm going to type my site.

48

00:02:41,780  -->  00:02:45,680
This is the regular navbar so what I'm

49

00:02:45,680  -->  00:02:46,970
going to do is I'm just going to remove

50

00:02:46,970  -->  00:02:52,100
the search here at the top and the

51

00:02:52,100  -->  00:02:55,220
right navbar links, and I'm just going

52

00:02:55,220  -->  00:02:57,950
to make this say home,

53

00:02:57,950  -->  00:03:07,580
random post, and it's going to link to

54

00:03:07,580  -->  00:03:12,709
the homepage. This is going to link

55

00:03:12,709  -->  00:03:13,970
nowhere for now, we're going to create

56

00:03:13,970  -->  00:03:23,239
that. This is going to be my profile, and

57

00:03:23,239  -->  00:03:31,190
then settings.

58

00:03:31,190  -->  00:03:35,660
It's that indentation already getting to me.

59

00:03:35,660  -->  00:03:41,390
Alright, so, let me save this. This is

60

00:03:41,390  -->  00:03:46,100
going to be our base HTML but we haven't

61

00:03:46,100  -->  00:03:48,290
actually used it all yet, so what

62

00:03:48,290  -->  00:03:52,370
we need to do is we need to add in the

63

00:03:52,370  -->  00:03:55,280
main part of the body where we want the

64

00:03:55,280  -->  00:03:57,830
content to be dynamic we need to add a

65

00:03:57,830  -->  00:04:01,850
basically a block and we're going to go

66

00:04:01,850  -->  00:04:03,860
over this more in depth. First, what we need

67

00:04:03,860  -->  00:04:06,200
to do is add a div with an id of content,

68

00:04:06,200  -->  00:04:09,140
and once we've got that added we're

69

00:04:09,140  -->  00:04:12,170
going to go ahead and open tag and

70

00:04:12,170  -->  00:04:14,060
the tag is going to be block, and it's

71

00:04:14,060  -->  00:04:17,540
going to be called content. And then

72

00:04:17,540  -->  00:04:21,500
we're going to end block right there. Now

73

00:04:21,500  -->  00:04:22,910
we're not going to define anything in here

74

00:04:22,910  -->  00:04:25,040
just yet,

75

00:04:25,040  -->  00:04:26,990
what we're going to do this is going to

76

00:04:26,990  -->  00:04:29,840
be, this is going to allow us to define

77

00:04:29,840  -->  00:04:33,170
block content in a child template and it

78

00:04:33,170  -->  00:04:35,060
will replace everything that we put in

79

00:04:35,060  -->  00:04:38,419
here, and if the block content is not

80

00:04:38,419  -->  00:04:41,660
defined whatever we put right here is

81

00:04:41,660  -->  00:04:43,460
going to be shown. So what I want to do

82

00:04:43,460  -->  00:04:51,320
actually I want to show you that. This is a

83

00:04:51,320  -->  00:04:55,940
fallback text. Let's go ahead and save

84

00:04:55,940  -->  00:04:59,510
this. Now what we need to do is we need

85

00:04:59,510  -->  00:05:02,510
to, we need to create a template that

86

00:05:02,510  -->  00:05:04,640
inherits from this, and in here actually

87

00:05:04,640  -->  00:05:06,950
I've got to add the bootstrap stuff and

88

00:05:06,950  -->  00:05:08,480
our static stuff so let me go ahead and

89

00:05:08,480  -->  00:05:12,230
copy this and delete it, and in base

90

00:05:12,230  -->  00:05:16,130
right here we're going to be putting

91

00:05:16,130  -->  00:05:17,240
that stuff.

92

00:05:17,240  -->  00:05:21,169
Let's go ahead and indent properly and now

93

00:05:21,169  -->  00:05:23,810
in our index file here what we're going

94

00:05:23,810  -->  00:05:26,270
to do is at the very top here we're

95

00:05:26,270  -->  00:05:30,410
going to add a tag and it's going to say

96

00:05:30,410  -->  00:05:34,220
extends, and then whatever HTML file we

97

00:05:34,220  -->  00:05:36,860
want to extend from. So in this case its

98

00:05:36,860  -->  00:05:39,740
base.HTML.

99

00:05:39,740  -->  00:05:42,569
Now if I save this,

100

00:05:42,569  -->  00:05:48,330
and reload this, we go to our page and

101

00:05:48,330  -->  00:05:50,759
refresh, you'll see that now I've got

102

00:05:50,759  -->  00:05:54,779
that nav bar, but my content from the

103

00:05:54,779  -->  00:05:57,959
index page isn't shown there. The

104

00:05:57,959  -->  00:05:59,879
reason for that is very simple it's

105

00:05:59,879  -->  00:06:03,119
because it doesn't know what to do with

106

00:06:03,119  -->  00:06:04,679
any of this it loads the template and then

107

00:06:04,679  -->  00:06:06,179
it's like okay well I don't know what to

108

00:06:06,179  -->  00:06:07,469
do with all this so I'm just going to

109

00:06:07,469  -->  00:06:10,259
show the template, and that's where this

110

00:06:10,259  -->  00:06:12,659
block content comes in. If we define this

111

00:06:12,659  -->  00:06:15,869
in in here in the child template that

112

00:06:15,869  -->  00:06:18,330
that section, that block, is going to

113

00:06:18,330  -->  00:06:20,159
become whatever the child template is

114

00:06:20,159  -->  00:06:25,050
defined as. So let's go ahead and define

115

00:06:25,050  -->  00:06:29,009
block content right here, and then we're

116

00:06:29,009  -->  00:06:32,909
going to close it right here with an end

117

00:06:32,909  -->  00:06:36,180
block, I'm going to indent that. Now when I

118

00:06:36,180  -->  00:06:39,809
save it and hit refresh you'll see that

119

00:06:39,809  -->  00:06:43,860
our content from the index HTML page has

120

00:06:43,860  -->  00:06:46,589
overwritten the block content that's

121

00:06:46,589  -->  00:06:49,709
defined here, and so I guess think of it

122

00:06:49,709  -->  00:06:52,110
like if you define a block of code in

123

00:06:52,110  -->  00:06:54,930
here in the base layout and then you

124

00:06:54,930  -->  00:06:57,209
also define the same thing in a child

125

00:06:57,209  -->  00:06:59,490
template the child template will have a

126

00:06:59,490  -->  00:07:03,569
higher priority in essence. So what we're

127

00:07:03,569  -->  00:07:05,550
going to do is I'm going to go into the

128

00:07:05,550  -->  00:07:08,490
single post page and I'm going to do the

129

00:07:08,490  -->  00:07:13,379
same thing. So I'm going to type extends

130

00:07:13,379  -->  00:07:20,879
base.HTML. So if I refresh this and

131

00:07:20,879  -->  00:07:23,219
go to that page you'll see that I have

132

00:07:23,219  -->  00:07:27,180
the same navbar, and that's the point of

133

00:07:27,180  -->  00:07:29,669
using a base layout. Now you also see

134

00:07:29,669  -->  00:07:31,829
that the fallback text is back and

135

00:07:31,829  -->  00:07:34,439
that's because in here we haven't

136

00:07:34,439  -->  00:07:37,829
defined the block content. So, block

137

00:07:37,829  -->  00:07:45,719
content we need to end the block right

138

00:07:45,719  -->  00:07:49,619
there, then I'm going to indent this

139

00:07:49,619  -->  00:07:52,110
properly.

140

00:07:52,110  -->  00:07:56,940
Let's save it, rerun the application,

141

00:07:56,940  -->  00:07:59,970
refresh, and now you'll see that the

142

00:07:59,970  -->  00:08:03,450
entire site so far has a uniform ,

143

00:08:03,450  -->  00:08:10,080
and that's exactly what we wanted.

144

00:08:10,080  -->  00:08:14,520
So, you can also can also do this neat

145

00:08:14,520  -->  00:08:17,460
thing where you can set the title in the

146

00:08:17,460  -->  00:08:21,420
same way. So I'm going to define here

147

00:08:21,420  -->  00:08:28,560
block title, and it's just going to be

148

00:08:28,560  -->  00:08:30,270
the title. So in this case it's going to

149

00:08:30,270  -->  00:08:37,920
be the posts title, so post title. And

150

00:08:37,920  -->  00:08:40,470
then in base HTML that's not going to

151

00:08:40,470  -->  00:08:46,140
work yet because we haven't defined that

152

00:08:46,140  -->  00:08:50,100
as an over writable block of code, it's

153

00:08:50,100  -->  00:08:51,450
set statically here.

154

00:08:51,450  -->  00:08:52,860
So what we're going to do is we're going

155

00:08:52,860  -->  00:08:56,280
to open up the same block called title

156

00:08:56,280  -->  00:09:01,320
and we're going to end that here, and

157

00:09:01,320  -->  00:09:05,190
when we refresh now you'll see I need to

158

00:09:05,190  -->  00:09:11,100
restart that, oh I'm on the index page. When

159

00:09:11,100  -->  00:09:14,010
i go here you'll see that now the posts

160

00:09:14,010  -->  00:09:16,530
title is the name of that, and what we

161

00:09:16,530  -->  00:09:22,320
can do is on the post page we can print

162

00:09:22,320  -->  00:09:29,040
out my site and then the post title, so

163

00:09:29,040  -->  00:09:32,250
if we refresh you will now see it says my site,

164

00:09:32,250  -->  00:09:35,820
awesome post number four, and my first

165

00:09:35,820  -->  00:09:39,030
post. And so that's a basic introduction

166

00:09:39,030  -->  00:09:43,860
to blocks of code and what you can

167

00:09:43,860  -->  00:09:46,020
do with it. Now we're going to be going

168

00:09:46,020  -->  00:09:49,170
on more with this in the future,

169

00:09:49,170  -->  00:09:51,930
most likely, so this should give you guys

170

00:09:51,930  -->  00:09:54,450
enough capability right now to style

171

00:09:54,450  -->  00:09:56,190
this up, make it look like your own, I'm

172

00:09:56,190  -->  00:09:57,990
just going to do a bit of basic styling,

173

00:09:57,990  -->  00:09:59,820
and then in the next video we're going

174

00:09:59,820  -->  00:10:07,310
to get to user authentication.
