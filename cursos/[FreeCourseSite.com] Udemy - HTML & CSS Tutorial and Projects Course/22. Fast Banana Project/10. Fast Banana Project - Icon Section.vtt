WEBVTT

00:00.130 --> 00:04.890
And the next section that we want to build is over here are going to be in these icons.

00:04.890 --> 00:11.080
But mostly we're going to be actually concentrating more here on this effect on the slanted effect.

00:11.220 --> 00:16.520
So we're going to go back over here and not over here we're actually going to go back to our next issue

00:16.550 --> 00:21.250
here now see or hear or comment and of Hetter I'll get a place on here.

00:21.280 --> 00:29.850
This is going to be icon section here to select the whole line I'm going to copy this line here and

00:29.850 --> 00:36.000
then you will have a section and this is going to be icon section and we're using Section elements to

00:36.000 --> 00:37.550
actually group our code.

00:37.670 --> 00:40.120
So I'm going to say section on here.

00:40.210 --> 00:43.380
Don't have hash tag an idea or here right.

00:43.560 --> 00:48.840
So this is going to be icon section on this time.

00:48.960 --> 00:55.640
And now within the section we're actually going to have links that are going to be a font of my comments.

00:55.710 --> 01:02.220
So here I'm going to say this and I'm going to say this is going to be and I know we're here we're going

01:02.220 --> 01:06.990
to said that the guy is going to have a fire or here for like this.

01:07.030 --> 01:07.370
Right.

01:07.380 --> 01:12.800
And then what he would want to do is actually enclose this again in parentheses like this.

01:12.930 --> 01:16.730
Multiply by four press tab.

01:16.740 --> 01:17.930
Now you can see what we have.

01:17.930 --> 01:23.520
All right so we have for fun task my God you're going to say this is going to be home.

01:23.880 --> 01:27.310
Then the next one is going to be broke.

01:27.390 --> 01:34.270
Then after that we're going to have a coffee here and just in case you're wondering they're appearing

01:34.270 --> 01:34.620
over here.

01:34.670 --> 01:35.600
Right.

01:35.660 --> 01:41.730
And then over here we do want a fantastic anchor anchor over here.

01:42.070 --> 01:48.940
Now we can say this and we can actually go to Maine she says and stop this section and we're going to

01:48.940 --> 01:54.750
start first thing that we're going to have it is actually a comment.

01:55.060 --> 01:57.090
So this is going to be our new section.

01:57.120 --> 02:00.550
So we're going to have a comment I'm going to write a hashtags.

02:00.580 --> 02:02.110
Much of hashtags.

02:02.230 --> 02:04.540
I'm going to say I can.

02:04.700 --> 02:08.270
S. writes This is going to be another hashtag.

02:08.680 --> 02:16.790
Then after that we will do what we want is we would want a hash tag icon section icon section here.

02:17.050 --> 02:19.680
And then first of all going to say what would be the heart.

02:19.810 --> 02:20.120
Right.

02:20.170 --> 02:26.620
And I'm going to say the height is going to be 70 pixels on KNOW this and we cannot see anything for

02:26.620 --> 02:27.270
now.

02:27.340 --> 02:27.570
Right.

02:27.580 --> 02:29.790
Because it's all white background.

02:30.070 --> 02:32.920
So here we're going to say it's going to be background.

02:32.920 --> 02:42.650
Hash tag to be like this and then you have to and that it will have eight to a.

02:42.750 --> 02:43.400
All right.

02:43.400 --> 02:48.280
So this is going to be our black background color then we're going to say we're here.

02:48.320 --> 02:53.550
Very simple text align center to place them in the center.

02:53.570 --> 02:57.860
Then after that we would want a clip path polygon.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.230
And what is clip.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.420
So with Clearpath basically this is what we can do.

03:02.420 --> 03:04.090
We can create these shapes here.

03:04.130 --> 03:04.670
Right.

03:04.790 --> 03:09.260
And we're going to get quite a few training right so going to start with this section then you can see

03:09.260 --> 03:10.870
with each one of them right.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.560
We're also going to practice of how we can actually do this.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.920
All right well here we're going to have a clip.

03:17.060 --> 03:20.230
So we're going to clip and we're going to right path.

03:20.270 --> 03:25.750
And I'm just letting you know that in general we're going to have to use vendor prefixes.

03:25.850 --> 03:29.580
I just don't want to confuse the viewers right now.

03:29.570 --> 03:30.180
All right.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.570
I don't want him to have too much or hear of the cold.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.020
Right.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.090
So therefore we're not going to be using them in general.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.790
We'll have to use them or use.

03:37.810 --> 03:41.120
In the last one we're going to be creating the Starro here right.

03:41.300 --> 03:44.250
Then I'm going to show you what the vendor prefixes are.

03:44.540 --> 03:49.690
So here we're going to have a clip path and then here we're going to write polygon here on this.

03:49.850 --> 03:53.130
And then with the polygon we can create whatever shape we want.

03:53.210 --> 03:58.250
And the basic idea is that we are dealing with a four or here point.

03:58.320 --> 04:02.270
Right now we knew we couldn't have as many points as we want but let's start with four because that's

04:02.270 --> 04:04.140
going to make more sense.

04:04.150 --> 04:13.100
So here you can see that this starts with x 0 0 0 here at this point is going to be X hundred y is still

04:13.100 --> 04:13.930
going to be zero.

04:13.970 --> 04:14.540
Right.

04:14.840 --> 04:20.760
Then once we go down here this is going to be X still hundred and y is going to be 100.

04:21.020 --> 04:24.360
However here you can see it x is back to zero.

04:24.550 --> 04:27.850
Now here this is going to be 50 or 60.

04:27.850 --> 04:32.030
All right so let me show you how this works and again we're going to get a lot of practice so don't

04:32.030 --> 04:33.890
worry if you don't get it right away.

04:33.890 --> 04:39.930
So here first I'm going to start 00 this is going to be my point then or here I'm going to place a.

04:40.350 --> 04:41.850
And what I'm going to say we're here.

04:41.870 --> 04:44.060
This is going to be a next one.

04:44.060 --> 04:47.270
Next point is going to be 100 like this.

04:47.270 --> 04:49.220
Then again you are going to place a zero.

04:49.460 --> 04:52.950
So why all here in this case is still zero.

04:53.150 --> 04:54.940
Then we're going to start moving down.

04:55.220 --> 04:57.900
So this is going to be hundred percent.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.510
Hundred percent.

04:59.510 --> 04:59.810
Right.

04:59.810 --> 05:02.070
And you can see already how we created 3.

05:02.210 --> 05:04.440
So we created three points.

05:04.580 --> 05:05.930
The first point.

05:05.930 --> 05:06.940
Second point.

05:07.130 --> 05:08.570
And the third point right.

05:08.780 --> 05:12.420
And everything that's not included in these points is basically cut out.

05:12.530 --> 05:14.300
And now it's at the fourth point.

05:14.470 --> 05:18.530
So I'm going to say zero and this is going to be why 40 percent.

05:18.870 --> 05:19.870
That's right.

05:20.240 --> 05:25.130
So obviously we're here you can see from start changing why 50 60.

05:25.130 --> 05:29.350
Right it keeps going down 9 because hundred is all the way down here.

05:29.360 --> 05:29.590
Right.

05:29.590 --> 05:30.900
This would be hundred.

05:30.990 --> 05:32.640
What's going to leave it at 40.

05:32.660 --> 05:34.290
Now let's add a padding.

05:34.490 --> 05:38.620
So we're going to say we're here hunting and we're going to say 20 pixels.

05:38.870 --> 05:45.170
So this is going to be a top hand and then we'll have zero to the side 40 pixels in the bottom.

05:45.180 --> 05:46.970
And here again we're going to have zero.

05:47.190 --> 05:52.400
And now would you would want to do is first of all let's create more space and let's actually style

05:52.400 --> 05:53.880
these links.

05:53.880 --> 06:00.920
So here let's make it a lot of space and we're going to say we're here hash tag icon section we're going

06:00.920 --> 06:02.260
to say right.

06:02.300 --> 06:03.710
And what you would want.

06:03.710 --> 06:06.920
First of all we're going to say for these guys we're going to say this play in again we're going to

06:06.920 --> 06:08.700
say this plane line block.

06:08.910 --> 06:09.130
Right.

06:09.130 --> 06:15.380
Because that allows us to actually style them really nice and we're going to say panning five pixels

06:16.390 --> 06:21.420
10 pixels over here left and right right so top bottom five left and right.

06:21.470 --> 06:29.060
And then after that we're going to have margin top bottom zero left right 5 pixels just so they have

06:29.060 --> 06:31.720
a little bit of space so they push away from the edge.

06:32.090 --> 06:36.250
Then the next one is going to be font size 30 pixels.

06:36.370 --> 06:41.800
It's all going to make them bigger color and the car is going to be hashtag FFC.

06:41.930 --> 06:46.460
Radio color 9 1 4 9 1 for this.

06:46.670 --> 06:48.590
And then we'll have a border radio.

06:48.590 --> 06:51.290
So we're going to make them around more radios.

06:51.290 --> 06:54.400
This is going to be five pixels like this.

06:54.430 --> 06:54.950
Right.

06:55.100 --> 07:00.980
Not much but once we had the background going to see it actually right now we don't see it because the

07:00.980 --> 07:09.180
background transparent and here the background again we're going to use our GPA values to be 0 0 0.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.920
So this is going to be a black color.

07:11.120 --> 07:15.810
However we're all going out of here like this are going to say zero point eight.

07:16.060 --> 07:16.840
Know this.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.280
Right now I can see a darker black color.

07:20.660 --> 07:24.260
And then we're going to another transition right to organise a transition.

07:24.620 --> 07:31.100
And again we're going to first transform right now what we're saying is transition is going to be using

07:31.100 --> 07:33.010
a transformed property instead.

07:33.440 --> 07:39.850
Not a color or background Bugan to say we're here transform it with seconds ease or this.

07:39.910 --> 07:41.760
And also color.

07:42.070 --> 07:45.580
Two seconds is easier here.

07:45.670 --> 07:47.570
And then you're going to do a hovering role.

07:47.610 --> 07:48.330
Right.

07:48.400 --> 07:56.760
So I'm going to say I can section here and I'm going to say link however and what you will be hovering

07:56.760 --> 07:57.030
right.

07:57.030 --> 08:00.580
We're going to say transform and we're going to say translate.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.320
Why.

08:01.440 --> 08:05.320
So we're going to say translate more here and we're going to say why.

08:05.340 --> 08:07.400
So basically what I want to do is I'm hovering right.

08:07.410 --> 08:13.500
I want them to push up all up and I'm going to say negative 10 pixels right and then I'm also going

08:13.500 --> 08:19.380
to change the color I'm going to take color and is going to be hash tag D 9.

08:19.620 --> 08:24.270
Then we're going to have e 5 and then we'll have D6 on this.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.380
Right so the code is also going to change.

08:26.520 --> 08:31.730
So we can say this and we can might as well go have a look at the bigger screen.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.310
We're going to go back over here to refresh.

08:34.310 --> 08:36.240
Right so this is going to be the original one.

08:36.380 --> 08:38.630
Let's do the recording.

08:38.690 --> 08:46.060
It's refreshing to hear and see this is what we read as I'm hovering actually lifting up or here.

08:46.260 --> 08:51.210
And the caller is also changing right from the elbow to kind of cream ish color and we're here this

08:51.210 --> 08:53.500
is where we used a clear path.

08:53.670 --> 08:53.940
Right.

08:53.940 --> 08:58.180
And again we're going to have a more practice with that so don't worry about right.

08:58.260 --> 09:05.110
But basically we're using the points in order to actually cut out some section or here from this element.
