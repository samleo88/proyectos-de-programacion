00:00.260 --> 00:00.850
Okay.

00:00.870 --> 00:06.900
Our next subject is really really interesting and that is going to be the background how we can add

00:06.990 --> 00:09.990
background in our success as an image.

00:10.050 --> 00:14.010
Now in order to start working on this we we're going to have to get images.

00:14.010 --> 00:16.580
So I'd like to spend this video with this setup.

00:16.620 --> 00:18.450
Now you don't have to follow along.

00:18.660 --> 00:22.610
You can just go to resources and get everything that I'm gonna be doing this video.

00:22.710 --> 00:28.530
But I do want to show you again to repeat where we're getting images how we can save them and how we

00:28.530 --> 00:29.730
can crop them.

00:29.730 --> 00:35.640
Now before I do anything right now with images let me just delete my CSX service services says is going

00:35.640 --> 00:38.990
to be clear as well as in the next session email.

00:39.090 --> 00:44.260
We're going to get rid of all these divs that we did use in the previous video.

00:44.960 --> 00:45.960
Okay.

00:46.140 --> 00:48.100
Also we also can delete this guy.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.370
We don't need it.

00:49.470 --> 00:51.810
The photo is going to go bye bye.

00:51.810 --> 00:55.530
And then yeah let's go and look for images and you know what.

00:55.530 --> 00:56.680
I don't need the console.

00:56.730 --> 01:03.180
I don't think we will need it and let's open up the new tab again we can use pics eBay or pixels.

01:03.180 --> 01:05.180
I'm gonna go with pixels.

01:05.310 --> 01:10.590
What kind of image we can be looking for let's say we're gonna get this one this is kind of interesting.

01:10.590 --> 01:15.840
And again the way we'll do that we're gonna save images and then we're looking for where we're saving

01:15.840 --> 01:16.480
this.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.980
So in this case I'm gonna call this big image.

01:19.020 --> 01:23.630
Now you don't have to technically name it this way but there is a reasoning behind this.

01:23.640 --> 01:25.530
So again this is really up to you.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.710
I'm gonna say that this is going to be big.

01:27.840 --> 01:32.670
Then another image that I'm gonna be looking for is gonna be let's say this guy.

01:32.670 --> 01:38.200
And again we're going to do save human jazz and I'm going to call this one small again name it.

01:38.210 --> 01:39.240
How are you'd like.

01:39.260 --> 01:41.070
And I'm going to name it this way.

01:41.070 --> 01:42.730
And then what else we have.

01:42.750 --> 01:47.480
I guess we can maybe work with the actual building here.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.680
Let's say save em a jazz.

01:49.680 --> 01:55.260
Now the key here is going to be that I would like to create a folder and then I'm gonna save this image

01:55.260 --> 01:56.110
in the folder.

01:56.190 --> 02:00.240
So I'm going to call this first of all folder image that's going to be my name.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.630
And then first I would like to create a new folder.

02:02.670 --> 02:07.140
And again this is just to show you something how we would get the path here.

02:07.140 --> 02:10.470
Let's say AMG or images doesn't really matter.

02:10.470 --> 02:16.540
I'm going to create it and then I'm gonna save it within this folder hopefully you are successful.

02:16.540 --> 02:21.520
Now I'm going to head over to my folder and I would like to crop the small image.

02:21.520 --> 02:27.880
So the the one that's in the images folder as well as the big the big image can stay the same but the

02:27.880 --> 02:32.500
small one I would like to actually crop it and not in the Photoshop.

02:32.500 --> 02:38.680
I'm just going to do it the quick way in the actual Mac something to say within the tools I would like

02:38.680 --> 02:42.710
to adjust the size and let me just get something small.

02:43.090 --> 02:45.680
You know what I actually want a really really small.

02:45.760 --> 02:49.020
So I'm going to say a hundred by hundred.

02:49.060 --> 02:51.220
And this is gonna be very very small image.

02:51.240 --> 02:58.450
Let me save it and I think now we have all our setup so we can go ahead and start learning about background

02:58.450 --> 03:00.760
image property in the easy says.
