WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:03.610
So as you can see or here we have a button.

00:03.870 --> 00:09.340
And in our final project you can see that actually we can toggle or hear me.

00:09.540 --> 00:12.260
So now let's have a look how we can actually do this.

00:12.270 --> 00:15.530
So here we have this now single cover.

00:15.570 --> 00:17.890
Now we're going to create a little bit of space.

00:17.960 --> 00:24.030
I'm going to purposely do a little bit wrong because technically I should be applying more here these

00:24.030 --> 00:26.100
properties and values over here.

00:26.220 --> 00:29.940
However I just want you to see the distinction of what we're doing.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.530
And I'm just going to write again from the start here.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.100
So basically what I'm going to say on this.

00:36.110 --> 00:38.350
So first I would want to target Mavericks.

00:38.490 --> 00:41.670
And like I said we already have them over here.

00:41.670 --> 00:46.890
However I'm just going to create it from scratch just so you can see what we're actually doing.

00:47.220 --> 00:50.970
And the first things first what I would want I would want them to disappear off here.

00:51.170 --> 00:55.240
So first I'm going to say we're here right and I'm going to say zero.

00:55.380 --> 00:59.090
So we're going to save it over here and you can see that the links actually disappear.

00:59.440 --> 01:03.700
Or you can see that only in the background disappear you can see the links are still here.

01:03.930 --> 01:09.210
So what we're going to do is overflow and we're going to say that overflow is going to be hit.

01:09.510 --> 01:13.000
So once we saved now actually links generally disappear.

01:13.410 --> 01:19.940
Then again what we would want is a transition and from transition we're going to say two seconds.

01:19.950 --> 01:23.350
And again this would be a linear or something like this.

01:23.370 --> 01:28.470
So what I'm saying is I'm going to click the button they will going to show however they are going to

01:28.470 --> 01:30.240
show within two seconds.

01:30.290 --> 01:35.280
Now how are we going to make them actually show what we're actually going to do is we're going to show

01:35.640 --> 01:36.610
links class.

01:36.640 --> 01:41.880
This is going to be the new Lynx class or you're not going to say or hear height is going to be two

01:42.150 --> 01:44.120
hundred and sixty four.

01:44.130 --> 01:46.830
Now how do I know this is going to be two hundred and sixty four.

01:47.060 --> 01:53.700
So basically I used a Google Developer Tools and while I had ensouled before they were actually height

01:54.090 --> 02:01.570
zero here I just looked at what would be the actual height of my UL of my novels.

02:01.590 --> 02:04.580
So this is how I know this is going to be two hundred sixty pixels.

02:04.590 --> 02:12.060
Now you can have whatever size you want on here but I think the easiest one is actually go and check

02:12.420 --> 02:17.610
before you actually hide them and or here with a heightened Norful and check it out.

02:17.610 --> 02:22.470
What would be the height and then you can just write whatever height you would want and it's going to

02:22.470 --> 02:24.270
be very simple with the javascript.

02:24.270 --> 02:30.360
Only thing I'm going to do is I'm going to have a listener whenever I can I click the button I'm going

02:30.360 --> 02:34.720
to apply here this class to this link sorry.

02:34.980 --> 02:39.150
So let's go ahead or head to the script and we're going to say very simple.

02:39.150 --> 02:45.380
So first we're going to say document here then we know that we have a selector.

02:45.570 --> 02:50.910
So for the click query selector we have a nav on here between.

02:50.910 --> 02:55.610
So this was our actual class that we would want to target.

02:55.630 --> 02:58.240
Now we're going to say add that listener.

02:58.350 --> 03:02.490
Now this is going to be click event listener and I'm going to say that this is going to be a function

03:02.850 --> 03:04.430
show nav.

03:04.580 --> 03:09.060
Right now the only thing left to do is actually create the function.

03:09.060 --> 03:16.220
So I'm going to say here function show now and what we're going to write inside this function.

03:16.410 --> 03:22.330
We're going to say that first we will want to select the links and we would want to target the class.

03:22.350 --> 03:28.370
So we're going to we're going to have a document and we're going to have a query selector then within

03:28.370 --> 03:29.110
a query sort.

03:29.110 --> 03:31.250
And now we will want to select the links.

03:31.270 --> 03:34.150
So now I have to underscore some links.

03:34.180 --> 03:39.870
So now we're targeting the links then we'll have a class list here.

03:40.060 --> 03:45.300
And for the class list we're going to say toggle and what class you do on a dog.

03:45.770 --> 03:48.610
You want to toggle actual show links.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.450
So we're here to underscore.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.740
And this is going to be schillings.

03:52.740 --> 03:58.770
So once we say right now once I'm going to click the button you can see that my links are actually going

03:58.770 --> 04:04.950
to be appearing and they're going to be appearing over here because I added the shoaling squarest.

04:04.980 --> 04:11.080
Now this is actually a good time to see that actually I was wrong because you can see or hear that there's

04:11.100 --> 04:16.260
something wrong with a height where the height is not actually enough.

04:16.260 --> 04:22.790
So first let's go back to the main CSSA here and let's just get rid of this here then.

04:22.860 --> 04:29.430
So let me just hide a note here let me go back over here to my recording refresher here.

04:29.550 --> 04:34.890
And once I click the inspector here and then I'm going to find where's my element.

04:34.980 --> 04:40.190
And within the elements we're going to find that links and you can see that my actual size shouldn't

04:40.190 --> 04:45.640
be 288 because you can see that I have eight hundred fifty seven by 280.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.430
So I'm going to go back on here.

04:47.550 --> 04:49.000
This is going to change this route.

04:49.260 --> 04:56.130
First of all that uncommon does not say we're here and instead of 264 this is actually going to be to

04:56.300 --> 04:56.960
80.

04:57.210 --> 05:02.970
So once I actually press it right now now you can see that I'm going to go back on here and now I'm

05:02.970 --> 05:05.860
going to get my actual knife that I want it.

05:05.970 --> 05:10.200
And this is how we can create or hear this now.

05:10.440 --> 05:14.690
That is actually appearing and disappearing and we're here with a click.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.610
And the last thing that we would want actually do is we would want to set up on the bigger screen a

05:20.610 --> 05:25.440
different layout or so as you can see we're here as I'm changing the screen.

05:25.590 --> 05:27.280
Also my layout is changing.

05:27.300 --> 05:32.110
So here you go this would be actually a flex way out or real like this.

05:32.340 --> 05:38.040
Now we're going to change it to the actual row over here this would be a column.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.660
This is going to be our year.

05:40.050 --> 05:42.130
So let's go ahead and let's actually do that.
