WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:00.870
Next one up.

00:00.870 --> 00:05.760
We have an animation and probably since there are gonna be so similar.

00:05.760 --> 00:09.510
One of the first questions you're gonna have is gonna be like now okay.

00:09.510 --> 00:14.080
I know the transition but why you're showing this animation in my face right now.

00:14.190 --> 00:16.740
And the answer is actually very simple.

00:16.740 --> 00:20.550
You see what transition we always went from zero to 100.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.350
And that's gonna be obviously natural.

00:22.360 --> 00:24.760
Then look and example and yada yada yada.

00:24.870 --> 00:28.990
Just to give you a one quick short one sentence answer.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.950
Transition goes from zero to 100 always.

00:31.980 --> 00:38.190
We went from some kind of state that was here let's say on the left hand side and then our box moved

00:38.580 --> 00:40.910
to the right hand side and then it moved back.

00:40.920 --> 00:47.100
What's cool with animation we have way more option so we can have the point.

00:47.640 --> 00:51.070
So the animation is not going to go from zero to 100 all the time.

00:51.090 --> 00:57.240
Instead we can have the zero then let's say 1 percent and that that whatever percentages we would want

00:57.690 --> 01:02.970
and I know or you know already what I'm going to say is that we're going to have to look at the example

01:03.330 --> 01:05.880
because as always this is just gonna make way more sense.

01:06.690 --> 01:12.810
And again yes we will gonna be deleting CSX we will gonna be deleting interesting email because I do

01:12.810 --> 01:19.690
find it much more convenient or much more productive if we get used to working with HDMI on CSX.

01:19.860 --> 01:26.640
We could always let's say expand on the previous example but that I think robs you the actual opportunity

01:26.640 --> 01:28.320
to work on the muscle memory.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.630
Again it is my personal opinion.

01:30.810 --> 01:33.710
You might disagree with that but that's just the way it is.

01:33.830 --> 01:34.400
And here.

01:34.410 --> 01:37.200
Let's start by simply saying that there's going to be Dave.

01:37.200 --> 01:41.970
Now there's Dave is gonna have some kind of class and the class let's say is going to be transition

01:42.180 --> 01:47.270
just so we can see the difference and we can also maybe right transition name here.

01:47.430 --> 01:53.070
Maybe that's gonna make sense and then I would like to copy and paste it and now I would like to actually

01:53.070 --> 01:57.440
delete these values so I'm going to say that I'm gonna get rid of the transition.

01:57.930 --> 02:03.180
And here we're gonna write animation and you're already probably guessed that we're gonna be styling

02:03.180 --> 02:07.020
one with transition and the second one with animation.

02:07.020 --> 02:11.630
Now within the C assess let's just say that both those are going to look exactly the same.

02:11.640 --> 02:18.840
So again with there's gonna be two hundred pixels then we can deal the height and that's gonna be a

02:18.840 --> 02:20.130
hundred pixels.

02:20.130 --> 02:25.320
Also maybe let's add a little bit of margin all around just so they're not stacked one on top of each

02:25.320 --> 02:27.000
other as well as.

02:27.030 --> 02:28.880
And you know what I said this is not going to be class.

02:28.890 --> 02:33.430
This is gonna be Dave and then let's start with specific classes.

02:33.770 --> 02:42.230
So for transition I'm going to say and you know at last and then least add color and white hair and

02:42.240 --> 02:44.660
for transition what I would want for this.

02:45.030 --> 02:49.040
First of all let's add some background and let's say background is gonna be right.

02:49.340 --> 02:50.970
So this is gonna be my transition.

02:51.240 --> 02:54.940
And also I would like to say that there is gonna be some kind of change.

02:55.020 --> 02:56.760
So I'm gonna do this with transition.

02:57.060 --> 03:01.560
I'm going to say that there's been a transition now all the properties are going to be affected.

03:01.590 --> 03:07.650
It's gonna take two seconds and let's do a linear since we know that ease is gonna be the default one

03:07.650 --> 03:08.660
anyway.

03:08.820 --> 03:15.420
So far so good as well as I would like to work with my hovering because I was this transition should

03:15.420 --> 03:17.840
take place as I'm hovering.

03:17.840 --> 03:24.450
So I'm going to say as we transition as we're hovering what should happen now let's say background is

03:24.440 --> 03:25.530
going to turn yellow.

03:25.570 --> 03:33.120
Got nothing really original as well as I don't know we're going have work with a transformed property

03:33.720 --> 03:40.400
so I'm going to say transform is gonna be again translating x direction by let's say I don't know 100

03:40.470 --> 03:42.540
pixels so something like this.

03:42.540 --> 03:47.210
Now what happens as I'm hovering and then this is gonna move all the way to the right.

03:47.670 --> 03:52.980
And then as we're not hovering we're moving all the way to the left market so far so good.

03:53.370 --> 03:54.880
So what about the animation.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.540
Why this is so special.

03:56.550 --> 03:58.140
Well let's start working on that.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.360
So first of all the name wasn't animation.

04:01.410 --> 04:05.450
And now let's add maybe a background of I don't know blue.

04:05.580 --> 04:06.370
Something like this.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.220
So this is gonna have the background.

04:09.090 --> 04:12.290
And what else we would like to add our nitrogen.

04:12.720 --> 04:18.120
We can start working with animation maybe right away now for the animations we would need to set up

04:18.120 --> 04:21.260
key frames so the syntax would be something like this.

04:21.390 --> 04:26.370
We would need to write first of all had and this is gonna be very similar like we work with media queries

04:26.370 --> 04:28.410
remember we did something very similar.

04:28.410 --> 04:30.750
We had the ad and then media.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.300
Now in this case we were going to have to write the key frames.

04:33.300 --> 04:39.450
Now the naming matters here meaning if you were going to name this Grandpa Bob then you also need to

04:39.450 --> 04:42.850
reference it in the animation with the same name.

04:42.900 --> 04:48.560
Don't write something here different than the within the animation because this is not going to work.

04:48.630 --> 04:49.780
This is as simple as that.

04:50.050 --> 04:51.770
And I'm just gonna call my animation.

04:52.540 --> 04:57.220
And like I said the difference would be that we're not going from the state of zero to 100.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.860
We have multiple states in how do we access these data.

05:00.970 --> 05:05.310
We can use the percentage values so we can say what a zero percent.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.130
This is gonna have some kind of value.

05:07.560 --> 05:11.710
And first of all I'm just gonna say transform and let's translate it.

05:11.800 --> 05:17.160
I don't know 20 pixels x direction so I'm gonna say x direction 20 pixels.

05:17.220 --> 05:18.960
So this is gonna be my zero value.

05:19.180 --> 05:23.230
And then also I can have an option here of saying at 50 percent.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.110
This should be translated.

05:25.230 --> 05:26.470
Let's say a hundred pixel.

05:26.710 --> 05:30.250
So again we can copy and paste it and let's say hundred pixel.

05:30.340 --> 05:36.400
Now we're not limited to only having the one property here because as you can see we're working just

05:36.400 --> 05:37.420
with 21.

05:37.450 --> 05:39.400
We also can do let's say background.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.730
And again this could be as many properties as you would like.

05:42.730 --> 05:48.010
Now let me add the semicolon otherwise this is gonna throw an error and let's say background is gonna

05:48.010 --> 05:48.680
be red.

05:48.820 --> 05:52.640
So that 50 percent of the animation the background is gonna be red.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.360
Then we can add seventy five.

05:54.520 --> 05:59.670
And as always the reason why I'm using these round values is just to give you an idea.

05:59.710 --> 06:04.200
Please understand that you can use 1 to 3 percent one point five.

06:04.210 --> 06:09.160
It doesn't really matter but I'm not obviously going to cover all of them because it doesn't really

06:09.160 --> 06:14.760
make sense if we're gonna be going from zero to 100 by each and every information.

06:14.860 --> 06:15.280
You know what.

06:15.280 --> 06:20.110
We can in this case maybe grab these values already so we can say translate.

06:20.110 --> 06:23.650
And in this case I would want to more with hundred percent negative.

06:23.650 --> 06:29.830
So this is going to shift and left the yellow color is gonna be also the color for the background.

06:29.860 --> 06:34.800
And last but not least let's go forward one hundred where and you know what again I copy and paste it

06:34.810 --> 06:36.630
way too many times.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.230
And 400 I don't know what I would want.

06:39.230 --> 06:40.570
And let me decide.

06:40.570 --> 06:46.360
I'm going to go back again to 20 pixels I guess as well as I'm going to set this up with green.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.980
So that's my animation.

06:47.990 --> 06:51.700
Now at the moment as I'm refreshing the page nothing happens.

06:51.730 --> 06:52.870
The reason why nothing happens.

06:52.870 --> 06:57.250
Because we still need to set up the animation now for the animation again.

06:57.250 --> 07:03.470
Similarly how we had we transition we have the long way of writing this or we have the shorthand the

07:03.610 --> 07:09.160
first maybe let's start with the long one and then we're going to bounce back to a shorthand version.

07:09.310 --> 07:12.070
Now for the animation we're gonna say first of all animation name.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.130
So we always always need the animation name.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.580
And this is where the naming comes important.

07:17.590 --> 07:20.750
Again if you named it something else don't right.

07:20.770 --> 07:26.930
Grandpa Maria here or not Grandpa memory and Grandma Maria and let's say here I'm going to write and

07:26.930 --> 07:30.400
move since this is obviously the name of my animation.

07:30.430 --> 07:36.190
Now once we say it nothing happens because there's two more properties that we need for the animation.

07:36.190 --> 07:43.070
So not only we need duration so similarly like we had we had transformation or transition I'm sorry.

07:43.180 --> 07:44.830
Then we also need the count.

07:44.950 --> 07:48.670
So how many times this animation is going to take place.

07:48.850 --> 07:55.510
So we're going to be looking for animation and then we have the count property animation iteration count

07:56.230 --> 08:02.910
animation iteration and then we're looking for the count we have all kinds of options we can go one

08:02.920 --> 08:07.140
to wherever 12:00 and we're also going to have infinite value.

08:07.180 --> 08:09.690
Now we're going to look at the infinite value later on.

08:09.730 --> 08:11.450
Let me just go with you.

08:11.470 --> 08:12.850
So this is gonna run two times.

08:13.030 --> 08:19.720
Now notice what happens on right and say this animation is right now bouncing to the 50 percent and

08:19.720 --> 08:25.720
then 75 was negative 200 and then we're going back again to a zero.

08:25.840 --> 08:30.850
And again the animation is gonna take two times because we had the count here of two.

08:30.880 --> 08:34.420
Now you can already see that this gives you way more options.

08:34.420 --> 08:36.010
Transition was very simple.

08:36.100 --> 08:42.310
I go from one side and I go to another side and then the values are changing from 0 percent to 1/2 percent.

08:42.340 --> 08:46.780
With animation this gives you an unlimited amount of options.

08:46.780 --> 08:52.660
Now keep in mind though this 10 seconds is going to reflect this 50 percent.

08:52.960 --> 08:57.730
So if I'm going to write here let's say 20 seconds then my 50 percent there's gonna be already a 10

08:57.730 --> 08:59.500
seconds and so on and so forth.

08:59.860 --> 09:02.490
So these values are correlating to each other.

09:02.500 --> 09:07.870
So if we're going to write one second this 50 percent is gonna mean zero point five seconds and so on

09:07.870 --> 09:08.670
and so forth.

09:08.820 --> 09:09.230
Okay.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.330
So far so good.

09:10.330 --> 09:15.560
Now what about the shorthand because we see obviously the long way of writing now for the short guy.

09:15.570 --> 09:19.400
And again this is going to be very very similar to what we had with transitions.

09:19.570 --> 09:21.600
First there's gonna be the name and you know what.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.860
Let me go up here and select them all and just come in the mouth.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.850
The first one is going to be name.

09:27.850 --> 09:32.980
Then again we were looking for how long this is going to take place or duration and maybe in this case

09:32.980 --> 09:37.960
let's write five seconds as well as the last one is gonna be how many times we're going to run that

09:38.680 --> 09:44.590
animation and let's use the infinite value because that way you'll see that the animation is gonna be

09:44.590 --> 09:51.370
bouncing infinitely and whatever again we have the 50 percent 75 and the animation is just going to

09:51.370 --> 09:55.860
keep on repeating because we set up this value with the infinite bounds.

09:56.050 --> 09:59.640
And this is how we can work with animations in SPSS.
