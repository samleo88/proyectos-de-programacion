WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:03.640
Fresh after the nest and loud what else we have nothing.

00:03.720 --> 00:07.440
We have also the contact section within the contact section.

00:07.440 --> 00:12.480
We will then go back to our typical two column layout and on the left hand side there's gonna be some

00:12.480 --> 00:15.810
font of some icon with some kind of let's say title.

00:15.840 --> 00:22.020
Then this is gonna be some address of course an email as well as the phone as well as we're gonna be

00:22.020 --> 00:24.260
working here with the form.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.560
So on right hand side there's gonna be form.

00:26.600 --> 00:31.830
I think we don't need to waste any more time can just head over back to indexation amount since I was

00:31.840 --> 00:33.960
like we already know what we're going to be doing.

00:34.230 --> 00:37.300
And then let me find where is the end of the product.

00:37.580 --> 00:43.500
I'm going to make two comments or is there there's gonna be contact then we're gonna be saying end of

00:44.310 --> 00:50.070
contact on and off as well as what is gonna be within the contact.

00:50.070 --> 00:57.150
I don't know what start first by having a section with a class of contact and then within the section

00:57.150 --> 01:01.230
we're gonna have first of all the contact info as well as contact form.

01:01.620 --> 01:03.400
So this is gonna be a two column layout.

01:03.690 --> 01:06.580
So first let me start by having contact info.

01:06.930 --> 01:08.600
Just to have some kind of comment.

01:08.610 --> 01:12.390
This is gonna be my actual column as was right after that.

01:12.390 --> 01:19.580
Let's write article or take call with a class of contact info here.

01:19.640 --> 01:24.140
This is gonna be the case where I'm gonna copy and paste it and we're gonna change this one around.

01:24.380 --> 01:27.020
So this is not gonna be any more contact info.

01:27.020 --> 01:33.390
This is gonna be a contact form as well as the column name is gonna be contact form as well.

01:33.630 --> 01:38.570
Whatever we're gonna have within the contact info because obviously within the contact form we're gonna

01:38.570 --> 01:40.610
be working with our form.

01:40.610 --> 01:46.640
So it's kind of straightforward but within the contact info there's gonna be a few things.

01:46.820 --> 01:50.500
But you know what I also wanted to have the section center.

01:50.510 --> 01:58.450
I'm sorry I rushed a little bit so it's me right here first a div with the class of section then we're

01:58.460 --> 02:00.050
going to be looking for the center.

02:00.200 --> 02:05.780
So that's gonna be my class because I would want to use that layout thing as well as I would like to

02:05.780 --> 02:11.960
use the clear fixed class because I will gonna be floating them both not let me select both of them.

02:12.020 --> 02:17.380
So both articles and let me move up and now we're gonna be successfully within the center.

02:17.390 --> 02:18.720
So now I'm looking at it.

02:18.740 --> 02:21.020
I already have my section center.

02:21.050 --> 02:25.010
Like I said we're gonna go back to contact info on here is gonna be three things.

02:25.010 --> 02:30.530
So first we're gonna start again by contact info just so we can see where the one starts and the other

02:30.530 --> 02:38.410
one and copy paste it then let's say and off and what we would like to have within these comments.

02:38.570 --> 02:46.610
Well let's create first of all div with a class of contact item and within this div we're gonna have

02:46.610 --> 02:53.930
two things so we're gonna have the actual contact item and then we're gonna have the contact text within

02:53.930 --> 02:56.110
the actual contact text.

02:56.300 --> 02:59.750
There's gonna be title and the address.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.290
Okay.

03:00.320 --> 03:04.460
So there's gonna be a few things in here so let's just keep on moving.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.680
And this is just gonna make a little bit more sense once we get there.

03:08.090 --> 03:11.110
So let's say here they're all gonna be having three.

03:11.300 --> 03:17.770
Now this heading three is gonna have the class of contact title contact title.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.780
So this should be something like this.

03:19.960 --> 03:20.800
And you know what.

03:20.800 --> 03:26.500
What else we're gonna have here not just write that we would want our font awesome icon.

03:26.590 --> 03:36.250
So I'm gonna say airfares and now we're gonna be looking for location arrow location Keisha.

03:36.260 --> 03:39.410
And um I might know I'm not spelling this correctly.

03:39.410 --> 03:45.780
Location and we're saying in a row now we also like to add a class here.

03:45.790 --> 03:50.890
So even though our hour is going to be shown for this plan we're gonna add another class and that is

03:50.890 --> 03:54.160
gonna be contact icon.

03:54.410 --> 03:56.060
So that's going to be another thing.

03:56.180 --> 03:58.560
And you know what maybe we can change this around.

03:58.970 --> 04:01.300
So let's say within the contact info.

04:01.310 --> 04:04.790
This is not going to be contact info but item.

04:04.790 --> 04:09.010
So I think that way we're gonna make a little bit more sense of what we're doing.

04:09.050 --> 04:11.270
So each and every item is gonna have the comment.

04:11.390 --> 04:13.190
Then we had to hang three.

04:13.410 --> 04:17.650
Now right after this panel we're gonna write what is gonna be our title.

04:17.810 --> 04:23.340
So in our case this would be an address as well as a right after the first inning three.

04:23.360 --> 04:30.970
There is gonna be another one that's gonna have the contact text so class contact text.

04:31.060 --> 04:35.980
Uh here let's write the actual address five to three more.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.090
Fairfax.

04:38.090 --> 04:45.710
Fairfax Avenue then L.A. and then we're looking for California.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.930
0 9 0 0 4.

04:50.140 --> 04:54.780
A much more you can write Cincinnati doesn't really matter.

04:54.780 --> 04:56.230
That's gonna be my first contact.

04:56.650 --> 04:59.430
Now the contact that I'm in and of contact.

04:59.900 --> 05:05.830
What I would look to do right now is something where you'd have done before someone to copy and paste

05:05.830 --> 05:07.080
it two times.

05:07.100 --> 05:12.140
But in this case we're not only gonna be changing the icon we're also going to be working with the text.

05:12.740 --> 05:16.030
So first of all for the icon I wouldn't want the location.

05:16.160 --> 05:23.150
Instead we're gonna be going for our not location narrow what is gonna be their envelope.

05:23.210 --> 05:24.160
I think it was the them.

05:24.200 --> 05:24.570
All right.

05:24.980 --> 05:27.440
So email was the second one.

05:27.680 --> 05:32.590
So let's say in this case if a envelope.

05:32.620 --> 05:34.060
Let's say we're going to have.

05:34.060 --> 05:34.250
Yeah.

05:34.270 --> 05:35.470
So we're gonna have the envelope.

05:35.470 --> 05:37.260
This is not going to be the address.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.460
We were gonna write email.

05:39.910 --> 05:49.490
As per the title then let's write email at e mail dot com e mail dot com.

05:49.490 --> 05:52.890
And then we have the third one which is going to be the phone.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.940
So I believe we can do the phone.

05:55.940 --> 06:00.330
I'm pretty sure this is gonna be our Phantasm icon once I say ready.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.790
I'm having the phone so that's all good.

06:02.870 --> 06:04.980
Here I can change this too.

06:05.000 --> 06:12.570
Phone can just close it and here I can change the phone as well as the last one was gonna be the actual

06:12.570 --> 06:13.170
phone number.

06:13.830 --> 06:20.800
So let's say I don't know one two three plus plus plus plus Where are you once.

06:20.910 --> 06:21.430
Mm hmm.

06:21.430 --> 06:30.280
You cannot find a plus one two three four five six seven eight nine that's gonna be our successful phone

06:30.280 --> 06:31.240
number.

06:31.750 --> 06:36.000
That would be for the items and I say we're gonna do more styling once we get there.

06:36.190 --> 06:37.950
But now we can start working on a form.

06:38.380 --> 06:44.380
So within the form we all gonna be first of all creating the form element that we learn obviously already

06:44.380 --> 06:45.300
in normal.

06:45.610 --> 06:51.070
So I'm gonna say formal Now this is gonna give us the action as well as we're gonna have to work with

06:51.070 --> 06:51.630
the method.

06:52.150 --> 06:58.150
However normally since obviously we haven't talked it up to BHP or anything like that it doesn't really

06:58.150 --> 07:02.960
matter what we're doing but since we're gonna be using the form spray once we're gonna be done with

07:02.970 --> 07:07.120
styling and everything will gonna come back and we're gonna set up the action as well as the method

07:07.470 --> 07:13.170
for now we can just delete this and let's just say class and the class is gonna be formed group not

07:13.180 --> 07:19.220
so we don't really need to worry about it just add the class and we're good to go because as we're gonna

07:19.240 --> 07:23.670
start working with Formspring this is we're all gonna set up everything okay.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.760
And then here I would like to start working by the input.

07:26.830 --> 07:32.980
So first there's going to be input input type is gonna be text then the name is important because if

07:32.980 --> 07:38.770
you're gonna be using the form spree you need to make sure that that name is gonna be something we're

07:38.770 --> 07:44.560
all gonna be collecting the values if you're not using you can even old mid name but if you're gonna

07:44.560 --> 07:50.590
be working with the forestry with me then you need to make sure that this name does have some kind of

07:50.650 --> 07:56.400
value meaning if you're gonna write the name this is gonna show up in the forms if you're gonna write

07:56.400 --> 08:02.230
your orange and the orange is gonna show also I would like to have the plus place holder so the place

08:02.230 --> 08:08.160
holder is gonna be name and then I'm gonna have the class of form control.

08:08.320 --> 08:13.550
Now what I would like to do right now notice this is gonna be metal form is just copy and paste this

08:13.690 --> 08:15.580
and change these values around.

08:15.690 --> 08:22.570
Now the second one is gonna be type of email and email then the name is also gonna be email and this

08:22.570 --> 08:23.560
is the difference.

08:23.650 --> 08:26.320
So one is gonna be for a name and the second one is for name.

08:26.770 --> 08:32.200
So the value that's gonna be the name is obviously going to be reflecting to name and the e-mail one

08:32.200 --> 08:34.000
is gonna be for the e-mail.

08:34.150 --> 08:34.540
You know what.

08:34.540 --> 08:39.910
We can also do the email for their place holder so say email is going to be placeholder and then we

08:39.910 --> 08:40.990
have a text area.

08:41.170 --> 08:47.470
So let's right over here the text area element then hero and gonna be looking for a name so name is

08:47.470 --> 08:48.760
still important.

08:48.970 --> 08:57.380
When say something like message we don't care about the deers and the columns as well as the rows.

08:57.490 --> 08:57.860
You know what.

08:57.860 --> 09:00.850
Now Rose we do care about let's say five rows.

09:00.910 --> 09:08.500
So it's gonna be in rows and then we would like to add the and again the class name of form control

09:08.540 --> 09:11.080
because we would like to tell them all.

09:11.200 --> 09:18.090
And then you know what we also can have the place holder of message let's write placeholder message.

09:18.110 --> 09:22.640
Now this is gonna be a message within and last but not least within the form we would like to have the

09:22.640 --> 09:23.370
button.

09:23.540 --> 09:28.970
So let's write button and the button is gonna be submit so we can have the type of submit and that's

09:28.970 --> 09:33.590
the same thing as if would write the input with the value of submit and will work the same way.

09:33.980 --> 09:38.000
And here let's use the fact that we already have the buttons so we can say.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.700
Class class and we're gonna be looking for main PETN.

09:42.860 --> 09:48.530
Remember this is something we were we had a knowledge just types and this is gonna set up everything.

09:48.530 --> 09:51.060
Now it doesn't look very pretty right now.

09:51.080 --> 09:54.840
Again we need to go back to C assess and start signing.

09:55.070 --> 10:00.890
However we did a massive job because we added everything engaged the email so we should really feel

10:00.890 --> 10:02.110
good about ourselves.

10:02.270 --> 10:03.770
And let's head over to see Asus.
