WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:05.360
The next section you're going to be building is going to be all here our team section.

00:05.670 --> 00:10.270
And as you can see we're here we're not going to be using any kind of plug ins.

00:10.410 --> 00:10.710
Right.

00:10.710 --> 00:15.600
This is just going to be a H.T. amount and C section pretty much.

00:16.020 --> 00:17.700
So what are going to do well here.

00:17.720 --> 00:20.490
Where is this going to go back to next.

00:20.570 --> 00:25.760
You know we're here going to go to the numbers here.

00:26.250 --> 00:32.560
And then we're going to say this is going to be a moment Dean select the line.

00:32.610 --> 00:39.460
Copy and paste the line and are going to say and of the end of the.

00:39.680 --> 00:47.760
And we're going to have a section again ID the press table here and then we knew the title.

00:47.790 --> 00:49.870
So now let's scroll up again.

00:50.170 --> 00:52.650
Find where our closest title.

00:53.190 --> 00:54.670
It's going to be over here.

00:55.130 --> 00:56.810
And together with a comment.

00:57.150 --> 01:00.790
So we see where the actual title was ending.

01:00.780 --> 01:03.990
Copy this and we're going to go back over here.

01:04.010 --> 01:05.520
Where's the section.

01:05.520 --> 01:09.550
So we're going to copy and paste this and this is going to be current project.

01:09.640 --> 01:12.550
Now here we're going to change the icon.

01:12.690 --> 01:17.760
So this is going to be users users over here.

01:18.150 --> 01:23.510
Next one is not going to be current project or going to say this is going to be me it's going to say

01:23.520 --> 01:27.840
we're here to meet our team when we're like this.

01:28.170 --> 01:32.260
And then after that we would need to start building our team section.

01:32.280 --> 01:39.240
So what we're going to say or here is Dave we're going to give you an idea of team let's say center

01:39.890 --> 01:46.500
center or here then we're going to have a article to go on.

01:46.500 --> 01:51.050
This is going to be a team member team member here.

01:51.530 --> 01:57.420
And once we have a team member article now basically we need to create that card right.

01:57.800 --> 02:05.250
And for the card will can actually start very basic We're going to here image here and we're going to

02:05.250 --> 02:06.190
say that image.

02:06.210 --> 02:14.630
And once we press the tab now we want a images and let's say we're here let's go to a team Team One.

02:14.890 --> 02:15.260
Right.

02:15.330 --> 02:22.500
Because I have team one on here and on here we're going to say the image right now in order for us to

02:22.920 --> 02:24.760
have a easier work.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.440
Let's actually save this right away.

02:27.510 --> 02:31.930
Let's go to our main assess and just style that image.

02:32.310 --> 02:35.010
So it's not as annoying.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.040
All right so what I'm going to say here is that we're still going to start a team section and so this

02:41.040 --> 02:43.470
is going to be hashtags.

02:44.110 --> 02:49.970
Here are some more hashtags over here and then we right away going to style the image.

02:49.970 --> 02:58.070
And so I'm going to say a team and I'm going to say Remember no real image like this.

02:58.080 --> 03:05.580
All right so now I'm selecting the image in order here with is hundred pixels and when I say hundred

03:05.580 --> 03:07.860
pixels I mean hundred pixels.

03:08.220 --> 03:16.080
Then this is going to be a border radio is 50 percent more here and more here.

03:16.410 --> 03:20.270
Let's have a margin top negative 35.

03:20.430 --> 03:27.540
What what I'm going to do is I'm going to do that for now margin top and will do a negative 35.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.780
However let's just comment this up for now.

03:30.990 --> 03:31.260
All right.

03:31.260 --> 03:32.460
We don't need it right now.

03:32.460 --> 03:35.060
I want to show you actually at the end what happened.

03:35.070 --> 03:35.850
Right.

03:35.850 --> 03:39.640
So once we have this let's say it and let's go back to the next issue.

03:39.840 --> 03:40.200
All right.

03:40.200 --> 03:46.930
Otherwise it's going to look like like a lot of mess if we're having a very huge image and then we're

03:46.930 --> 03:48.460
placing some kind of text.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.250
It's not going to make much sense.

03:50.280 --> 03:54.990
So there's going to be heading to and we're going to say John.

03:55.440 --> 04:01.150
And here and here we actually need to go outside.

04:01.350 --> 04:10.050
Now we have had to have Jondo then we have a five here and I'm going to say developer and press time

04:10.050 --> 04:16.350
now we have had it fire and we're going to have a horizontal line here and then we're going to have

04:16.410 --> 04:24.390
a paragraph of let's say 20 words right press tab here press double here.

04:24.420 --> 04:28.390
So this is going to be our paragraph and then we'll get our footer.

04:28.680 --> 04:34.540
So still with an article we're going to say we're here and this is going to be Dave on here.

04:34.560 --> 04:43.230
Class and over here we're going to say member I don't know if we're really in this and we're going to

04:43.230 --> 04:53.180
have links with a font or so my guns so link or here and then I'm going to say we're here I F A and

04:53.690 --> 04:55.640
F on the way here like this.

04:55.660 --> 04:57.180
I pressed tab.

04:57.180 --> 04:59.300
Now this is going to be a dummy link.

04:59.460 --> 05:02.440
And how are you going to say Facebook and you know what.

05:02.460 --> 05:10.990
Let's do it like this let's just copy the line copy three times here and knowledge change Facebook then

05:11.560 --> 05:20.090
Instagram Instagram or here then the next one is going to be Twitter and then on here we're going to

05:20.090 --> 05:29.800
have a Google Plus Google Plus and that is it for the age e-mail because the only thing we need to do

05:29.800 --> 05:36.690
is with the middle wrap this article we're going to copy this guy over here already.

05:36.910 --> 05:42.790
And we need to copy this three times one two three and he'll just change a member.

05:43.110 --> 05:50.460
And so this is team number two team number three team number number four here.

05:50.530 --> 05:56.360
All right so now we have four of them will say this and we're going to go back to Menzi assess.

05:56.820 --> 06:01.090
And again we're going now we're going to start actually starting the actual section once we make the

06:01.090 --> 06:02.920
comment for our team.

06:02.920 --> 06:08.380
First things first we're going to have is a team and then we're going to say that this is going to have

06:08.450 --> 06:16.240
padding 40 pixels and zero so top bottom 40 and sides.

06:16.600 --> 06:25.540
And know your background we're going to have a hash tag B 5 C and or here and then we have to be seven

06:25.750 --> 06:26.890
or like this.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.310
And I can see what happens over here with this title.

06:30.330 --> 06:30.610
All right.

06:30.610 --> 06:32.900
So we actually need to work with this title.

06:33.190 --> 06:39.520
So we're all going to say hash tag team and we're going to say title and we're going to say sub adding

06:40.630 --> 06:43.210
sub adding or here like this.

06:43.210 --> 06:46.140
And with the subheading what we would want is a different color.

06:46.300 --> 06:54.010
So a hash tag 0 0 an A and then is going to be seven one more here.

06:54.010 --> 06:59.800
So this is going to be the blue one and the same thing we need to actually have for the border because

06:59.800 --> 07:02.650
we would want a world here right.

07:02.660 --> 07:04.900
So we're going to say oh here Dean.

07:05.250 --> 07:11.110
And we're going to take title and title text on this.

07:11.470 --> 07:17.890
And this is going to be border laughed and this is going to be three pixels solid.

07:18.090 --> 07:25.460
And let's get the color over here so we can just copy and paste this and or here are going to do it.

07:25.820 --> 07:30.840
So now we have a border and I would start working with a team member.

07:31.100 --> 07:35.190
So I'm going to say team member on this.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.860
So what do we want first.

07:36.910 --> 07:45.870
I want a text align center likeness than we would want a border and for the more of what we would want

07:45.870 --> 07:57.510
we would want one pixel solid or here we're going to say to E to A to a hill.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.460
And so this is going to be our border.

07:59.790 --> 08:09.780
Then after that would want a border radius border radius and that's going to be 20 pixels or you know

08:09.830 --> 08:19.400
like this then we're going to have a background hash tag EF 5 EF 3 and 5 know this EF 3 or 5.

08:19.490 --> 08:22.920
Then after that we would want a transition.

08:23.180 --> 08:26.710
This is going to be back around here.

08:26.990 --> 08:30.370
Two seconds is here like this.

08:30.380 --> 08:38.480
And then we'll have a margin margin maybe 70 pixels 0 or here and that's only top bottom that's what

08:38.480 --> 08:41.090
we care about the actual margin.

08:41.510 --> 08:45.630
And then after that you want to do is actually work with a team member.

08:45.760 --> 08:46.050
Right.

08:46.120 --> 08:56.060
So we're going to say here is that we would want a team member how we're member to say however and once

08:56.060 --> 08:57.940
we're hovering what should happen right.

08:57.970 --> 09:01.790
So the same background hashtags 0 0 no.

09:01.920 --> 09:06.350
A This is going to be seven easy one or this.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.570
All right so basically let's see what happens.

09:08.570 --> 09:09.210
Right.

09:09.230 --> 09:13.840
So as I'm hovering can all these things are going to be changing right.

09:13.840 --> 09:20.900
The background here is going to be changing then out of there once we have the hover let's do the image

09:21.200 --> 09:24.150
which we already did right here.

09:24.340 --> 09:25.370
Now we're here.

09:25.460 --> 09:29.660
Let's actually go back and now we can uncommon this.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.280
So here I can just uncommon this.

09:32.360 --> 09:35.000
Now I can see that my image is more here like.

09:35.130 --> 09:37.410
That's exactly how I want them right.

09:37.490 --> 09:39.290
So I close this one over here.

09:39.630 --> 09:42.690
And then the next one is going to be Team center.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.430
So this is going to be the parent for all of them.

09:45.740 --> 09:54.270
So I'm going to say team Santerre on here and then we're going to say Max with one here this is going

09:54.270 --> 10:03.170
to be 90 90 view with us here and then we're going to have a margin zero right.

10:03.250 --> 10:11.670
So now we're replacing it again in the middle and padding 40 pixels and zero more here like this.

10:11.670 --> 10:18.880
Now once we have this it's actually styled the team member adding two and having five in all.

10:18.930 --> 10:19.590
All right.

10:19.800 --> 10:27.510
So I'm going to say we're here team member and over here we're going to start with heading to and on

10:27.520 --> 10:33.360
here we're going to see a text transform and that's going to be capitalized.

10:33.510 --> 10:40.610
Then after that we're going to have a team member heading five so I'm going to say team member I know

10:40.780 --> 10:48.460
this is going to be hitting five and we're heading fibered would want is margin 10 pixels and zero.

10:48.660 --> 10:56.640
Right here's a bottom again and teks transform uppercase so text transform uppercase really does.

10:56.780 --> 11:08.830
And then we have a team member horizontal line so team member is on the line or here that's going to

11:08.830 --> 11:18.900
be with 70 percent are you doing this again and we're going to have a margin zero.

11:18.990 --> 11:20.220
All right.

11:20.260 --> 11:27.070
So again we're setting with we're here for this horizontal line but then we're actually placing it in

11:27.070 --> 11:33.400
the middle where the margin is zero and then we have a border and the border is going to be actually

11:34.060 --> 11:42.080
one pixels solid and that's going to be hashed f f c 9 1 4 or 0 like this.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.580
And that's going to be the more.

11:43.990 --> 11:50.440
And then one we would want to do is actually work with a footer or you know what let's do it paragraph

11:50.440 --> 11:57.630
first so we're going to second team member paragraph and we're here to say a line.

11:57.680 --> 11:58.530
Right.

11:58.710 --> 12:04.960
It's going to be too soon here and we're going to have a margin of 10 pixels like this.

12:04.970 --> 12:05.430
All right.

12:05.680 --> 12:14.440
So you can see or hear margin is all around then after that we have a team member for so team member

12:14.960 --> 12:21.450
and we're going to say for no reason and have a padding of 20 pixels.

12:21.740 --> 12:22.050
Right.

12:22.090 --> 12:26.800
So you can see for the whole what are we adding padding and or let's say zero.

12:26.800 --> 12:35.250
All right so top bottom then we'll have a background background over here and that's going to be a hash

12:35.250 --> 12:42.630
tag to e to an 8 to 8 2.

12:43.200 --> 12:48.980
So black color or here then we have one here you can see what happens right.

12:48.990 --> 12:53.040
So we have a radius for the actual team member.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.740
Right but over here these edges are square.

12:55.950 --> 13:03.170
So what we're going to say here is border bottom left so left radius and the right radius.

13:03.300 --> 13:06.000
And we're going to set it equal to 20 pixels.

13:06.210 --> 13:10.160
Right so basically we just need to make sure that they match.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.600
Right so this one left.

13:11.620 --> 13:14.800
This one is right on this.

13:14.850 --> 13:17.760
So we saved and now everything matches.

13:17.820 --> 13:21.120
Then after that we would want a display Flexo rere.

13:21.130 --> 13:21.380
Why.

13:21.510 --> 13:28.110
Because we want the icons to be lined up so we can say flex and then we're going to have a justified

13:28.110 --> 13:31.120
content space around this.

13:31.250 --> 13:31.710
Right.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.550
And now we get our space around.

13:34.790 --> 13:38.970
And now we need to actually start some more guns here.

13:39.210 --> 13:47.090
So we're going to say is team member or former for f a.

13:47.220 --> 13:52.300
And now what we would want to so font size 30 pixels.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.550
Then you are going to have a color.

13:54.650 --> 14:00.160
So it's going to be hash tag FFC and 9 1 4 0 here.

14:00.420 --> 14:02.620
And again this is going to be transition.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.890
Transition is going to be color.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.820
And two seconds is right.

14:07.860 --> 14:12.450
So what we want to do this transition is as we're hovering.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.010
The color is going to change.

14:14.100 --> 14:17.640
But again it's not going to happen instantly it's going to happen over time.

14:17.700 --> 14:21.770
So here we can just copy and paste this here.

14:21.870 --> 14:22.950
Copy paste this.

14:23.100 --> 14:25.940
And we're going to say Hulver.

14:25.990 --> 14:30.050
All right so now we have a team member footer going on here.

14:30.050 --> 14:33.380
We're going to say however hover over here.

14:33.650 --> 14:36.060
Now once we're hovering what would be the color.

14:36.420 --> 14:38.720
And here we need to write.

14:39.860 --> 14:44.590
And we're going to have hash tag 0 0 a 7.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.830
One more here.

14:47.060 --> 14:52.700
Right so we save this over here you can see what happens right as I'm hovering over.

14:52.700 --> 14:54.790
All right the image is actually changing.

14:54.890 --> 15:00.860
And now what we have left to do is again have a responsive layout.

15:01.000 --> 15:06.850
So we're going to do is we're just going to say that again this is going to be starting with the flex.

15:06.980 --> 15:13.430
So medium and here we're going to see a screen and we're going to see and we're all going to say men

15:14.390 --> 15:24.960
with with or here are going to be 576 megapixels and we're here and we're going to have is Team center.

15:24.960 --> 15:35.080
So Team center here and we're going to start with this play flex here and then we have just if I can't

15:35.180 --> 15:45.350
space between flex wrap sort of just I can't it's space space between here flex rap rap so flex rap

15:45.710 --> 15:51.230
and we're going to set it equal to rap and then we actually have a team member so we're going to say

15:51.260 --> 16:01.940
team member an order here we're going to have a flex 00 and this is going to be caulk.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.820
All right so we're going to use a quick function 50 percent minus 1.

16:08.190 --> 16:08.510
Right.

16:08.520 --> 16:12.880
So it's going to be the percent minus the gap that we have.

16:13.180 --> 16:16.430
So here this is the down final product.

16:16.760 --> 16:23.730
We go to recording and if we are fresh over here all right and if we go down this is going to be our

16:23.730 --> 16:26.790
numbers this is going to be our team right now.

16:26.870 --> 16:27.060
Right.

16:27.060 --> 16:31.970
So we feel fresh you can see that something didn't work out right.

16:32.070 --> 16:34.560
And I need to actually go and fix it.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.490
Where's the problem.

16:35.520 --> 16:36.080
Right.

16:36.400 --> 16:41.190
So here this was men with them this is going to be Team center.

16:41.470 --> 16:44.110
And we're hearing this is going to be team member.

16:44.790 --> 16:48.220
So let's go back over here and you can see that I'm missing parentheses.

16:48.690 --> 16:51.810
So this one over here and this should be fine.

16:52.050 --> 16:58.560
And now we have two of them 50 percent of what we would want to do is actually for a bigger screen.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.020
We're going to have a 25 percent.

17:01.020 --> 17:09.600
So again we're going to do it the same way nine and to can get this guy over here.

17:09.840 --> 17:17.460
Then team member let's do 25 more here we'll save this and you can see or hear that I have one more

17:17.540 --> 17:18.550
Princie.

17:18.660 --> 17:20.480
All right so say this.

17:20.600 --> 17:24.200
And now this should be for sure enough.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.320
Now we have four of them here now.

17:27.730 --> 17:28.910
Over here.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.390
We're going to do is we're going to have a grid.

17:31.660 --> 17:34.030
So we're here for the grid.

17:34.210 --> 17:39.490
We're going to have a forward slash a star.

17:39.970 --> 17:44.300
So we're going to be coming out another forward slash.

17:44.470 --> 17:47.680
Really going to write a media screen.

17:47.740 --> 17:49.170
And again we're going to have a.

17:49.220 --> 17:53.790
And I know we're going to have men with.

17:53.980 --> 17:56.950
And this is going to be 576 pixels.

17:57.120 --> 17:59.580
Then over here we're going to have a curly braces.

17:59.890 --> 18:07.510
So here we're going to say and this is going to be team center here and we're going to have a display

18:08.260 --> 18:09.300
grid.

18:09.700 --> 18:15.660
And this is going to be grid template columns or here.

18:15.670 --> 18:25.030
This is going to be one fraction one for action here and grid column gap because we want some gap in

18:25.030 --> 18:25.450
between.

18:25.450 --> 18:31.830
So we're going to say grid one and we're going to say gap and the gap is going to be 15 pixels or higher

18:31.840 --> 18:32.680
like this.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.470
Right now what do we want to do.

18:34.550 --> 18:36.420
We just want to copy and paste this.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.460
So I'm going to copy and paste this.

18:38.460 --> 18:42.230
I want to set it to equal to nine ninety two.

18:42.280 --> 18:47.320
So you are going to say 9 9 2 and over here get rid of grade.

18:47.470 --> 18:48.000
All right.

18:48.030 --> 18:52.010
And here this is going to be get rid of gap.

18:52.210 --> 19:02.500
Repeat for repeat here four and we're going to say one fraction one fraction or we save this one on

19:02.500 --> 19:04.970
here and this should also work.

19:04.990 --> 19:07.630
So we're going to go back on the air and fresh.

19:07.870 --> 19:09.640
I can see that our team is working.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.960
And once we over here shrink the screen right you can still see that we have our members on here and

19:16.960 --> 19:22.660
the next section then we need to build is actually going to be on here these progress bars.
