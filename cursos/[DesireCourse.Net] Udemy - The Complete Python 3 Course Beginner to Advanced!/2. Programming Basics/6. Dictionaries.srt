1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:05,460
So let's get into dictionaries and
that's gonna end the subseries I guess

2

00:00:05,460  -->  00:00:11,519
of types, this is going to be the last
type that we're going to talk about. So

3

00:00:11,519  -->  00:00:18,150
let's go ahead and open up a terminal
here and jump into Python. Now the

4

00:00:18,150  -->  00:00:23,400
previous video when we created a list we
used square brackets and we entered

5

00:00:23,400  -->  00:00:27,660
comma-separated values in there which
became our list,

6

00:00:28,500  -->  00:00:32,820
however in order to create a dictionary
we're going to open up sand close curly

7

00:00:32,820  -->  00:00:37,590
brackets here. Now in a previous video I
told you guys that we don't use curly

8

00:00:37,590  -->  00:00:41,700
brackets in Python and that was a lie,
and just so you know there's going to be

9

00:00:41,700  -->  00:00:48,030
a few of those throughout this course, so
keep your eyes open for them. What I meant to

10

00:00:48,030  -->  00:00:54,149
say, and just to clarify, you don't wrap code blocks in curly brackets like you do in

11

00:00:54,149  -->  00:01:00,030
PHP and JavaScript. Instead the only use
that Python has for curly brackets is to

12

00:01:00,030  -->  00:01:05,339
define a dictionary. So, rather than
entering comma-separated values we're

13

00:01:05,339  -->  00:01:09,689
going to enter comma for separated
values but each one of those is going to

14

00:01:09,689  -->  00:01:15,479
be a key and a value, so let's go ahead and create one. Let's create a person so the name is

15

00:01:15,479  -->  00:01:32,250
going to be {"name": "Nick", "age": is 27, "hobby": "code"} and that

16

00:01:32,250  -->  00:01:48,060
becomes our dictionary. Now, again, you can...you can access, I had tried to do that

17

00:01:48,060  -->  00:01:52,380
the JavaScript way here which you put a
dot and then the name of the key that

18

00:01:52,380  -->  00:01:53,340
you're looking for,

19

00:01:53,340  -->  00:01:58,530
in Python you do it like this kind of
like when you define an index number

20

00:01:58,530  -->  00:02:05,280
here. If you were to do this it wouldn't
be able to find it because it's not a

21

00:02:05,280  -->  00:02:10,979
list but with an array we would have
done that, in here we just type

22

00:02:11,600  -->  00:02:18,170
the name of the value we want. So name is going to print out "Nick" if we put in age

23

00:02:18,170  -->  00:02:26,030
that's going to print out "27" and if we
enter hobby that's going to print out

24

00:02:26,030  -->  00:02:31,640
"code" and so that's how to define a
dictionary and how to retrieve certain

25

00:02:31,640  -->  00:02:33,290
values from the dictionary.

26

00:02:33,290  -->  00:02:41,450
This is also going to become a very
useful later on once we get to, well once

27

00:02:41,450  -->  00:02:46,130
we get JSON itself because we are going
to do a video on JSON, but also once we

28

00:02:46,130  -->  00:02:52,670
start once we start working with a lot
of data some of it's, some

29

00:02:52,670  -->  00:02:56,510
of it we're going to explicitly convert
into JSON data just so we can parse it

30

00:02:56,510  -->  00:03:01,580
like this because this is one of the
easiest ways to parse data is using

31

00:03:01,580  -->  00:03:07,010
this form. So thanks for watching this
video and I hope you guys enjoyed it.

32

00:03:07,010  -->  00:03:11,930
This ends the sub section of types and
in the next video we're going to be

33

00:03:11,930  -->  00:03:13,010
learning about variables.
