WEBVTT

00:00.540 --> 00:01.470
Incredible.

00:01.470 --> 00:08.220
We finished another major milestone in CSX because now we know what is he says Box model.

00:08.280 --> 00:15.120
Well next property is very very interesting because it might confuse you a lot in the beginning and

00:15.120 --> 00:21.090
that is going to be the property of display was always let's start when I was an example and here I'm

00:21.090 --> 00:28.290
gonna get rid of eating one as was the paragraph so in the styles that we have in the CSX and also in

00:28.290 --> 00:32.680
the indexation IMO we're going to clean it up a little bit and different elements.

00:32.880 --> 00:37.590
So we're going to get rid of the heading ones and paragraphs and we're going to start very simply by

00:37.620 --> 00:38.680
having a div.

00:38.820 --> 00:44.910
So I'm going to say there's going to be a div now here in a day I'm gonna write that I am block element

00:45.370 --> 00:50.900
or just some kind of random text well random at the moment but you'll see why we're doing it.

00:51.480 --> 00:56.330
Then within a day let's add a class and let's say class is gonna be a block again.

00:56.340 --> 00:57.930
Doesn't really matter.

00:57.930 --> 01:00.300
You can call and call this class orange.

01:00.300 --> 01:02.080
It's not gonna change anything.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.870
Most important thing is what we're going to do in the CSA.

01:05.370 --> 01:10.000
So let's say there's going to be another heading and the heading is also gonna have the class another

01:10.020 --> 01:12.160
class again is going to be the same thing block.

01:12.450 --> 01:15.030
And also we're going to do the same thing with the text.

01:15.030 --> 01:20.940
So text is gonna be block element and sure enough now I have two of them.

01:20.940 --> 01:23.230
Now last but not least we're going to have paragraph.

01:23.230 --> 01:26.610
And don't worry we're not going to add any more block elements.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.100
But for now let's add a paragraph.

01:29.100 --> 01:36.550
Again we're going to do the same thing and block Elam and something like this and then let's add the

01:36.550 --> 01:37.760
same class.

01:37.840 --> 01:40.520
So let me copy and paste the class.

01:40.530 --> 01:45.530
Class is going to be right here with a paragraph and I have three elements so far so good.

01:45.640 --> 01:50.320
Then I would like to head over online somewhere some would say I would like to open up the new window

01:50.770 --> 01:56.560
and I'm gonna be going to pixels and those of you who are following the age normal part know that within

01:56.560 --> 01:59.530
the pixels Web site we can get nice images.

01:59.530 --> 02:05.200
So I'm just gonna search for some nice image and let's say here we're gonna call the smoothie and again

02:05.200 --> 02:08.790
you can look for kitten doesn't really matter as long as you get the image.

02:08.800 --> 02:13.510
I'm gonna go with this image and I'm going to say Save image now I'm going to look for my sister's folder

02:13.900 --> 02:18.950
and then within the a says folder not just call this photo again doesn't really matter.

02:18.970 --> 02:20.760
I just needed for example.

02:20.950 --> 02:23.500
Now I have my photo so far so good.

02:23.530 --> 02:27.590
So I was like Here photo J pic and now let's create three more elements.

02:27.790 --> 02:33.880
So there's gonna be the first one span and for this guy we're gonna say class in line and the only thing

02:33.880 --> 02:39.670
I would suggest is if you're adding different class names try to match them because then you're all

02:39.670 --> 02:42.670
going to see the actually better what's happening.

02:42.760 --> 02:48.130
Please don't name this orange than this one apple and then it's gonna be harder for you to see what

02:48.130 --> 02:48.980
we're doing.

02:49.060 --> 02:56.210
So I'm going to say I am in line element and that's going to be my span here and maybe we can just copy

02:56.210 --> 02:59.140
and paste this and change this around a little bit.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.030
You know what I actually didn't want too many.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.020
So I would like to have your image.

03:04.180 --> 03:11.110
Is gonna be my element and for the sauce I know that I look in this folder and in this folder I have

03:11.110 --> 03:13.760
photo and we're looking for J.

03:14.080 --> 03:20.870
Now what else I have I would also I'd like to add some with and let's say with there's gonna be 50 pixels

03:21.450 --> 03:22.280
so far so good.

03:22.280 --> 03:27.480
I have two spans and then I'm also looking here for the last one which is gonna be linked and you know

03:27.480 --> 03:34.600
what I actually didn't need to copy and pasted and that was a useless part of my actions.

03:34.780 --> 03:37.150
And let's do a trip attribute.

03:37.150 --> 03:41.730
Let's just say that link is not going to go anywhere it's gonna stay on this page and the class is also

03:41.730 --> 03:44.150
gonna be in line so far so good.

03:44.190 --> 03:53.330
Let's call this also I am in line element I know this was kind of a little bit annoying and long example

03:53.390 --> 03:59.590
HMO but hopefully you're gonna forgive me and we'll be able to work in a C assess and see why we're

03:59.600 --> 04:05.440
doing on this now let's head over to see assess and let's add some basic styles them.

04:05.730 --> 04:13.430
So for the black ones all of them who are black not just right and my background is gonna be let's say

04:13.430 --> 04:14.330
blue.

04:14.330 --> 04:20.340
Very very original and then color let's say is going to be white.

04:20.660 --> 04:26.750
Now for inline ones I would like to add something else I'm going to say in line element and here I'm

04:26.750 --> 04:34.260
gonna have the background of red and the color is gonna be white so I think this is gonna look sharp

04:34.260 --> 04:38.050
enough now as I'm looking on the right hand side.

04:38.110 --> 04:40.240
What are you noticing.

04:40.240 --> 04:45.760
So I have three elements here on top and I could have added way more that I just needed to prove my

04:45.760 --> 04:46.770
point.

04:46.900 --> 04:54.730
And what you're seeing is that they are looking at least differently than the ones in the bottom because

04:54.730 --> 05:00.880
what's happening is the for each in one of them even though we have more space we are starting a new

05:00.880 --> 05:08.200
line as well as each and every element is spanning from one side of the screen all the way to another

05:08.260 --> 05:15.150
side of the screen even though again we can change the screen size it's still going to do the same thing.

05:15.220 --> 05:17.560
Now the bottom ones are behaving a little differently.

05:18.370 --> 05:24.990
So they are not starting a new line as well as they only take up as much space as necessary.

05:25.800 --> 05:33.730
And what's happening is that in the CSX or in the interstate Mel what's happening is that there is elements

05:34.600 --> 05:40.300
that by default we're going to have display property in fact all elements have by default some kind

05:40.300 --> 05:41.860
of display property.

05:41.860 --> 05:49.240
Now property is going to be the same but the value might be different where for some elements the property

05:49.240 --> 05:52.480
is going to be block by default right away.

05:52.480 --> 05:57.190
And for some of them it is going to be in line and what's happening with the block is that with block

05:57.190 --> 06:02.800
level elements or block elements they will always going to start a new line and they're all going to

06:02.800 --> 06:04.690
take up the full with.

06:04.690 --> 06:11.200
Now for the inline ones they will not gonna start a new line and only going to take up as much space

06:11.290 --> 06:13.510
as content is necessary.

06:13.630 --> 06:19.840
Now that is important because you will going to use this a lot whenever you're styling it wherever you're

06:19.840 --> 06:22.790
dealing with some kind of layout whatever you're dealing with.

06:22.810 --> 06:30.160
I don't know how it looks it will gonna play a big role later on especially the more and more work you're

06:30.160 --> 06:32.120
gonna do with CSX.

06:32.250 --> 06:38.910
Now what's really nifty is that we can control this property so we're not just looking at it and saying

06:38.910 --> 06:43.890
okay there's nothing I can do I just have this plan and this is an inline element because what we can

06:43.890 --> 06:46.000
do is we can go here I said display.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.270
So that would be the name of the property and let's change that.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.990
Let's say that this is not gonna be in line anymore.

06:51.990 --> 06:57.720
And by the way notice if I'm going to write in line nothing is gonna change because by default all the

06:57.720 --> 07:03.730
inline elements already have this set and display in line but we can do this block.

07:04.060 --> 07:09.410
Now check this one out so I'm gonna say this play block and the one when I say read all of them start

07:09.420 --> 07:12.630
new line and all of them span from one side to another.

07:12.990 --> 07:18.150
Now we can do the same thing with the block once again I would first need to show you that if I'm gonna

07:18.150 --> 07:23.100
go here and if I'm going to save this play and we're going to call this block nothing is going to change

07:23.520 --> 07:27.420
because again by default they are block level elements or block elements.

07:27.510 --> 07:31.310
However we can do in line and now notice what's happening here.

07:31.380 --> 07:36.840
E in line and now we have them here as in line element.

07:36.840 --> 07:43.140
So now they're again taking only as much space as their content and they're not starting a new line

07:43.710 --> 07:48.390
and that's something that I mentioned in the very very beginning when I talked about Devens pan and

07:48.390 --> 07:55.170
I said I'm going to talk about this later but this is when we're covering the fact that all the elements

07:55.260 --> 08:03.480
are gonna have either inline or block set for display property and this will gonna matter as we actually

08:03.480 --> 08:06.720
start working with them and start styling them and see assess.
