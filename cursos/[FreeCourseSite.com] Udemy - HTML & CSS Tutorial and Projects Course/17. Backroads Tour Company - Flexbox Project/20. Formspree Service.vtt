WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:07.020
As a side note even though we are building a static site and fact we are not using any of the back and

00:07.020 --> 00:10.820
languages like no genius or BHP.

00:10.830 --> 00:14.860
In fact we can make this form submit a bill.

00:14.910 --> 00:16.260
Now what do I mean by that.

00:16.290 --> 00:23.430
Well if you remember our previous project the T station all the way in the bottom we also had a form

00:23.820 --> 00:27.280
and in fact we use the service by the name of Formspring.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.560
So the same thing we can do here.

00:29.640 --> 00:36.900
So let me open up just a form spray online of course it is a paid service but they also offer you a

00:36.900 --> 00:43.740
free option where if you would like to just start using it the only thing we need is to grab the action

00:44.250 --> 00:47.190
as well as the Post attribute.

00:47.250 --> 00:50.260
So method with the value of both.

00:50.280 --> 00:50.870
All right.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.640
So first of all let's copy that then let's head over back to our form and then like I said for the form

00:58.970 --> 01:00.150
notes and that.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.670
And then in this case you need to write your email.

01:03.680 --> 01:06.920
So essentially where we would like that form to be submitted.

01:07.370 --> 01:15.770
So in my case the email that I'm going to use is going to be and let me double check because I have

01:15.770 --> 01:19.310
one that I'm using for my courses all the time.

01:19.310 --> 01:21.030
Keep forgetting the name of it.

01:21.050 --> 01:24.180
So learn code tutorial AGM and outcome.

01:24.200 --> 01:30.680
Now of course again in your case you would use your email but I'm gonna go with learn called tutorial

01:31.400 --> 01:34.110
at AGM and dot com.

01:34.130 --> 01:34.610
All right.

01:34.610 --> 01:41.210
Again we have the attribute of method with the value of post and then one thing that is missing right

01:41.210 --> 01:43.340
now is the name attribute.

01:43.340 --> 01:48.340
So we're going to go with name attribute and let's just write the email.

01:48.350 --> 01:54.340
All right let's say email or we can say reply to it doesn't really matter.

01:54.350 --> 01:55.450
Well let's save that.

01:55.550 --> 02:00.710
And even as we're working on our local dev environment we can still do that.

02:01.070 --> 02:06.860
Now one thing that's going to happen is the first time we submitted we're gonna have to act effectively

02:06.860 --> 02:10.010
approve the fact that the forms are going to be submitted.

02:10.430 --> 02:11.750
So let's just test that out.

02:11.750 --> 02:20.450
Let's say I would like to sign up for deals and I'm gonna go with a random at a g mail dot com.

02:20.450 --> 02:26.650
Now if I'm going to try to submit it without in fact adding at my notice since we are using HDMI all

02:26.660 --> 02:30.350
five well nation is gonna complain.

02:30.380 --> 02:35.520
All right so let's write random G.M. dot com let's submit it.

02:35.900 --> 02:36.950
There you go.

02:36.980 --> 02:40.000
And like I said the first time we're going to submit that.

02:40.040 --> 02:40.870
Well you know what.

02:41.030 --> 02:45.260
Not just the first time in fact it's gonna ask whether you're a robot or not.

02:45.260 --> 02:48.730
In general so let's say yes let's check on that.

02:48.850 --> 02:56.000
And now it says while the form has been successfully submitted now in our end though we're going to

02:56.000 --> 02:58.520
have to in fact check it out.

02:58.520 --> 02:59.230
And you know what.

02:59.240 --> 03:03.480
Without any kind of verification I was able to actually do it.

03:03.500 --> 03:09.060
So in some cases the first time they were going to ask you they're going to say hey listen you need

03:09.060 --> 03:11.760
to make sure that you can submit the form.

03:11.760 --> 03:19.620
But in this case it right away just went and said yes the form has been submitted and this is what in

03:19.620 --> 03:23.220
fact they're writing now since we only have one input.

03:23.220 --> 03:25.170
That's the reason why it happens.

03:25.280 --> 03:25.650
OK.

03:25.710 --> 03:28.640
So let's just refresh the page.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.090
There you go.

03:30.150 --> 03:32.130
That's not what I wanted in fact.

03:32.280 --> 03:32.990
Let's move back.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.700
Now we're back in fact to our submission.

03:35.700 --> 03:38.390
Now again we're not using JavaScript nothing like that.

03:38.390 --> 03:41.850
So the values of course are not being deleted.

03:41.850 --> 03:47.010
So we're going to have to do it manually but this is again just to show you as a side note that if you

03:47.010 --> 03:54.630
really wanted to you could have your forms submitted just like we had previously already with our T

03:54.630 --> 03:56.100
station recording.

03:56.100 --> 04:02.120
Now maybe let's test that out also on a bigger screen size so let's do the same thing.

04:02.310 --> 04:06.280
I'm going to close the forms pretty as well as the station.

04:06.350 --> 04:08.190
No I don't need my identify as well.

04:08.760 --> 04:09.280
Yes.

04:09.300 --> 04:15.300
I'm not a robot that would be number one and then we can of course return to original site.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.240
And that should be it.

04:17.280 --> 04:18.870
This is going to be our form.

04:18.870 --> 04:24.240
And again I have a new form submission notice once we again submitted the form.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.170
There you go.

04:25.170 --> 04:35.170
It says the random gmail dot com and just double sure let's say random to random two at gmail dot com

04:36.240 --> 04:38.440
and let's try to submit it one more time.

04:38.490 --> 04:39.820
Then let's click on it.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.380
We're gonna have to say yes.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.910
We're not a robot.

04:43.110 --> 04:46.320
Then we can go back to original site and there you go.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.850
That is our original site.

04:47.850 --> 04:49.860
Everything has been cleared successfully.

04:50.220 --> 04:55.030
And again we have one more form submission and just like that.

04:55.560 --> 04:59.160
Online in this case the values at random to a GMO.

04:59.160 --> 05:04.800
Now of course if you would want some kind of messages instead meaning let's say that not only you would

05:04.800 --> 05:07.530
want to have the email there.

05:07.590 --> 05:09.970
Let's say the name and message and all that.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.400
You of course can do that.

05:11.420 --> 05:17.910
And if you're interested you can head over back to our T station project where in fact we set up that

05:17.910 --> 05:18.480
type of form.
