WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:05.620
Before we head over to see who says though why don't we also add a link.

00:05.650 --> 00:11.740
That's one thing that I forgot to mention were notice we do have the talks but all the way in the bottom

00:11.740 --> 00:16.060
we also have the link and in fact I did forget to add that.

00:16.090 --> 00:24.430
So first of all let me see Where is my tour center because in fact I would like to place it outside

00:24.430 --> 00:25.900
detox center.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.920
So we have a featured center.

00:28.990 --> 00:31.440
This is the day that I was talking about.

00:31.540 --> 00:42.660
But what I would like to do is in fact place it outside so let's write and off towards center like so.

00:42.840 --> 00:51.270
And then once we have that comment we're going to have a div with a class of towards link and then within

00:51.270 --> 00:53.750
this div we're going to place a link.

00:53.790 --> 00:57.480
Now it's going to be a dummy link meaning we're going to place a hash tag here.

00:57.930 --> 01:02.730
Let's have a class of Beatty and primary here.

01:02.760 --> 01:06.260
Remember man was the class that we already created before.

01:06.330 --> 01:08.740
Let's just write all thoughts now.

01:08.790 --> 01:15.570
The moment we save that all the way in the bottom we should have this link that has this class of BD

01:15.570 --> 01:16.680
and primary.

01:16.680 --> 01:22.870
Remember we set up this class already previously when we were in the About section.

01:22.920 --> 01:29.070
Once we have completed totally our Asia and now now we're going to head over back to the styles.

01:29.310 --> 01:32.640
And we already set up our featured class.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.880
That was our background so knowledge.

01:34.890 --> 01:38.760
Go line by line and start adding the rest of the styles.

01:38.760 --> 01:44.710
As far as our tours are concerned first of all I would like to add some kind of hover effect.

01:45.450 --> 01:48.460
Now first of all why don't we select the worse.

01:48.510 --> 01:54.810
So we're a card that is going to be each and every card that we're working with and let's maybe add

01:54.810 --> 01:56.770
margin bottom I'm off.

01:56.790 --> 02:03.030
I don't know for our teams just so we have some distance in between our cards and then like I said I

02:03.030 --> 02:07.090
would like to have some kind of box shadow.

02:07.320 --> 02:12.540
So let's write first of all box shadow property Mark shadow property.

02:12.540 --> 02:17.190
And now I'd like to use the values that we had all the way on the top.

02:17.190 --> 02:23.770
Remember when we set up our variables we had a light shadow as well as the dark shadow.

02:23.790 --> 02:29.370
So first of all for all my cards I would like to grab this light shadow value.

02:29.430 --> 02:34.970
And again we can use of course our block shadow generator or anything like that.

02:34.980 --> 02:38.000
But I just went with these particular values.

02:38.190 --> 02:47.340
So not say box shadow again where access var then hyphen hyphen and the value was like shadow the moment

02:47.340 --> 02:52.740
we do that notice even though we do have the white background as well as background within the card

02:52.740 --> 02:53.580
is white.

02:53.580 --> 02:55.450
Now we have this distinction.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.660
So now we can see where is our card.

02:58.170 --> 03:03.050
And also as I'm hovering over the card I would like to add a dark shadow.

03:03.070 --> 03:07.180
However I would want that transition to happen over time.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.890
So I'm gonna transition then for that.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.730
I already had my variable.

03:11.730 --> 03:19.790
So let's go with main transition like so and then let's say as we're hovering over these two or card.

03:20.130 --> 03:21.540
So let's write to work hard.

03:21.540 --> 03:25.220
However I would want that box shadow to change.

03:25.650 --> 03:28.380
I would want it to go to a dark shadow.

03:28.890 --> 03:30.390
So it's red box shadow.

03:31.110 --> 03:37.440
And then again var I find hyphen and the variable name is going to be dark shadow.

03:37.920 --> 03:43.900
So now as we're hovering over the card notice our shadow changes from light to dark.

03:44.070 --> 03:46.710
However it takes over time.

03:46.890 --> 03:49.730
And the reason why this is happening over time.

03:49.780 --> 03:56.510
Well because we are using our main transition variable and that would be step number one.

03:56.520 --> 04:01.860
Now let's start dealing with this date when I said I would like to place this date all the way here

04:01.890 --> 04:03.190
on the top.

04:03.660 --> 04:11.940
Now since I'm going to use a position absolute for that I would like to use my image container in fact

04:12.540 --> 04:14.130
as my parents container.

04:14.130 --> 04:19.680
So that way I can set that paragraph relative to my image container.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.330
Now remember what was the class name.

04:22.140 --> 04:27.850
Let's head over here and the class name was Tau hyphen image hyphen container.

04:27.870 --> 04:31.180
So first of all let's set this up as a position relative.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.300
So Tau hyphen image hyphen container.

04:35.580 --> 04:38.690
Well let's set this as position relative.

04:38.700 --> 04:40.350
That's step number one.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.950
And then we're going to work with toward date.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.170
And that is the class of course for our program.

04:46.290 --> 04:50.360
Like I said I would like to use position absolute.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.830
First of all we just take it out of the normal flow.

04:54.050 --> 04:59.250
Then let's place it on the top so top zero left zero.

04:59.280 --> 05:05.040
Step number one as you can see my paragraph is now sitting all the way on the left hand side.

05:05.070 --> 05:13.770
On the top then why don't we add some background and we're going to go with var primary color like so.

05:13.770 --> 05:15.470
OK looking good.

05:15.480 --> 05:22.290
Text transform capitalize text transform kept less and why don't we add a little bit of padding.

05:22.320 --> 05:25.310
Zero point twenty five our Ms.

05:25.770 --> 05:28.460
Top bottom zero point five.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.610
Our aims left and right.

05:30.640 --> 05:31.530
Right.

05:31.620 --> 05:38.520
Then once we're done with our awesome awesome paragraph we're gonna switch gears and we're gonna talk

05:38.640 --> 05:46.430
about the two word footer so I'm going to select the class of two or footer and I guess start very simply

05:46.430 --> 05:48.180
by adding some padding.

05:48.380 --> 05:57.360
So it's right padding one point to our hems to bottom and one point five our teams left and right now

05:57.510 --> 06:03.450
and is going to be my pairing then as far as your title is concerned.

06:03.560 --> 06:12.980
When we selected the word title and we're going to write text transform capitalized like so.

06:13.380 --> 06:20.000
So now our title is of course capitalized and then we're gonna start working with eight or country.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.840
So first of all let's add some kind of color to weight or country.

06:24.110 --> 06:27.950
So let's selected to work country.

06:27.980 --> 06:35.860
And we're gonna go for color var and primary color as well as I would like to capitalize it as well.

06:36.440 --> 06:46.350
So text transform we're gonna set it as capitalized and now once we have this added as a color.

06:46.490 --> 06:51.050
So once we have our primary color for our country.

06:51.050 --> 06:58.010
Well now I'd like to set up my two column layout because remember that is going to be our eventual goal

06:58.490 --> 07:00.810
where my country's sitting on the left hand side.

07:01.160 --> 07:07.040
And in fact the rest of the info is sitting all the way on the right hand side and we're using justified

07:07.040 --> 07:08.720
content space between.

07:08.720 --> 07:13.210
So they are in fact positioned as far as possible from each other.

07:13.220 --> 07:17.550
Now in order to do that remember we had to orient for that.

07:17.560 --> 07:22.670
It was our parent container for the country as well as for the rest of the info.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.860
Why don't we write display looks.

07:25.940 --> 07:33.080
So now they're sitting side by side like I said I would want to use justified content space between

07:33.950 --> 07:37.310
just so we have some distance in between them.

07:37.310 --> 07:44.000
But I also like to add a flex wrap just in case you know maybe there's not enough room at some certain

07:44.000 --> 07:49.010
screen size and then that way at least they are rapping to our next line.

07:49.580 --> 07:56.700
Now we also would like to do a little bit more styling for our paragraphs because remember we had a

07:56.700 --> 08:02.270
towards details div and then within this day we had these two paragraphs.

08:02.270 --> 08:10.220
So I would like to target them right now so let's write two more details and I'm going to target paragraphs

08:10.250 --> 08:12.010
within the two or details.

08:12.200 --> 08:19.880
And first of all I'm going to have a little less line height and I'm going to shoot for zero point two.

08:20.100 --> 08:28.670
Like so so now my line height is less text transform why don't we add capitalized and also let's change

08:28.670 --> 08:29.150
the color.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.910
So var main grey or you're not.

08:32.930 --> 08:35.910
Let's go with dark grey my apologies.

08:35.910 --> 08:37.870
I'm gonna go with da grey.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.580
That is of course my text.

08:39.730 --> 08:40.630
And last but not least.

08:40.630 --> 08:47.860
Why don't we add a little bit of letter spacing and letter spacing is gonna be zero point zero two or

08:47.910 --> 08:48.650
three.

08:48.810 --> 08:49.850
Like so.

08:50.050 --> 08:56.000
And last but not least we have the Center for detour country.

08:56.230 --> 09:00.950
So remember we already had the tour country selected correct.

09:00.970 --> 09:04.900
We added the color as well as we add a d text transform.

09:04.900 --> 09:11.950
Now I also like to in fact align it in the center because what I would like to do is just have all the

09:11.950 --> 09:12.270
time.

09:12.280 --> 09:13.650
This text in the center.

09:13.870 --> 09:19.870
Now it could obviously added here or I can just show you that of course we can selected separately as

09:19.870 --> 09:20.570
well.

09:20.620 --> 09:21.550
It's really up to you.

09:21.550 --> 09:23.640
I'm just going to select that separately.

09:23.650 --> 09:29.320
Just please remember that in general we could just add Aditi afforded to our country so let's select

09:29.410 --> 09:35.170
a country and let's just write a line self in the center.

09:35.190 --> 09:40.930
Again the reason why I'm doing that is if I'm going to add this particular property in here as we're

09:41.230 --> 09:42.980
initially working with our country.

09:43.130 --> 09:47.770
Well it's not going to make much sense correct because only later we're using display flux.

09:47.920 --> 09:54.040
So that's the reason when I'm doing the screen test I might repeat some particular selector with different

09:54.040 --> 10:00.500
property as well as the value I normally again you would place it here where all countries are initially

10:00.520 --> 10:04.630
but in this case I'm just going to add it as a one more selector.

10:04.630 --> 10:10.300
And lastly I would like to work with a tour link now that was my div.

10:10.350 --> 10:17.380
Remember here all the way the bottom and we're going to go with to our link text online and we're gonna

10:17.390 --> 10:19.040
sub this center now.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.860
So now we're just sitting in a center.

10:21.890 --> 10:27.650
And lastly we just need to come up with our column layout because what I would like to do is once we

10:27.650 --> 10:32.990
get to a certain screen size there's going to be a two column lamp and then we're going to have a three

10:32.990 --> 10:33.910
column land.

10:33.920 --> 10:39.610
Now of course since we have four items we are just going to wrap it to a next line.

10:39.740 --> 10:43.470
Now for that remember we needed to have the media queries.

10:43.670 --> 10:53.150
So let's go with media screen and mean with like so and we're going to shoot for seven hundred and sixty

10:53.150 --> 10:54.080
eight pixels.

10:54.170 --> 11:01.600
So starting from that particular screen size I'm going to target a class of featured center.

11:01.750 --> 11:04.000
And why don't we add some values here.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.480
So first of all I would want it to be displayed flex.

11:08.020 --> 11:12.460
Now we show you that on a bigger screen says there you go.

11:12.460 --> 11:17.330
That is going to be my display a flex course a bunch of things we still need to do.

11:17.500 --> 11:22.270
First of all what we would want is to work hard to be remember 50 percent.

11:22.330 --> 11:32.950
So flex can 0 0 calc function then 50 percent minus and then whatever margin you would like.

11:32.950 --> 11:34.580
So I'm gonna go with one Harry.

11:34.630 --> 11:39.620
I'm not going to switch back each and every time after property because we have already covered it.

11:39.700 --> 11:44.680
But what I would like to do is justify content space between.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.060
Again that is my preference.

11:46.060 --> 11:47.230
You can use different values.

11:47.230 --> 11:49.750
Let's say space around the space evenly.

11:49.750 --> 11:55.330
I just like my columns to be having as much space as possible.

11:55.330 --> 12:02.070
And then when we use flex wrap wrap because otherwise we're not going to start a new line.

12:02.190 --> 12:03.130
Let's do that.

12:03.160 --> 12:03.970
And there you go.

12:04.170 --> 12:05.610
And we have our two column layout.

12:06.060 --> 12:12.050
And lastly we would just want to have a three column layout once we get to a bigger screen size.

12:12.090 --> 12:14.350
Now what is going to be my screen size.

12:14.550 --> 12:19.630
I believe I'm going to shoot for eleven hundred and seventy.

12:20.010 --> 12:27.790
So make up and paste it and let me add the curly brace here the closing one so I don't have any errors.

12:27.840 --> 12:35.010
I'm going to grab a two card and as far as your card is concerned since I would like to have a three

12:35.010 --> 12:36.290
column layout.

12:36.510 --> 12:40.440
Well why don't we have a three three dot.

12:40.470 --> 12:42.160
3 3 3 3 3 something.

12:42.580 --> 12:43.650
Okay.

12:43.920 --> 12:44.460
Yep.

12:44.460 --> 12:45.000
There you go.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.830
We have our three column loud and that's how it's gonna look like.

12:49.830 --> 12:54.570
So once we get a bigger screen size we're gonna have a three count my out.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.040
So we start with one.

12:56.280 --> 12:59.430
Then we have a two column layout.

12:59.940 --> 13:01.810
And then of course we have three Commonwealth.

13:02.100 --> 13:08.070
Now I believe I messed that up here because I left it as 768.

13:08.340 --> 13:12.270
So I'll go with eleven hundred and seventy.

13:12.480 --> 13:18.660
And now we have to call them loud and then only once we get to the bigger screen size and of course

13:18.660 --> 13:24.960
we have our three column loud and we successfully completed our feature towards section.
