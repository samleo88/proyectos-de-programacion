WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:01.210
Beautiful.

00:01.260 --> 00:04.470
We have h the amount for one single card.

00:04.470 --> 00:07.030
Now let's head over back to Stiles.

00:07.030 --> 00:13.950
Well like I said I'm going to place it again in between the content or I'm sorry the contact and the

00:13.950 --> 00:14.970
product.

00:15.030 --> 00:21.060
So why I'm going to look for contact in this case as we can see it is in the product.

00:21.090 --> 00:30.530
So again let's add our comments where we have first of all these services services like so and then

00:30.530 --> 00:31.750
let's cut and pasted.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.040
That's right.

00:33.150 --> 00:34.440
Of services.

00:34.440 --> 00:35.260
All right.

00:35.270 --> 00:36.860
That's an awesome start.

00:36.920 --> 00:42.940
First why don't we add the background color because if we're checking our finished project you're gonna

00:42.980 --> 00:48.500
notice that we have the background of gray where for the contact we had obviously white.

00:48.830 --> 00:49.340
Okay.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.570
Now what is our color.

00:50.990 --> 00:56.540
Well if we scroll all the way up we can notice that we have a bunch of colors here.

00:56.600 --> 01:04.430
We have main dark as our systems variable and we have course main white main Gray primary color secondary

01:04.430 --> 01:05.190
color.

01:05.210 --> 01:08.600
In this case we're gonna set it as a main Gray.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.240
So this particular color.

01:10.280 --> 01:13.270
So in this case and I'll have to look into more for contact.

01:13.270 --> 01:20.470
I can just go for services and you're gonna notice how easy it is to navigate around our document Morsi

01:20.570 --> 01:21.770
as this document.

01:21.770 --> 01:26.970
And then let's start by in fact selecting the services section.

01:26.990 --> 01:33.590
Well let's add a background property so let's write background then we're gonna access our systems variable

01:34.040 --> 01:36.680
by the name of main Gray.

01:36.890 --> 01:44.600
We're not selected and I can clearly see that I do have my background right then I would like to right

01:44.600 --> 01:46.600
away work with my image.

01:46.670 --> 01:52.760
Now I'm gonna add a little bit more styles later on but first of all I would like to make it responsive

01:53.180 --> 01:59.240
because it is annoying the heck out of me the fact that it is so massive and the way we do that first

01:59.270 --> 02:01.820
all we select the class service.

02:01.850 --> 02:03.050
I am G.

02:03.470 --> 02:06.660
And then let's just say with is going to be hundred.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.240
So our image is going to be responsive.

02:09.410 --> 02:15.260
And then also we would want to get rid of this margin that is here in the bottom and the way we do that

02:15.320 --> 02:18.030
is by using this player of block all right.

02:18.170 --> 02:22.640
And you can clearly see how we got rid of the margin like I said there's going to be a little bit more

02:22.640 --> 02:30.140
styles I'm just gonna write more styles because right now I'd like to worry about the card itself.

02:30.590 --> 02:31.800
Then what we have.

02:31.820 --> 02:34.250
Well we have the title all the way on top.

02:34.340 --> 02:42.710
And remember for the title we had a class of services title so let's selected services title and then

02:42.740 --> 02:44.210
let's add some padding on top.

02:44.660 --> 02:52.830
So padding not bottom but padding top is going to be internal for our homes.

02:53.130 --> 02:55.400
And yes we have our padding.

02:55.610 --> 02:56.780
There you go.

02:56.900 --> 02:59.730
Then we have our services card.

02:59.750 --> 03:02.180
So one by one why do we start working on the card.

03:02.690 --> 03:09.110
And first thing that I would like to add is in fact this border not the border with is really up to

03:09.110 --> 03:10.080
you.

03:10.520 --> 03:13.590
You can go with five hour Ms you can go with one arm.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.050
It doesn't really matter.

03:15.140 --> 03:18.660
Now I'm gonna go with I believe zero point three.

03:18.740 --> 03:26.840
So let's me first select the card so service honored like so and then I'm gonna add Border of like I

03:26.840 --> 03:29.770
said zero point three are Ms solid.

03:29.870 --> 03:36.050
So I'd want my board to be solid and then I would want to use the primary color basically my green one.

03:36.110 --> 03:44.080
So essentially I'm gonna write a primary color like so and I should have my border awesome and everything

03:44.090 --> 03:45.840
works really really well.

03:45.950 --> 03:50.310
By the way I can check it out of course on my bigger browser window as well.

03:50.330 --> 03:56.230
Now I do have one card so that's the reason it looks like that but we are already getting there.

03:56.240 --> 04:03.470
Now next one up I would like to add a little bit of padding for on my card all around you see this line.

04:03.480 --> 04:09.230
That is my padding so I'm going to say for my card so service card first of all I had a border that

04:09.250 --> 04:16.610
I'm we're gonna add a little bit of padding all around zero point to our rhythms like so now I do have

04:16.610 --> 04:20.060
my padding but I'm also gonna use some border radius.

04:20.060 --> 04:25.070
So even though the rest of the project we didn't use any border radius in fact everything was sharp

04:25.520 --> 04:26.600
edges were sharp.

04:26.690 --> 04:29.570
In this case I would like to use a border radius.

04:29.570 --> 04:35.900
So we're going to write border radius for my hole card is going to be one RTM.

04:36.290 --> 04:37.130
OK.

04:37.310 --> 04:44.930
Now lastly I would also like to add a little bit of margin now because once the screen size is going

04:44.930 --> 04:46.360
to be extra small.

04:46.580 --> 04:51.090
So if I make my screen size extra small hold one some distance in between them.

04:51.170 --> 04:54.230
Later on when we're going to add more items.

04:54.670 --> 05:00.940
So that's the reason why I'm gonna say margin top bottom is going to be to Larry Ms.

05:01.130 --> 05:04.370
MIKE So I'm left and right is going to be zero.

05:04.380 --> 05:11.180
All right now that's my setup for the card later on if we're looking at a final project we noticed that

05:11.180 --> 05:13.340
we do have the box shadow.

05:13.790 --> 05:19.580
But since we also have the box shadow here for this guy for the icon first we're going to add it for

05:19.580 --> 05:23.650
the icon and then we're gonna come back and work with this card.

05:24.170 --> 05:31.840
So I'm going to write here comment bar shadow styling something like that because it's gonna make a

05:31.840 --> 05:34.200
little more sense once we get there.

05:34.300 --> 05:38.400
Now like I said more stars for the image and that's where we are right.

05:38.980 --> 05:41.380
And what do I mean by more styles.

05:41.380 --> 05:47.280
Well you notice one thing where I do have my nice ball radius for my card.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.570
But at the moment my image.

05:49.570 --> 05:52.090
Well it still has these sharp edges.

05:52.180 --> 05:52.920
Correct.

05:53.050 --> 05:55.950
And I can even zoom in just so I can see it clear.

05:55.990 --> 06:00.210
So what we would like to do is set up for the image also some border radius.

06:00.240 --> 06:05.200
However we need to be careful where I don't want to borrow a radius here on the bottom.

06:05.210 --> 06:12.610
I just want for the top right edge and top left edge and the property is following border and had to

06:12.610 --> 06:18.350
board that border and then we go for top and then we have left.

06:18.370 --> 06:19.150
All right.

06:19.180 --> 06:24.660
And then we have let's say left radius and I'm gonna set it for five harems.

06:25.120 --> 06:28.140
And then on left inside right away we have our ideas.

06:28.440 --> 06:35.340
Let's copy and paste that and let's just change this value not to the left but to a right.

06:35.810 --> 06:37.680
Now both of them have this border radius.

06:37.930 --> 06:40.630
And then we have our service info.

06:40.750 --> 06:43.450
So that's this guy over here in the bottom right.

06:43.450 --> 06:46.310
Right after the image we have our service info.

06:46.600 --> 06:52.450
So like I said that would be our second component essentially as we are creating this card.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.490
Now what are the styles for this guy.

06:54.610 --> 06:57.760
So let's start by service info.

06:57.910 --> 07:00.830
First of all and then let's add a background.

07:00.970 --> 07:03.970
My background is again really your choice.

07:03.970 --> 07:08.920
You could set this up white because notice your background is in fact Gray already.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.250
So it's going to stand out.

07:10.600 --> 07:14.380
But I'm gonna set it for my primary color.

07:14.380 --> 07:15.750
So let's write var.

07:15.830 --> 07:18.600
And for some reason I'm keep pressing the star.

07:18.610 --> 07:24.060
But I would like to get primary color like so and I do have it now.

07:24.370 --> 07:26.110
Everything works really well.

07:26.110 --> 07:29.810
Then why don't we add also a borer radius for the info.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.560
Because again we added for the image.

07:32.710 --> 07:37.590
But on the bottom we would want it for of course our service info.

07:38.110 --> 07:43.520
So in this case when I'm going to do just so we can save a little bit of time and copy and paste it

07:43.810 --> 07:50.550
and then instead of top let's select two cursors and delete it and let's red bottom and that's it.

07:50.560 --> 07:57.130
Now we're gonna have our margins or I'm sorry border radius is in the bottom then I would like to in

07:57.130 --> 07:58.730
fact center my text.

07:58.730 --> 08:03.160
So the line is gonna be center like.

08:03.170 --> 08:13.290
So then why don't we add a little bit of bigger font size so font size one point that we dream something

08:13.290 --> 08:14.650
like that.

08:14.650 --> 08:19.140
And then the letter spacing we have the variable remember.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.400
Again I'm going to scroll up quickly.

08:21.540 --> 08:24.290
We have the letter spacing variable.

08:24.550 --> 08:27.270
Yes that's variable for zero point five.

08:27.330 --> 08:34.470
Let's navigate back and let's keep on working just showing you where I'm getting these values var letter

08:34.470 --> 08:38.360
spacing let's set that one up.

08:38.470 --> 08:39.910
Also what I would like to do.

08:39.940 --> 08:47.040
Well I have the color correct so I could use a color color is going to be white.

08:47.160 --> 08:51.780
So var and we had the color variable of main word.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.760
And let's set it this way.

08:53.760 --> 09:01.560
And the last but not least we're gonna have a text transform and we're gonna set it as capitalized like

09:01.560 --> 09:02.220
this.

09:02.220 --> 09:09.630
Now lastly I'm gonna add a little bit of padding for my whole service and for so let's write here padding

09:10.080 --> 09:14.930
and I'm just gonna set a pattern for top bottom and no.

09:15.460 --> 09:16.750
Ah I'm sorry.

09:16.860 --> 09:17.190
Yeah.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.710
Top bottom but left and right is going to be zero.

09:19.800 --> 09:20.310
OK.

09:20.460 --> 09:24.100
Sorry I just got there confused a little bit where I was setting the pattern.

09:24.100 --> 09:30.060
Now technically if you want you can also set up the patterns here and also you can obviously change

09:30.060 --> 09:32.150
the letter spacing if you don't like.

09:32.420 --> 09:38.910
Now the reason why I'm adding heading this way is because in my setup I'm going to add later on of course

09:38.910 --> 09:45.440
this icon if you're not adding probably doesn't make sense to have that kind of padding such a big padding

09:45.440 --> 09:50.790
in the bottom or if you would want maybe to have the same padding in a bottom so you could also write

09:50.790 --> 09:52.880
something like this 2.5.

09:53.100 --> 09:53.530
Okay.

09:53.550 --> 09:54.800
That is your layout.

09:54.930 --> 09:57.720
Now my reasoning for that was very simple.

09:57.750 --> 10:00.260
Like I said I'm going to add my icon here on top.

10:00.610 --> 10:03.530
That's the reason why padding was left.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.110
Of course bigger on top here.

10:06.240 --> 10:10.230
Now please keep in mind there's multiple ways how we can create this.

10:10.590 --> 10:16.710
This is just one of the ways that I picked and it is no right or wrong answer in this case you could

10:16.710 --> 10:20.390
set up of course your icon here and just moved it up as well.

10:20.490 --> 10:21.830
That is also an option.

10:21.840 --> 10:27.570
Now I chose this particular way because I wanted to show you how in fact we can work with this service

10:27.660 --> 10:31.770
image container because there's gonna be cases where you would like to place something whether that's

10:31.770 --> 10:35.740
on top of image or in a central image and all like that.

10:36.090 --> 10:39.630
So the reason why I had this setup is that one.

10:39.630 --> 10:44.970
Now you could have obviously had the same result by doing stuff differently.

10:45.210 --> 10:51.750
There is no right or wrong answer as long as you get your job done or basically essentially if you get

10:51.750 --> 10:52.860
the layout that you'd want.

10:53.470 --> 10:58.410
And last thing that I would like to work in the service info is in fact the button.

10:58.410 --> 11:04.520
So this read more mutton where we're going to set up some styling for this particular button and go

11:04.540 --> 11:07.860
right serve his beat and I remember that was our class name.

11:08.370 --> 11:16.650
I would want to have it display in line block in line block just so I can have nicely of course my paintings

11:16.650 --> 11:17.640
and margins.

11:17.830 --> 11:20.080
Let's write background here in this case.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.420
Why don't we go for the White one.

11:22.810 --> 11:30.260
So our variable is main white like so then we have Texas Declaration of none.

11:30.260 --> 11:33.650
Now as far as this tax declaration goes why we're adding it.

11:34.010 --> 11:35.930
Well it's in fact very simple.

11:35.930 --> 11:39.110
Now in this case I didn't have it as a link correct.

11:39.110 --> 11:40.640
I just had it as a button.

11:40.640 --> 11:44.660
So of course you're looking at it and you're like well what was the point for tax decoration.

11:44.660 --> 11:49.270
Well let's imagine the scenario where this particular button in fact would be set up as a link.

11:49.640 --> 11:53.820
So that's the reason why we just get her off this default declaration that comes four legs.

11:53.910 --> 11:59.910
OK in this case it doesn't really do anything him because buttons don't have that now Tex transform

11:59.930 --> 12:07.430
why don't we set it up as capitalize capitalized like so then also why don't we add a little bit of

12:07.430 --> 12:10.330
padding zero point eight.

12:10.470 --> 12:13.810
Stop bottom to our aims left and right.

12:13.850 --> 12:22.690
Now that's my setup then color is going to be primary color which is going to be green Wah I'm color.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.120
And it should be green.

12:24.130 --> 12:24.670
Yep.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.960
I raise font weight.

12:27.080 --> 12:33.540
We're going to go with bold font two way and let's set it as bold.

12:33.650 --> 12:37.590
So then also let's add a little bit of.

12:38.130 --> 12:44.670
So in this case I'm going to say border zero point two are yams solid and I'm gonna go with the white

12:44.670 --> 12:51.820
one so far and then we had our variable of course by the value of main white.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.790
And in this case you're like wondering well what's the point.

12:54.790 --> 13:00.840
Well the way we have our setup is as I'm gonna be scrolling over of course the background is gonna change

13:01.500 --> 13:05.770
and the background is gonna be transparent and then we're gonna see our border now.

13:06.270 --> 13:09.450
So border and then what do we have after border.

13:09.450 --> 13:12.620
Well let's decide what we're gonna set it.

13:12.640 --> 13:18.730
Our border radius maybe more radius and we're gonna set it as zero point five.

13:18.730 --> 13:19.890
All right Ms.

13:19.890 --> 13:21.570
Cursor could be a pointer.

13:21.600 --> 13:25.190
So as I'm hovering over fact notice I have my cursor.

13:25.320 --> 13:30.870
And why don't we also add a little bit of margin at the top so margin up.

13:30.940 --> 13:37.570
And I'm going to go with one arms now a little bit bigger margin on the top as well as the transition

13:37.750 --> 13:41.960
because like I said as we're hovering over I would like to change the background color.

13:42.010 --> 13:44.770
That's the reason why we're going to set transition.

13:44.770 --> 13:49.210
And as far as transition we're going to go with main transition again.

13:49.440 --> 13:52.330
Once you assess variable we already said before.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.980
And then lastly why don't we add the hover effect.

13:55.120 --> 14:00.660
So let's write service n hover as we're hovering over this button.

14:00.760 --> 14:07.320
I would want to have the background of transparent so let's write the background transparent.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.500
That's number one.

14:08.530 --> 14:14.650
And second we're going to also change the color and both of these changes are going to happen.

14:14.800 --> 14:20.620
In fact over time so they're not going to happen instantly because we have this transition already set.

14:21.130 --> 14:26.650
So let's go with Main White is going to be in fact our color.

14:27.010 --> 14:33.160
So as I'm hovering over the button of course my background is changing and it's changing over time not

14:33.160 --> 14:34.010
instantly.

14:34.090 --> 14:37.020
And we have our initial card setup.

14:37.690 --> 14:43.670
Now next one up of course we're going to have to create more cards and then work on our floats.

14:43.790 --> 14:49.660
So where we have cards side by side and depending on the screen size whether we're going to have two

14:49.660 --> 14:54.220
cards in one row or in fact all three cards in the same row.
