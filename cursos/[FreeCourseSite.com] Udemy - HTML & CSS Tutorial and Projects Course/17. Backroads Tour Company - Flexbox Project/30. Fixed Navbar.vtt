00:00.810 --> 00:08.640
Once we have our toggling bar our next task is going to be setting up the nav bar fixed.

00:08.640 --> 00:13.250
So as we start scrolling I would like to make sure that my nav bar is fixed.

00:13.740 --> 00:19.390
So now as I was crawling up and down the page we have now bar sitting there on top of the page.

00:19.560 --> 00:23.940
But once in fact we get to a very top of the document.

00:23.970 --> 00:28.210
Well then our now bar is just sitting like it was normally sitting.

00:28.290 --> 00:32.310
And by the way the same is going to work also on a smaller screen size.

00:32.530 --> 00:34.860
So again that is my finished recording.

00:34.860 --> 00:40.650
Notice as we start scrolling you're going to notice that our number still stays there on the top.

00:40.700 --> 00:47.250
And I can still in fact toggle it right now the same like we had already previously.

00:47.250 --> 00:51.020
We're gonna have to start our journey in the style CSX assess.

00:51.030 --> 00:53.730
So here we have an and of Navarre.

00:53.790 --> 01:01.400
So why don't we add a common a fixed nav bar so similarly how we had with the toggling first we're gonna

01:01.410 --> 01:08.670
have to come up with the class and then dynamically we're going to added to our nav bar but of course

01:08.700 --> 01:14.840
before that we need to create class and then we're gonna test that out just by manually adding in our

01:14.840 --> 01:15.900
H2 AML.

01:15.930 --> 01:17.920
So first of all let's create that class.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.370
So let's say fixed and you know it.

01:20.370 --> 01:22.730
Just so you can see everything that is happening.

01:22.830 --> 01:28.900
Why don't we head over back to the nav bar and where we have the NAV and we have a class of No.

01:28.950 --> 01:36.540
Why don't we add our fixed class and then all the changes we're going to add for this particular component

01:36.860 --> 01:43.400
or meaning element I guess more class than we're gonna be able to see it right away here on a browser.

01:43.490 --> 01:47.520
And first of all I would want to set it position fixed.

01:47.520 --> 01:51.380
So I'm going to take it out of the normal flow and not just what happens.

01:51.420 --> 01:58.500
Well right away the moment we do that we have right now our element taken out of normal flow.

01:58.560 --> 02:04.740
So it's just sitting there so I can create keeps calling up and down and my number is of course sitting

02:04.740 --> 02:05.670
right there.

02:05.670 --> 02:12.060
Now what I would like to do though is right away set up the position for this particular element since

02:12.060 --> 02:14.320
it's not a more sitting in a normal flow.

02:14.400 --> 02:19.510
So I'm gonna go with Tab zero the left is going to be also zero.

02:19.560 --> 02:25.860
Like so then with why don't we go with hundred percent so our width is going to be hundred percent right

02:25.860 --> 02:26.320
now.

02:26.490 --> 02:33.180
And in this case we do need to add some kind of background correct because remember that was one of

02:33.180 --> 02:37.260
the things when we were setting up our Navarre.

02:37.260 --> 02:39.600
In fact we didn't use any background color.

02:39.750 --> 02:44.760
Remember all the way in the beginning I even showed you that if we would add some kind of background

02:45.090 --> 02:46.770
then we would be able to see.

02:46.860 --> 02:53.430
But now the problem is that since we have this nav bar background color like we already had previously

02:53.790 --> 03:00.450
while it's just showing when it's showing and when it's not showing well it's in fact behind the content

03:00.480 --> 03:01.690
that's sitting there.

03:02.070 --> 03:07.590
So what I would like to do right now is set in fact some kind of background something to say var and

03:07.590 --> 03:09.960
I'm going to go for the main gre.

03:10.050 --> 03:12.100
So essentially our NAV bar is there.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.020
We just cannot see it.

03:13.440 --> 03:19.320
And now sure enough once we have in fact this number then we can clearly see that our NAV bar sitting

03:19.320 --> 03:20.600
there OK.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.820
That is a awesome start.

03:22.920 --> 03:31.050
And now what I would like to do is in fact use this transition like so because as we are changing weather

03:31.110 --> 03:35.610
now Boris fixed or not I would like to happen smoothly.

03:35.640 --> 03:40.500
So again we're going to do it using JavaScript functionality but since I would like to happen smoothly

03:40.820 --> 03:42.920
we're going to add this transition properly.

03:42.990 --> 03:47.170
So let's say transition property is going to be equal to var.

03:47.170 --> 03:50.460
And again we have our main transition.

03:50.470 --> 03:53.870
Then why don't we also add a box shadow.

03:53.940 --> 03:57.800
So I would like to add a little bit of box shadow around my napper.

03:57.810 --> 04:03.330
So as was crawling in fact let's say once we get to this grey section I would want it to stand out.

04:03.690 --> 04:06.290
So remember we had a real variable for that.

04:06.480 --> 04:13.430
So we can say box shadow and we're going to go with light shadow white shadow like so.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.560
So now we have all that shadow.

04:15.750 --> 04:21.900
And then of course also as we're scrolling there's gonna be cases where you notice we do have our image

04:21.900 --> 04:27.840
and all that but are in fact Navarre is behind them all right.

04:28.170 --> 04:30.630
We cannot see them in few cases.

04:30.660 --> 04:34.170
So in order to fix that we're going to set up a z index of 1.

04:34.260 --> 04:39.420
So that case as we're calling up and down it is in fact sitting up front.

04:39.750 --> 04:45.810
And once we're done setting up our sources again the javascript functionality is going to be somewhat

04:45.810 --> 04:47.030
straightforward.

04:47.100 --> 04:55.110
We're currently we're adding this position are fixed with of course our class of fixed manually where

04:55.110 --> 05:01.230
we just head over to Navarre when we add the class a fixed if I'm going to remove class of fixed horse

05:01.240 --> 05:06.940
my number is just going to be sitting on the top and nothing is going to happen as we start scrolling

05:06.940 --> 05:07.870
up and down.

05:07.870 --> 05:14.800
If again we're gonna have this class fixed then of course are now bar is gonna be fixed to a top of

05:14.800 --> 05:15.550
the page.

05:15.700 --> 05:20.140
So as we scrolling up and down Navarre is just sitting there on top.

05:20.530 --> 05:26.330
So similarly how we had we a toggle we're gonna have to do this dynamically.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.920
So again let's head over back to Algiers.

05:28.990 --> 05:35.050
Now again I'm gonna select my comments and I'm gonna change them around because at this point it is

05:35.050 --> 05:42.090
not going to be nav toggle is going to be nav fixed RAM so fixed nap.

05:42.190 --> 05:46.010
Now let's start by selecting our NAV bar.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.880
Now we can do it in multiple ways.

05:48.940 --> 05:55.750
We can target in fact the I.D. so we could set up some kind of I.D. here but in this case just to change

05:55.750 --> 05:56.950
things around.

05:56.950 --> 06:02.380
I'm in fact going to use this classroom number just to show that of course once we use javascript we're

06:02.380 --> 06:08.160
not limited to selecting only the elements with I.D. can also select classes.

06:08.260 --> 06:14.770
So let's write first of all cost and I'm going to call this a nav bar is equal to a document.

06:14.830 --> 06:22.150
Now instead of using get element by D we're going gonna use a query selector and we're going to select

06:22.270 --> 06:23.630
our NAV bar.

06:23.710 --> 06:24.350
All right.

06:24.460 --> 06:28.950
Now again just to double check whether everything works correctly.

06:28.990 --> 06:31.960
Why don't we console log our NAV bar.

06:32.620 --> 06:35.770
And if we have the number then we can proceed.

06:36.190 --> 06:41.950
If not we need to double check whether all our setup is working color correctly.

06:42.100 --> 06:47.250
Now once we have console logged number and we can clearly see that we are selecting it.

06:47.470 --> 06:54.700
Now we would want to add the event listener to our window to our pretty much a browser window.

06:54.700 --> 06:58.880
So as we start calling I would like to set up a event listener for that.

06:59.050 --> 07:01.100
So let's write again a window.

07:01.180 --> 07:03.050
Now in this case I'm going to order right away.

07:03.070 --> 07:06.330
Add event listener and again same two things.

07:06.340 --> 07:12.700
First of all we need to say what event are really going to be listening to and then the second one is

07:12.700 --> 07:14.550
going to be a callback function.

07:14.620 --> 07:23.680
Once that particular event is being called and what we can do right now is console log something really

07:23.680 --> 07:28.340
interesting with the value of page y offset.

07:28.480 --> 07:36.940
So I can say window then page y offset and you're going to notice that as we start scrolling we're gonna

07:36.970 --> 07:41.780
have some values and that essentially tells us well how much we have scrolled down.

07:42.150 --> 07:42.510
Okay.

07:42.640 --> 07:46.560
So as I keep on scrolling notice that my values are also changing.

07:46.600 --> 07:50.860
So now let's say I'm like thousand something pixels scrawled from the top.

07:51.010 --> 07:56.840
And we're gonna use this value in fact to add that class or NAV bar dynamically.

07:56.920 --> 08:04.210
Now first of all we need to understand that I would like to add this class once I have reached 62 pixels.

08:04.390 --> 08:06.230
Now why 62 pixels.

08:06.280 --> 08:14.080
Because again if I look at my dev tools I can notice that my now bar has a with that is of course changing.

08:14.080 --> 08:19.000
So the first value is gonna change depending on the screen size but the second one the height is not

08:19.000 --> 08:19.990
going to change.

08:20.110 --> 08:24.590
In fact it is going to stay exactly sixty two pixels.

08:24.940 --> 08:29.980
And now I can say something like this where I'm going to use the if an L statement and we're going to

08:29.980 --> 08:41.110
say window then again page y offset if it is bigger than 62 pixels then I would like to add a class

08:41.110 --> 08:42.440
list of fixed.

08:42.460 --> 08:44.520
Now y class fixed.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.520
Remember we created this class.

08:46.540 --> 08:46.780
Right.

08:47.200 --> 08:53.950
So what I would like to do is say Navarre since we just selected the nav bar and then we're gonna have

08:53.980 --> 08:55.300
a class list again.

08:55.330 --> 08:56.170
That is our property.

08:56.530 --> 09:03.330
And then we have a method of ADD let's just say we would like to have this class fixed and one that

09:03.330 --> 09:04.610
we just created.

09:04.620 --> 09:12.570
However if it is not bigger than 62 well then I would like to remove that glass somewhere else you can

09:12.570 --> 09:17.100
just say Navarre class list remove.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.820
And we're again moving the class of.

09:20.310 --> 09:26.210
So let's save that and you're going to notice that the moment we in fact start scrolling.

09:26.380 --> 09:28.760
Then once we get past 62.

09:28.950 --> 09:35.580
Only then our NAV bar gets this classic fixed and again we can actually check this out how that happens

09:35.580 --> 09:41.700
dynamically if we're going to head over to our now bar in our Deftones notice we're going to have our

09:41.700 --> 09:44.260
NAV element and what is the class there.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.350
When the class is fixed.

09:45.780 --> 09:49.370
So if I'm going to scroll back then I'm going to have only napper.

09:49.440 --> 09:55.570
If we're going to scroll past 62 while then the now bar is wide awake going to have this class.

09:55.590 --> 10:01.050
So now as I was crawling up and down the document or nav bar is going to be fixed.

10:01.110 --> 10:06.060
So each and every time our user wants to access the number he or she can easily do it.

10:06.510 --> 10:13.800
So that would be setting up our NAV fixed to a top of the document as we start scrolling through our

10:13.800 --> 10:14.400
document.
