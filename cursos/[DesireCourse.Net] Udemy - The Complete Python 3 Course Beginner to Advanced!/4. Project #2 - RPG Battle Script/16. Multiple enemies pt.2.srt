1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,589
Let's try this again just to make

2

00:00:01,589  -->  00:00:04,920
sure everything works. Hit the attack,

3

00:00:04,920  -->  00:00:11,460
we're just going to attack right now, and

4

00:00:11,460  -->  00:00:15,750
enemy.get_hp so that as well and this is in

5

00:00:15,750  -->  00:00:19,050
line 150. So, now what we're going to need

6

00:00:19,050  -->  00:00:20,760
to do is we're going to need to change

7

00:00:20,760  -->  00:00:22,980
this to check

8

00:00:22,980  -->  00:00:25,890
you know for each enemy if each enemy

9

00:00:25,890  -->  00:00:27,359
is dead then we win.

10

00:00:27,359  -->  00:00:29,130
So what we're going to do is we're going

11

00:00:29,130  -->  00:00:40,530
to create an index of...and then defeated

12

00:00:40,530  -->  00:00:47,129
enemy means equals 0, and then for enemy

13

00:00:47,129  -->  00:00:58,140
in enemies, if emey.get_hp == 0: we are

14

00:00:58,140  -->  00:00:59,430
going to say

15

00:00:59,430  -->  00:01:08,880
defeated_enemies += 1. And so

16

00:01:08,880  -->  00:01:11,700
down here, out of this if loop

17

00:01:11,700  -->  00:01:15,090
statement, we're going to say if defeated

18

00:01:15,090  -->  00:01:17,700
enemies equals 2 then

19

00:01:17,700  -->  00:01:22,110
we've obviously won. We're going to do

20

00:01:22,110  -->  00:01:25,080
roughly the same thing for the players,

21

00:01:25,080  -->  00:01:33,659
so right here.

22

00:01:33,659  -->  00:01:47,130
defeated players = 0, for player in

23

00:01:47,130  -->  00:01:58,920
players: if player.get_hp == 0

24

00:01:58,920  -->  00:02:16,440
defeated_players += 1. This might not work...we'll find

25

00:02:16,440  -->  00:02:18,000
out though I mean I don't think it's

26

00:02:18,000  -->  00:02:23,970
going to. defeated_players

27

00:02:23,970  -->  00:02:28,379
Oh, no, that's going to work

28

00:02:28,379  -->  00:02:29,760
because we're going to set it to 0 and then it's

29

00:02:29,760  -->  00:02:31,109
going to check each time. I thought it

30

00:02:31,109  -->  00:02:32,910
was for some reason, I was thinking, it's

31

00:02:32,910  -->  00:02:35,250
going ok, so, defeated players let's say

32

00:02:35,250  -->  00:02:37,049
one person dies this is going to be 1,

33

00:02:37,049  -->  00:02:43,440
and so it's going to add to that so that

34

00:02:43,440  -->  00:02:45,420
each turn that went by it the same

35

00:02:45,420  -->  00:02:47,609
person is dead it's going to keep adding

36

00:02:47,609  -->  00:02:49,620
one, but it's not because we're setting

37

00:02:49,620  -->  00:02:51,450
these variables right at the end of the

38

00:02:51,450  -->  00:02:52,919
function. So before any of this

39

00:02:52,919  -->  00:02:56,849
runs it is already set to 0. So, if

40

00:02:56,849  -->  00:03:01,590
defeated players equals 2, your enemies

41

00:03:01,590  -->  00:03:06,269
have defeated you.

42

00:03:06,269  -->  00:03:09,269
So, now I believe this is the last bit, it

43

00:03:09,269  -->  00:03:12,329
should all work, there are a few other things

44

00:03:12,329  -->  00:03:18,780
we need to do. As you can see right there

45

00:03:18,780  -->  00:03:19,680
the Imp

46

00:03:19,680  -->  00:03:21,480
we're doing a great deal of damage, but

47

00:03:21,480  -->  00:03:28,829
Valos has taken some damage of magic here...

48

00:03:28,829  -->  00:03:34,500
alright.

49

00:03:34,500  -->  00:03:37,170
So, once targets hit points are zero,

50

00:03:37,170  -->  00:03:40,500
let's do this. Let's come back in here

51

00:03:40,500  -->  00:03:43,920
where we choose target for enemy and

52

00:03:43,920  -->  00:03:57,180
enemies, if enemy.get_hp  doesn't equal 0 then

53

00:03:57,180  -->  00:04:00,930
we're going to do this stuff. Once an

54

00:04:00,930  -->  00:04:03,000
enemy is dead

55

00:04:03,000  -->  00:04:06,060
we basically don't get the option to

56

00:04:06,060  -->  00:04:15,690
target. So as you can see now we've got two

57

00:04:15,690  -->  00:04:20,190
targets, but now the problem is that

58

00:04:20,190  -->  00:04:24,780
we need to remove it, we need to remove

59

00:04:24,780  -->  00:04:30,900
the enemy from the actual

60

00:04:30,900  -->  00:04:33,870
enemies list because if not we're going

61

00:04:33,870  -->  00:04:36,210
to choose one and it's going to actually

62

00:04:36,210  -->  00:04:39,900
attack Imp still, because that's making

63

00:04:39,900  -->  00:04:42,990
that is 0. So we're going to have to fix

64

00:04:42,990  -->  00:04:44,970
that as well and the way we're going to

65

00:04:44,970  -->  00:04:49,860
do that, let me return that hit point there,

66

00:04:49,860  -->  00:04:56,700
in the main script here let's see if we attack,

67

00:04:56,700  -->  00:05:01,500
let's also add another bit of code here. So, if

68

00:05:01,500  -->  00:05:13,140
enemies[enemy].get_hp == 0

69

00:05:13,140  -->  00:05:17,760
we're going to basically just delete

70

00:05:17,760  -->  00:05:23,310
enemies[enemy]. Then we're going to say,

71

00:05:23,310  -->  00:05:26,850
before we do that we're going to print

72

00:05:26,850  -->  00:05:34,060
out the enemy's name.

73

00:05:34,060  -->  00:05:47,620
There we go.

74

00:05:47,620  -->  00:05:52,690
We're going to do the same thing where

75

00:05:52,690  -->  00:05:57,430
we choose the enemy here in magic.

76

00:05:57,430  -->  00:05:59,410
So we're going to do it below that there,

77

00:05:59,410  -->  00:06:04,330
and then we're going to do the same

78

00:06:04,330  -->  00:06:07,930
thing under attack items right there,

79

00:06:07,930  -->  00:06:13,840
and we can actually clean up this code

80

00:06:13,840  -->  00:06:16,479
a bit. We can document it as well and

81

00:06:16,479  -->  00:06:26,380
probably before we actually do

82

00:06:26,380  -->  00:06:28,900
the well before I uploaded to the

83

00:06:28,900  -->  00:06:30,760
repository I will comment it so it's a

84

00:06:30,760  -->  00:06:36,400
lot more you know documented, so you

85

00:06:36,400  -->  00:06:39,250
guys can understand it. So, now what

86

00:06:39,250  -->  00:06:41,800
what should happen is he should have

87

00:06:41,800  -->  00:06:43,870
been deleted, so first off two things are

88

00:06:43,870  -->  00:06:45,760
going to happen. The next time it shows

89

00:06:45,760  -->  00:06:47,800
this readout it's not going to show that

90

00:06:47,800  -->  00:06:52,180
enemy, and two once we choose attack

91

00:06:52,180  -->  00:06:53,950
we're going to have an option to choose

92

00:06:53,950  -->  00:06:56,080
Magus or Imp and this should actually attack

93

00:06:56,080  -->  00:07:00,340
Magus now, and it does. So that's exactly

94

00:07:00,340  -->  00:07:03,039
what we want to happen. Now we're not

95

00:07:03,039  -->  00:07:04,990
going to really focus on if we're going

96

00:07:04,990  -->  00:07:06,940
to be able to beat this guy,

97

00:07:06,940  -->  00:07:09,370
what we're going to do is when we attack

98

00:07:09,370  -->  00:07:11,169
an enemy we're going to strip the white

99

00:07:11,169  -->  00:07:13,720
space from it. So how we're going to do

100

00:07:13,720  -->  00:07:18,460
that is where we print out enemy name we're

101

00:07:18,460  -->  00:07:28,689
going to say replace.

102

00:07:28,689  -->  00:07:30,279
We're going to do this each time we

103

00:07:30,279  -->  00:07:33,879
print out a string about an enemy.

104

00:07:33,879  -->  00:07:41,229
Up here where we do damage,

105

00:07:41,229  -->  00:07:50,229
oops that's what I meant to do, and

106

00:07:50,229  -->  00:07:53,679
then up here when we attack as well.

107

00:07:53,679  -->  00:07:56,739
Where is that?

108

00:07:56,739  -->  00:08:00,549
So, if they have died we need to do the same

109

00:08:00,549  -->  00:08:14,569
thing.

110

00:08:14,569  -->  00:08:19,429
Then we need to print out which enemy is

111

00:08:19,429  -->  00:08:22,729
attacking. Does one enemy attack only attack?

112

00:08:22,729  -->  00:08:25,999
Yeah, right, that's what we did we only

113

00:08:25,999  -->  00:08:27,860
made one enemy attack, so we will leave it

114

00:08:27,860  -->  00:08:30,949
there for now. So, let's save this, re-run it, and

115

00:08:30,949  -->  00:08:32,630
let's make sure that everything works

116

00:08:32,630  -->  00:08:35,060
se we're going to just demolish first

117

00:08:35,060  -->  00:08:38,029
character there. There we go and as you can see

118

00:08:38,029  -->  00:08:41,389
we're attacking Imp, and the white space has

119

00:08:41,389  -->  00:08:45,709
been removed. So, that's as far as we're

120

00:08:45,709  -->  00:08:47,089
going to go this time. I think I'm

121

00:08:47,089  -->  00:08:48,800
actually going to re-upload the code

122

00:08:48,800  -->  00:08:56,509
here to GitHub so you guys can see it, but

123

00:08:56,509  -->  00:08:58,069
this battle actually won't be too

124

00:08:58,069  -->  00:08:59,750
difficult. So we can just keep hammering

125

00:08:59,750  -->  00:09:05,269
with attacks and magic, until we have no hit

126

00:09:05,269  -->  00:09:06,860
points, but we also do have a mega

127

00:09:06,860  -->  00:09:09,319
elixir. So I'm gonna go ahead and use

128

00:09:09,319  -->  00:09:11,449
an item and I'm going to use a mega

129

00:09:11,449  -->  00:09:13,699
elixir,

130

00:09:13,699  -->  00:09:16,639
and then we're going to keep hammering

131

00:09:16,639  -->  00:09:21,649
this guy with magic until we

132

00:09:21,649  -->  00:09:23,930
defeat him. So I mean it's as you can see we

133

00:09:23,930  -->  00:09:25,399
haven't really made this too difficult, you

134

00:09:25,399  -->  00:09:26,660
don't really have to think, but that's

135

00:09:26,660  -->  00:09:28,670
again because one enemy is attacking you

136

00:09:28,670  -->  00:09:33,139
and not all of them, and they also don't

137

00:09:33,139  -->  00:09:35,750
heal. So once we implement those bits of

138

00:09:35,750  -->  00:09:36,649
code,

139

00:09:36,649  -->  00:09:42,800
there we go, then you know it's obviously

140

00:09:42,800  -->  00:09:46,699
going to make it more difficult.

141

00:09:46,699  -->  00:09:53,839
There we go. So, enemy damage the Imp has died.

142

00:09:53,839  -->  00:09:59,420
So, that's in line 155 right here, if the

143

00:09:59,420  -->  00:10:00,829
enemy has died they obviously can't

144

00:10:00,829  -->  00:10:02,990
attack. So that's obviously a

145

00:10:02,990  -->  00:10:04,519
problem we shouldn't have but we are

146

00:10:04,519  -->  00:10:10,630
going to fix it at some point as well.
