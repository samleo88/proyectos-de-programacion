00:00.240 --> 00:06.210
And again we made a comment here that this is going to be for portfolio or sponsor.

00:06.240 --> 00:11.210
And if we go back or here you can see that and this is what we have read so we have a massive image

00:11.220 --> 00:15.100
All right that's going to be actually spanning all across the screen.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.380
And that's not something that we would want.

00:17.380 --> 00:24.930
So what we're going to do over here again we're going to say this is going to be a media screen.

00:25.390 --> 00:32.790
We're going to say and I don't want you know going to see a man with this is going to be 576 pixels

00:33.830 --> 00:40.110
here curly braces and then I'm going to say we're here portfolio center.

00:40.210 --> 00:47.090
Know you are going to say this play when you say flex or hear this then we're going to have flex.

00:47.340 --> 00:51.520
So again if we say this can go and check it out what we have right.

00:51.540 --> 00:55.830
So right away you can see that they're actually in one big line over here.

00:55.830 --> 00:56.610
Right.

00:56.610 --> 00:57.670
So what do you want.

00:57.770 --> 01:00.480
Well here is actually a few things.

01:00.480 --> 01:03.550
So again as always we're going to have a flex rap.

01:03.690 --> 01:09.270
So every time we're actually shrinking it down they wrap to the next line and I don't hear the same

01:09.270 --> 01:13.810
thing just different content and space between doing this.

01:13.950 --> 01:18.680
And then for the actual work part we're here we're going to say work on it like this.

01:18.870 --> 01:25.550
And then we're going to say we're here and this is going to be flex and again zero for a growing zero

01:25.560 --> 01:32.910
for shrinking coke or coke again and we're going to say this is going to be 50 percent and let's say

01:32.910 --> 01:36.210
we're here minus 15 pixels.

01:36.260 --> 01:39.540
However remember over here with this space right.

01:39.540 --> 01:45.040
Otherwise the cost function is not going to work and all we're hearing and we're going to say this and

01:45.200 --> 01:52.590
this and once we refresh right now we can see that this is going to be a 50 percent story and then after

01:52.590 --> 01:54.610
that we would want for a bigger screen.

01:54.620 --> 01:55.230
Right.

01:55.290 --> 02:00.380
So again we can easily just grab this guy over here copy and paste it over here.

02:00.600 --> 02:04.060
And then what we're going to see over here and this is going to be seven.

02:04.090 --> 02:05.610
76 right.

02:05.770 --> 02:08.150
Delete this first part over here.

02:08.430 --> 02:14.030
And for the work world is going right and this is going to be three three point three.

02:14.230 --> 02:20.960
I guess I get it all going to say this and we're going to go back over here and now have three of them.

02:21.150 --> 02:23.130
All right so now there's three of them.

02:23.130 --> 02:27.730
So as I'm hovering right you can see that the bottom part is coming up.

02:27.780 --> 02:33.010
This one is actually changing and it's the same deal and the same here.

02:33.030 --> 02:38.630
And obviously for all of them and now we're ready to move on to our next section.
