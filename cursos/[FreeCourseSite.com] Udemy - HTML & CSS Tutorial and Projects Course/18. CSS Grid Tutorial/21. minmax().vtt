When we work with see it says grid there is also a min max function available to us which is a very

00:08.400 --> 00:10.240
very nifty function.

00:10.250 --> 00:14.040
So in this video I would like to cover it in more detail.

00:14.040 --> 00:17.320
So first and foremost notes getter of old stuff.

00:17.490 --> 00:20.610
So it on it so no one either.

00:20.790 --> 00:26.550
Let me make sure that I don't lead the curly braces that is going to stay.

00:26.620 --> 00:28.830
And now let's imagine the scenario.

00:28.830 --> 00:35.910
So let's say I do have three fractions correct but I don't like the fact that as my screen size gets

00:35.910 --> 00:38.520
smaller all of them get smaller.

00:38.520 --> 00:42.110
Now I would be OK with cell number one and cell number three.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.900
Similarly some number four in cell number six.

00:45.060 --> 00:52.260
But the second column I would want to have some kind of mean with whether or not it was gonna be three

00:52.260 --> 00:59.940
hundred pixels or two hundred pixels essentially I would want my second column to stay some kind of

01:00.090 --> 01:01.740
minimal with.

01:01.740 --> 01:07.730
Otherwise as you can see the moment my screen size gets bigger it's awesome of them get bigger.

01:07.860 --> 01:11.200
But the moment it get smaller all of them shrink.

01:11.220 --> 01:12.270
So how do we do that.

01:12.690 --> 01:19.320
Well first of all let's change this and let's just write one fraction one fraction and one fraction

01:19.680 --> 01:20.400
right now.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.680
Technically we didn't do anything correct.

01:22.680 --> 01:23.820
We had a repeat function.

01:23.820 --> 01:27.230
Now we just rewrote with 1 fraction 1 fraction 1 fraction.

01:27.670 --> 01:32.380
However for the middle column because this is where I would like to applied.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.210
And of course we can use the same thing for the first column.

01:35.340 --> 01:38.880
Third Column or write on all fifty five thousand column.

01:38.890 --> 01:43.500
Doesn't matter I'm just showing you the middle one because I think it's just gonna be easier to see

01:43.500 --> 01:44.070
that.

01:44.130 --> 01:51.240
So let's write min max and then within the min max function we need to supply two values first of all

01:51.250 --> 01:57.120
is going to be well what would be the minimal value for our column more for a row.

01:57.120 --> 02:03.390
So in our case it's after the column so I'm going to say you know what minimal my column should be three

02:03.390 --> 02:07.110
hundred pixels and then comma and then what would be the max.

02:07.110 --> 02:08.910
Well the max could be one fraction.

02:08.910 --> 02:11.140
So has my screen size gets bigger.

02:11.160 --> 02:18.300
Course I would want them to be evenly spaced but as my screen size gets smaller I wouldn't want my second

02:18.300 --> 02:21.570
column to be less than 300 pixels.

02:21.570 --> 02:22.590
Let's save it.

02:22.620 --> 02:28.050
And you're going to notice right away that there is going to be a massive massive second column.

02:28.140 --> 02:31.110
Now in my case obviously it's also because I have zoomed in.

02:31.470 --> 02:33.120
So let me zoom out.

02:33.180 --> 02:36.210
But then as our screen size gets bigger.

02:36.210 --> 02:39.990
Notice of course they have each of them a fraction.

02:40.020 --> 02:41.650
So they're growing together.

02:41.790 --> 02:49.650
But as my screen size gets smaller you're going to check it out that the first and the third are going

02:49.650 --> 02:53.440
to get less and less so that you can shrink and shrink harder.

02:53.460 --> 03:00.360
The second one is going to stay big because we did set up this min max function with a value of let's

03:00.360 --> 03:01.620
say 300.

03:01.620 --> 03:06.450
Now let's change it to four and then for sure we're going to see where the first one and the third one

03:06.780 --> 03:08.150
are much more smaller.

03:08.460 --> 03:10.720
But the second one is not going to shrink.

03:10.800 --> 03:17.760
This is going to be very useful when we're going to try to set up a column layout without the media

03:17.760 --> 03:19.080
queries.

03:19.080 --> 03:21.690
So essentially we would want to use a media query.

03:21.690 --> 03:24.960
We would just want to set up some kind of values using them in Max.

03:25.080 --> 03:30.680
And the worry we're gonna get there in fact we're going to get there as we start working with our CSX

03:30.730 --> 03:31.320
grid.

03:31.440 --> 03:38.690
Many projects but essentially this would be a min max function where we can pass a minimal value on

03:38.700 --> 03:40.020
a maximum value.

03:40.020 --> 03:48.100
And that way our column or our row is not going to go below this first value the minimal.

03:48.390 --> 03:53.340
But it's going to stay up all the way to the max value that we specified.

03:53.340 --> 03:57.390
And in most cases that probably is going to be a fraction of value.
