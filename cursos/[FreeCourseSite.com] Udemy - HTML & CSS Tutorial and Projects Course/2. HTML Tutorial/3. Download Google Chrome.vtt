00:00.590 --> 00:03.430
First I'll start by getting the Google Chrome browser.

00:03.560 --> 00:10.310
So I'm going to open up whatever default browser I have on my machine and I'm just gonna say Google

00:10.910 --> 00:16.190
Chrome and we can maybe add I don't know download because this should always point us to the right direction

00:16.190 --> 00:17.010
anyway.

00:17.140 --> 00:21.080
And as you can see we have the most secure browser on the web.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.690
Just click it over here and we have an option for downloading.

00:24.290 --> 00:27.810
And we just bravely click here accept and install.

00:27.830 --> 00:33.060
And this is gonna be installed on my machine once the download it has been completed.

00:33.110 --> 00:39.080
We can head over to downloads and notice your here we have the installer package so we can just click

00:39.080 --> 00:44.590
on the package and noticed right away it gives us the Google Chrome so we can just drag and drop it

00:44.600 --> 00:47.920
or applications just so we can have it available.

00:47.970 --> 00:53.480
And right now it's saying that it's copying to the applications and we should have it available to us

00:53.570 --> 00:54.920
in no time.

00:54.920 --> 00:59.990
Now once the installation has been completed you can just close it over here and if you want you can

00:59.990 --> 01:05.510
just reject the Google Chrome and you can just look for it in the application.

01:05.510 --> 01:08.860
So let me see where in the applications I have to go chrome.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.820
So first of all let me open this.

01:10.970 --> 01:16.760
And once I open it up oh here it's going to ask me whether I'm OK with this being the application from

01:16.760 --> 01:17.610
the web.

01:17.750 --> 01:21.260
I'm going to say yes that I would like to open it as well as I would right away.

01:21.260 --> 01:22.760
Gonna set it up in a dock.

01:22.850 --> 01:26.440
So I'm just going to right click it and this is gonna keep it in the dock.

01:26.460 --> 01:30.670
Now also right away I like to make this a default browser.

01:30.680 --> 01:35.060
Now again you don't have to do this but I would suggest that you do that with me.

01:35.360 --> 01:40.690
Just remember that depending on your operating system you might need to take different steps.

01:40.910 --> 01:46.790
Now on a Mac I'm gonna head over for this icon all the way on the top right corner and just gonna click

01:46.790 --> 01:47.490
on it.

01:47.540 --> 01:52.480
So as you can see over here we have the settings part and we can just click on the settings link.

01:52.730 --> 01:57.680
Now within the settings we're going to scroll down a little bit and notice here we have make it has

01:57.680 --> 01:58.130
a default.

01:58.570 --> 02:03.450
So I'm just gonna click it over here and I'm gonna say that yes I would like to use Chrome as my default.

02:03.740 --> 02:09.230
And that pretty much completes our downloading of chrome and setting it up as our default browser.
