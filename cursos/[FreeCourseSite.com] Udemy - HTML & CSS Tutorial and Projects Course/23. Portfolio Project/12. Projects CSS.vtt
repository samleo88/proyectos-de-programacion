WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:06.900
Words go ahead to a main see a sense here and let's go all the way from the bottom where we have the

00:06.960 --> 00:12.660
end of number section and then once we have the end of numbers our hero going to say that this is going

00:12.660 --> 00:17.150
to be project here and right away let's copy and paste this.

00:17.300 --> 00:24.510
I'm going to say and of project once we have created these comments all your comments actually create

00:24.510 --> 00:25.550
this action.

00:25.590 --> 00:30.960
So I'm just going to create a little bit more space and on here I'm going to say first project.

00:30.960 --> 00:37.440
So we're going to be targeting the whole section here and we're going to say first as always we're going

00:37.440 --> 00:42.650
to have padding top bottom three RPMs in order here zero.

00:42.660 --> 00:45.800
So top bottom is going to be three left and right.

00:45.840 --> 00:50.580
It's going to be zero and we're also going to do a background and we're going to use Vire for this.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.020
And this is going to be the light color.

00:53.340 --> 00:59.370
So we're going to use a light background and once we have set the background for the whole section then

00:59.370 --> 01:02.730
we would want to center everything and for that we have the device.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.900
So we're going to say projects here.

01:05.060 --> 01:07.080
And to underscore center.

01:07.080 --> 01:10.650
So this is going to be used for horizontal Center.

01:10.870 --> 01:15.790
We don't want to say max width so he cannot exceed certain.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.880
And this is going to be 90.

01:17.880 --> 01:25.080
You know we're here we're going to have a margin to R.E.M. So that's going to be touch bottom and all

01:25.110 --> 01:27.760
you're going to say are really this.

01:27.810 --> 01:34.270
So we say this here and you can see right now that I have my margin in between us.

01:34.370 --> 01:40.650
Now once we have our project center done now let's actually work with a single project.

01:40.890 --> 01:46.650
So we're we're going to have a class of project going on here we're going to have a project to underscores

01:46.960 --> 01:49.560
and know this is going to be single project.

01:49.560 --> 01:55.640
So this is going to be the single article that's holding the actual photo and the Fantasma might go

01:55.650 --> 01:58.120
up and on here we're going to start like this.

01:58.220 --> 02:04.780
Going to say first that there is going to be margin on the top or here one on Reems and all your insides.

02:05.010 --> 02:07.620
You know what Actually let's do our dreams.

02:07.890 --> 02:09.470
Let's make it a little bit bigger.

02:09.480 --> 02:14.580
So what I'm doing right now I'm just making creating some space in between them.

02:14.790 --> 02:17.250
The actual screen size is more.

02:17.430 --> 02:23.510
And also what I want is I would want a position and this would be a position relative because again

02:23.510 --> 02:30.030
what we're going to do here with this overlay we're going to use this before we're here and we're going

02:30.030 --> 02:32.360
to set it as an absolute.

02:32.370 --> 02:39.540
So if we want to do this we need to set this guy or here the actual container as a relative.

02:39.570 --> 02:44.210
So this is why we're doing it now once we're done with an actual container.

02:44.220 --> 02:46.350
Now let's do a project here.

02:46.470 --> 02:49.320
Single project and going to target.

02:49.540 --> 02:56.660
Or we would want for the image of first we would want a display and we're going to say block then we

02:56.660 --> 02:59.590
would want a with more here of hundred.

02:59.610 --> 03:04.710
So this is going to make sure that our image always fit all here nicely.

03:04.860 --> 03:11.490
And also would want a border radius it's really going to say border and radius and we're going to create

03:11.490 --> 03:15.010
these Borrego just so we have some rounded just over here.

03:15.020 --> 03:21.540
So once I say it you see now the House rounded edges and once we're done with an image let's actually

03:21.540 --> 03:23.030
create a overlay.

03:23.220 --> 03:26.270
So like I said for this we're going to be using before.

03:26.330 --> 03:28.760
So we're all going to write projects here.

03:28.980 --> 03:35.910
Single project and what we're going to have is a common one and we'll get right on here before.

03:35.910 --> 03:42.690
So basically what we're doing is we are creating something that's not in the HD now and what we're going

03:42.690 --> 03:49.590
to do is we're going to position an absolute and we'll use the fact that the container container has

03:49.590 --> 03:51.710
the position relative here.

03:51.850 --> 03:57.210
So we're going to go back on here and we're going to say that this is going to be a content or here

03:57.420 --> 04:00.420
of content of nothing premature here.

04:00.420 --> 04:05.370
So this is going to be the empty content then we're going to do a background for the background going

04:05.370 --> 04:09.870
to do a VAR and we're going to do a dark one on this.

04:09.870 --> 04:15.810
Then once we have the background now we would need to set the width and height the width and height

04:15.820 --> 04:18.190
I'm going to say 100 percent here.

04:18.330 --> 04:22.300
And also for the height I'm going to set a person on here like this.

04:22.380 --> 04:27.410
Most likely this is going to be taking up the whole background of the container.

04:27.430 --> 04:34.680
Now once we have the width and height now I would want is a position here and for the position what

04:34.680 --> 04:36.400
I would want is actually absol.

04:36.540 --> 04:42.390
Like I said because actually I would want to play play like this so you can see right now that basically

04:42.420 --> 04:47.990
this before is covering the whole thing because now we have the position.

04:48.390 --> 04:51.360
However we would want to do a few things already.

04:51.600 --> 04:57.170
Well first of all we're going to say here is this is going to be transform and this is going to be scale.

04:57.450 --> 05:07.060
So you can imagine this scale for the transform is actually going to be multiplying the actual height

05:07.150 --> 05:09.100
and the width of an element.

05:09.130 --> 05:12.580
So we're here we're going to have a scale of 1.2.

05:12.610 --> 05:16.170
This is going to be actually multiplying and making a bigger.

05:16.390 --> 05:18.940
How are we going to go with the scale of zero.

05:18.940 --> 05:25.710
Here you can see that he basically disappears and the way we're going to get this effect is we're going

05:25.710 --> 05:27.800
to change the scale as we're having.

05:28.090 --> 05:35.590
So basically what we're saying is when we're not having scale back to zero and when we're hovering scale

05:35.710 --> 05:37.340
whatever you're actually worth.

05:37.610 --> 05:44.920
So here let's do a sort of transition because we would want this change happen over time not right away.

05:45.100 --> 05:48.460
So I'm going to say all one second is more here.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.900
So this is going to be my transition.

05:51.010 --> 05:58.300
So once I have written these properties now I always do a hover for us and for the hover effect like

05:58.300 --> 06:05.280
I said we're going to have a project single project before however or here I'm going to have a hover

06:05.650 --> 06:07.140
and that I'm going to have before.

06:07.330 --> 06:10.900
So this will be the syntax that we have project single project.

06:10.900 --> 06:15.540
Then we're all hovering and then we'll have before and then what we would want to do.

06:15.540 --> 06:23.590
Like I said now we would want a transform and I'll just say here scale and instead of scaling it bigger

06:23.900 --> 06:26.590
we're just going to say scale back to one or here.

06:26.830 --> 06:30.790
So as I'm hovering this is actually going to scale like this.

06:30.850 --> 06:35.830
So this is how it's going to look like and also what we would want is actually would want to change

06:35.830 --> 06:41.080
the opacity because you can see that it's totally dark and this is not something that we would want.

06:41.130 --> 06:46.960
So we're going to go back over here and we're going to say that originally I'd say opacity is going

06:46.960 --> 06:49.010
to be something like 0 0.

06:49.210 --> 06:55.330
However as we are hovering over we're going to set an opacity to something I don't know.

06:55.330 --> 06:57.310
Something like 0.5 here.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.990
So we still can see the image and likeness.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.200
So as you can see now as I'm hovering my overlay is showing and we're using the scale over here.

07:07.480 --> 07:15.100
You can see that here we made the actual element smaller by actually scaling up to zero hour as we are

07:15.100 --> 07:15.900
hovering.

07:15.930 --> 07:20.310
We're scaling back to one more which would be hundred with 200 high.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.930
And then over here this would be in the past.

07:22.930 --> 07:26.900
Now the last thing that I would want to work with is actually going to be the idea.

07:27.010 --> 07:33.310
So let me go down here and I'm going to say project where some of this is going to be in class going

07:33.400 --> 07:39.080
on here and this is going to be I'm sorry but I'm just going to change from the line read to Mike on

07:39.500 --> 07:40.060
this.

07:40.060 --> 07:45.250
So what I would want with an icon and this is actually going to be very similar to what we were doing

07:45.250 --> 07:45.890
before.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.790
So first let's do a color here.

07:49.030 --> 07:52.620
And what's the color var on here of light.

07:52.630 --> 07:55.600
So first let's set a light color.

07:55.630 --> 08:00.940
However we have a bug because you can see or hear that has I'm selecting the car.

08:01.060 --> 08:02.950
Nothing is actually changing.

08:03.190 --> 08:10.090
So I'm going to go back over here to the next page now and you can see that I have not a project but

08:10.090 --> 08:12.040
I have all here next.

08:12.310 --> 08:16.590
So what I'm going to do here I'm going to delete all the Easy's or here.

08:16.600 --> 08:23.530
So let me go back over here and just select everywhere where you have the and just delete it and then

08:23.530 --> 08:24.900
we're going to be working fine.

08:25.170 --> 08:29.020
So here I'm going to go all the way down to the last one.

08:29.240 --> 08:35.680
So this is going to be a project and this guy over here is also going to be a project.

08:35.710 --> 08:41.740
So once I say it now I can see that I can see the icons because the actual color is white.

08:41.800 --> 08:44.040
So now we know that everything is working.

08:44.200 --> 08:51.720
And once we have set the color of white and also we would want to have a position animal first going

08:51.730 --> 08:53.200
to say position absolute.

08:53.500 --> 08:58.700
Now we're going to do basically the same thing since we know that the container is going to be relative.

08:58.900 --> 09:04.190
So this is going to work as a holder for a position absolute.

09:04.330 --> 09:07.330
Now we can basically place the icon anywhere we want.

09:07.330 --> 09:09.030
So where we would want the icon.

09:09.280 --> 09:14.910
Well we're going to say we're here and this is going to be top and this is going to be 50 percent then

09:14.920 --> 09:19.590
we're going to have eight left or so 50 percent on this.

09:19.740 --> 09:23.830
And once we say it you can see that this is going to be a little like on here.

09:23.930 --> 09:26.130
And I also want to make a bigger size.

09:26.130 --> 09:32.970
I'm going to say font size and the font size and say six RPMs like this.

09:32.970 --> 09:36.100
So once we save it you can see that like on his own here.

09:36.210 --> 09:43.120
However as you can see here once we actually increase the font size you can see that our icon has shifted

09:43.120 --> 09:45.760
from the center all the way over here.

09:45.790 --> 09:53.320
So what we would need to do is actually use the CCS transform and actually use the Translink or we actually

09:53.320 --> 09:58.360
would use the actual height and the width of an actual icon and just get rid of it.

09:58.420 --> 10:05.040
So we're going to say this is going to be 50 percent or translation to the X and 50 percent of the way.

10:05.270 --> 10:10.450
So basically half of your height and width are really going to work right like this.

10:10.450 --> 10:17.420
We're going to say transform how this is going to be trancelike negative 50 percent here and also negative

10:17.420 --> 10:18.550
50 percent.

10:18.560 --> 10:23.610
So the first one is going to be X action and the second one is going to be y direction.

10:23.750 --> 10:26.770
So now the icon is actually exactly in the center.

10:27.050 --> 10:30.990
So once we have done this now we would want to do two things.

10:31.100 --> 10:36.020
First of all here let's make the opacity of this icon of zero.

10:36.140 --> 10:38.550
So now I can see that it's actually going to disappear.

10:38.750 --> 10:41.310
They're also going to do another transform.

10:41.420 --> 10:47.240
So going right on here and this is going to be scale so see that we can just write the second one let's

10:47.240 --> 10:52.020
say or here in front of it and we're going to do the same thing like we did before.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.790
So this is going to be transform scale of zero.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.160
So basically this is not going to be showing.

10:57.170 --> 10:59.230
And also the size is going to be zero.

10:59.700 --> 11:05.690
Once we have scaled it the last thing is going to be or year a transition and from tradition we're going

11:05.690 --> 11:06.880
to say all.

11:07.040 --> 11:13.260
And one point three seconds is this is going to be our transition.

11:13.580 --> 11:16.340
Now what actually should happen as well.

11:16.670 --> 11:23.600
Well first of all we're all going to say is as we're hovering over the high can we project I can as

11:23.600 --> 11:27.500
we're hovering over the actual icon we would want to change the color.

11:27.860 --> 11:33.380
So we're going to say color are really gray and gray.

11:33.440 --> 11:38.810
So this is going to be our color we're all going to be able to see it once we actually do something

11:38.810 --> 11:39.520
else.

11:39.740 --> 11:43.180
So don't worry about it for now we'll just have our color fixed.

11:43.200 --> 11:49.940
So once we have our color Great now we would want to have the actual icon appear as we were hovering

11:49.940 --> 11:51.440
over this container.

11:51.440 --> 11:58.670
So for this we're going to say a project or single project however so has we're hovering over the single

11:58.670 --> 12:03.190
project not what we would want is a project and here icon.

12:03.590 --> 12:10.100
So basically I'm saying as I'm hovering over the container I would want something done to this icon.

12:10.360 --> 12:15.510
And what I would want for the item first I would want a city of one.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.650
So this one was a positive zero.

12:18.660 --> 12:20.550
So basically it was invisible.

12:20.600 --> 12:28.400
Now it's 100 percent visible here let's change the transform so we're all going to say scale and we're

12:28.400 --> 12:33.990
going to say scale of one to pretty much the same thing that we did over here before.

12:34.010 --> 12:39.000
So as we're hovering over here you can see that now I have my eye on it.

12:39.070 --> 12:45.440
Now I also need to do this trancelike because if we did translate originally you could see that as I'm

12:45.440 --> 12:46.220
hovering.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.960
This is actually going back down here.

12:49.030 --> 12:51.510
So let's do the same thing with a translator.

12:51.800 --> 12:58.760
And we're going to say again negative 50 percent down here negative 50 percent or so if I'm going to

12:58.760 --> 13:02.390
go back on here now I can see that my actions is going up.

13:02.510 --> 13:08.300
Now we also can save a little bit of code and we can just skip the original one because it's not like

13:08.300 --> 13:11.040
we can see it anyway and not once we save it.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.780
You can see that right now my eye kind is going to be exactly in the center.

13:15.120 --> 13:21.830
So once we're actually done with working with an image now we would want to work with the flex marks

13:22.250 --> 13:28.530
and fix or lay out because you can see or hear that we have a four column lay out over here and if we're

13:28.700 --> 13:32.390
going to go to the small screen then we're going to have a two column way.

13:32.750 --> 13:36.550
And by now we already should know how we would need to do this.

13:36.770 --> 13:44.150
So we're all going to say media screen and I'm going to say and men and I were here and this is going

13:44.150 --> 13:46.780
to be women where now for the men with.

13:46.820 --> 13:47.970
I'm going to pick this time.

13:47.970 --> 13:52.300
So hundred sixty eight pixels on here and I'm going to say.

13:52.300 --> 13:58.580
Project Center because this is going to be the wrapper that actually is holding all of them.

13:58.580 --> 14:00.370
So all going to go back to the next stage.

14:00.390 --> 14:07.970
Now you can see that I'm making this guy or hear my flex box parent because this is holding all the

14:08.060 --> 14:13.920
images or all the actual containers seriousness is going to be my project center.

14:14.010 --> 14:20.710
So if I'm going to go back over here and I'm going to say project center now what I would want with

14:20.710 --> 14:26.030
it a first would be display flex and likeness.

14:26.180 --> 14:29.940
Then I would want a justify content on here.

14:30.050 --> 14:35.990
And again I'm going to say space between here because we're going to be setting margin in between them.

14:36.050 --> 14:38.920
You also would want a flex ramp.

14:39.010 --> 14:45.560
We're going to just wrap it just so when we ever get to the smaller screen and actually wraps the next

14:45.560 --> 14:46.000
line.

14:46.310 --> 14:48.620
So this would be the parent content.

14:48.800 --> 14:55.330
Now for the single project what you want is a project single project no here going to say like this

14:55.340 --> 15:00.100
we're going to say what's 0 0 your coke.

15:00.120 --> 15:05.850
So I'm going to be calculating again and again for the small screen we're going to have 50 percent because

15:05.850 --> 15:08.800
we would want to divide the screen in half.

15:09.050 --> 15:11.900
This is going to be our aims.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.700
So we saved it and now we can check it out.

15:14.710 --> 15:21.750
Well we have where we have a portfolio record a fresh air here and you can see that there has to be

15:21.750 --> 15:25.360
some kind of bug because right now our layout is not working.

15:25.590 --> 15:30.830
So I'm going to go back or hearing and see that I have a Coke is actually my spot.

15:30.850 --> 15:37.800
So once I save it and I'm going to go back over here and afresh I can see that my images are worth now

15:37.800 --> 15:40.870
once I have set up for 768.

15:41.010 --> 15:45.390
Now want a four column out at a 9 9 2.

15:45.600 --> 15:52.620
So in this case we can just grab this media on here so like the whole thing and just copy and paste

15:52.640 --> 15:57.810
this let me go back over here and just select the whole thing.

15:58.200 --> 16:03.970
So now once we actually copy and paste this now we're going to write it over here nine and two.

16:04.200 --> 16:09.240
So this is going to be the pixels then we can just get rid of this whole thing because this is going

16:09.240 --> 16:10.920
to stay exactly the same.

16:10.920 --> 16:16.210
Now we're going to change it to twenty five percent or so once I save it.

16:16.350 --> 16:21.840
And once they refresh it at eight nine nine till you can see them this is going to be my way.

16:21.840 --> 16:26.640
So now I have four more here campaigners side by side.

16:26.670 --> 16:30.440
However if I'm going to go to the smaller image or here you can see that.

16:30.480 --> 16:33.420
Now there are going to be two of them like this.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.980
And now we are ready to move on to our next section.
