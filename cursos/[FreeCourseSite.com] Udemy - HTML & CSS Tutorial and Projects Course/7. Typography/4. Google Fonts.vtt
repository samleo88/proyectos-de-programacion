00:00.510 --> 00:05.280
Thanks to Google funds we are not limited in just picking our phones over here.

00:05.310 --> 00:11.960
In fact we can get them from that awesome resource and we can include them in our project.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.580
So how does that work.

00:13.590 --> 00:14.990
Not before we actually cover.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.430
Let me just quickly show you that if we're looking for generic font families we can check them out in

00:20.430 --> 00:21.460
the Visual Studio code.

00:21.900 --> 00:26.850
So again we can create maybe a new line of code that's right on family.

00:26.850 --> 00:31.500
And notice here in the bottom all the single ones are going to recursive fantasy.

00:31.590 --> 00:34.880
Now don't look at inherit initial and onset.

00:35.010 --> 00:40.080
We don't care about those but you'll see again all the files that I just mentioned which would be the

00:40.080 --> 00:40.880
generic ones.

00:41.010 --> 00:43.220
Again that's basically a side note.

00:43.350 --> 00:48.720
Now let me delete this one family and you know what I will gonna get rid of this for now because I would

00:48.720 --> 00:52.210
like to show you how we can use the awesome Google font.

00:52.290 --> 00:57.300
So so far we do have no phone family property as well as obviously no value.

00:57.300 --> 00:59.360
So I'm gonna head over to the browser.

00:59.610 --> 01:04.730
I'm gonna maybe open up the new tab then we're gonna write Google wants.

01:04.970 --> 01:05.860
That's all we have to do.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.100
And then we're looking for Google fonts.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.100
This is gonna bring us to the URL.

01:10.260 --> 01:16.680
We're going to bravely click on a link and while we have our fonts and again there is many many fans

01:16.710 --> 01:18.370
we can pick over here.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.480
There's many options that we can pick.

01:20.550 --> 01:24.120
Let's say we can pick on the styles the likeness and the slant.

01:24.120 --> 01:28.480
So let's say let's try to get a really slanted and thick one.

01:28.830 --> 01:32.750
So I'm going to click on the slant and I'm going to increase the slant.

01:32.780 --> 01:35.400
Now we see that the slant is increasing.

01:35.610 --> 01:38.150
So maybe let's include a little bit thicker.

01:38.340 --> 01:45.150
And what happens is now it tells me listen buddy you pick thickness and slant and realistically you

01:45.150 --> 01:48.050
can have one of these two and that's fine.

01:48.060 --> 01:51.870
So in order to pick a font you can just click over here on this plus plus sign.

01:52.350 --> 01:57.360
And then in the bottom we're getting the phone now in the for the font we have two options how we can

01:57.360 --> 01:58.180
include it.

01:58.470 --> 02:01.650
We can import it more we can use the link.

02:01.870 --> 02:04.110
Now how is that going to look at both of them.

02:04.110 --> 02:05.590
Just so we have covered that.

02:05.730 --> 02:11.910
But just to give you a general idea then also we have an option of customizing it so we can add custom

02:11.910 --> 02:12.330
options.

02:12.330 --> 02:14.510
Well in this case there's not many of them.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.140
There's just one regular 400.

02:16.170 --> 02:22.510
Why don't we pick a popular font where we can maybe see more customizable options and also by the way

02:22.510 --> 02:25.330
it tells you the load to which in our case is gonna be fast.

02:25.890 --> 02:26.730
So far so good.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.490
Again we're going back to embed.

02:28.540 --> 02:30.150
You can just minimize this.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.470
And now we can search for them.

02:31.980 --> 02:36.150
And by the way you can see that there's going to be some articles if you're looking for something as

02:36.150 --> 02:38.750
well as we have an option for let's say trending.

02:38.790 --> 02:41.580
Now I'm gonna get rid of this thickness and slant.

02:41.580 --> 02:46.650
So this is basically going to stay simple and then probably the most used one that you're gonna see

02:46.650 --> 02:48.030
is going to be rubato.

02:48.030 --> 02:49.740
This is very popular.

02:49.740 --> 02:55.800
But let's say you can say Check here for trending popular date added or alphabetical.

02:55.890 --> 02:57.330
Let's look for the popular one.

02:57.330 --> 03:02.360
And sure enough we have the rubato like I said and we have opened since then.

03:02.370 --> 03:08.240
This guy also again there's quite a few that are very popular but rubato you'll probably see a lot.

03:09.090 --> 03:12.560
And again we know already how to pick it you can just click on it.

03:12.570 --> 03:17.640
Now we have to find families selected and let's head over again to the customize as like I said this

03:17.640 --> 03:18.740
is going to be an option.

03:18.900 --> 03:22.470
And then with rubato notice that we have more option.

03:22.640 --> 03:28.500
So let's say if we would want bold somehow and italic but right away tells you that now the low time

03:28.500 --> 03:29.630
is going to suffer.

03:29.640 --> 03:35.430
So keep in mind that I know that everyone likes to be artistic especially in the beginning as you start

03:35.430 --> 03:42.960
working with CSX basically learning CSX but also understand that this will going to affect your user

03:43.170 --> 03:43.770
experience.

03:44.100 --> 03:48.980
So probably don't try to take it too seriously and go too crazy.

03:48.990 --> 03:50.610
Now in my case I don't really care.

03:50.610 --> 03:53.360
Of course we can just add that just to see how it looks.

03:53.490 --> 03:56.250
But in general just keep that in mind.

03:56.250 --> 04:02.790
Now again we're going to head over to embedding and Nick already previously mentioned we have two options.

04:02.790 --> 04:09.760
Again we can use the link that would be included in our success meaning when I say CSX basically in

04:09.760 --> 04:15.240
our normal or we can do the actual embedding I'm sorry importing.

04:15.530 --> 04:16.140
OK.

04:16.170 --> 04:21.270
We have the link let's say this let's say link and the way we would need to include it we're going to

04:21.270 --> 04:27.810
head all back to indexation email and let's say right before our starts business we're going to maybe

04:27.810 --> 04:29.170
make a comment first.

04:29.280 --> 04:36.300
Well let's say Google wants Google farms and let's copy and paste this line and again Please don't delete

04:36.300 --> 04:37.320
something here.

04:37.320 --> 04:42.810
Just copy paste the way this comes from the Google and then we're going to head over here and notice

04:42.820 --> 04:43.850
that they tell us.

04:44.190 --> 04:50.100
Well if you want the font family the one that's gonna be thickness and slant then you would need to

04:50.100 --> 04:51.400
write this type of code.

04:51.570 --> 04:54.810
And then just a normal one robot would be something like this.

04:55.260 --> 05:01.410
So again let me select maybe the first one here and we'll going to head over to LCROSS maybe before

05:01.410 --> 05:08.370
we do that let's save the indexation email and then within the style assess I would want this for my

05:08.370 --> 05:08.910
having won.

05:09.340 --> 05:14.970
So I'm going to have this one family forum having one and then for main one for the body.

05:14.970 --> 05:20.370
I'm just going to use the normal rubato and I'm going to copy and paste that and I'm gonna say it.

05:20.520 --> 05:26.970
Now my hearing right now has obviously this one family and then the rest of my body which obviously

05:26.970 --> 05:32.240
in my case is only a paragraph has this type of fund family which is rock bottom.

05:32.670 --> 05:34.800
OK one last thing.

05:34.800 --> 05:38.070
Let's check it out how we can import it now for importing.

05:38.070 --> 05:40.370
We just need to click it out here and you know what.

05:40.710 --> 05:47.550
Let's change it around let's head over back to our document and just comment so so that way we know

05:47.550 --> 05:51.720
for sure that our import is actually going to work and we do it like this.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.120
I'm going to comment this out.

05:53.190 --> 05:56.220
I'm going to save it and noticed right now.

05:56.220 --> 05:58.710
So not definitely having the same font right.

05:59.070 --> 06:04.320
So again let me comment this and your knowledge that fonts are going to look like this but then once

06:04.320 --> 06:07.350
I'm going to comment this out the font are gonna change.

06:07.440 --> 06:10.070
So now I know that my fans are not included.

06:10.090 --> 06:15.810
Okay let's just get out let's say that again we would need to copy and paste this line of code.

06:15.820 --> 06:17.000
Let's copy and paste it.

06:17.370 --> 06:21.690
Let's head over to the styles and write on the top here.

06:21.690 --> 06:24.860
Maybe even above the comments although it's obviously unnecessary.

06:24.870 --> 06:27.130
But let me just put it all the way at the top.

06:27.540 --> 06:33.180
And now again my phones are working because I'm grabbing the exact phones that were used and this is

06:33.180 --> 06:37.230
how you can get Amber up and running with Google fonts in your project.
