Hey guys.

00:01.060 --> 00:06.610
Before we deep dive into the course let me quickly go over the structure of the course and probably

00:06.610 --> 00:10.280
more importantly why the Course is structured that way.

00:10.360 --> 00:16.270
The main focus of the course is to cover most aspects of the email and say assess.

00:16.420 --> 00:21.300
Now we need to be realistic though there is no course in the world that covers everything.

00:21.370 --> 00:25.010
So the idea is to get you comfortable with both technology.

00:25.180 --> 00:30.940
The problem is that there is no way for me to evaluate how far into the web world you're currently in.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.920
Maybe this is your first experience with age the amount you assess or maybe you already know each.

00:37.150 --> 00:40.130
And just want to learn more about this as great.

00:40.150 --> 00:43.810
What I'm trying to say is that since course has multiple tutorials.

00:43.990 --> 00:47.890
You'll need to pick a starting point that is most comfortable for you.

00:48.040 --> 00:52.250
Let's say you are a beginner you would start with the very first videos about the demo.

00:52.780 --> 00:58.330
If you already know each CML you would jump straight into the ISIS and you get the point.

00:58.360 --> 01:04.860
Like I said before course will be hands on project based because personally slides put me to sleep.

01:05.170 --> 01:11.740
With that being said slides are not all bad and I will use them to get a specific point across.

01:11.740 --> 01:17.740
You'll see more slides in the beginning of the course and less slides as the course moves along.

01:17.740 --> 01:23.290
If you'll start watching course from the very beginning please be prepared to switch focus points few

01:23.290 --> 01:30.030
times since I have to cover multiple things at the same time and they all code depend on one another.

01:30.040 --> 01:36.010
So for example we cannot work with age the amount without actually downloading the text enter and so

01:36.010 --> 01:36.730
on.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.850
Last but not least during the course I will show you.

01:39.850 --> 01:46.020
Useful external references but that is not because I'm lazy to talk about them myself.

01:46.150 --> 01:52.090
You see as a web developer you'll daily search for information whether you forgot something or how to

01:52.090 --> 01:53.050
do something.

01:53.110 --> 01:55.370
And by the way that is perfectly normal.

01:55.420 --> 02:01.060
Nobody expects you to remember everything or you will trying to learn something new and having best

02:01.060 --> 02:03.750
resources will save your time tremendously.

02:03.920 --> 02:07.330
OK let's learn some major damage on CSX shall we.
