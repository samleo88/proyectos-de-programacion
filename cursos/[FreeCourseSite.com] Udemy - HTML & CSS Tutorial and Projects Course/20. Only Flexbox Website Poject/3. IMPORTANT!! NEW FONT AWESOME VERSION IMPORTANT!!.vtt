00:00.060 --> 00:06.200
If you're following along with my project set up everything should be working fine.

00:06.480 --> 00:13.610
However there's no issue with a font awesome because the recordings were done with an old font awesome

00:13.930 --> 00:17.560
and now there is a new font or some more here version.

00:17.560 --> 00:18.080
All right.

00:18.150 --> 00:19.710
I'm talking about the icons right now.

00:19.710 --> 00:20.370
Right.

00:20.430 --> 00:27.010
So what's happening is that if you go here right to the font awesome website you don't have any more

00:27.120 --> 00:29.200
the layout that you saw before right.

00:29.220 --> 00:36.980
You actually have a version 5.0 6 and the old one actually is over here four point zero so right.

00:36.990 --> 00:42.880
So what's happening is that if you want to fall on the course exactly like the way I was working with

00:42.880 --> 00:49.650
the font are sometimes what you would need to do all here is once you are in the phone Tarsem go here

00:49.650 --> 00:51.240
to the old documentation.

00:51.290 --> 00:51.690
Right.

00:51.900 --> 00:58.690
And then the set up was exactly the same how I showed in a video right in the set up video.

00:58.710 --> 01:02.870
However you also have an option of working with a new font.

01:02.870 --> 01:03.930
Awesome right.

01:04.060 --> 01:10.530
And now I'm going to show you how to download a new font awesome version 5.0 6 right.

01:10.560 --> 01:13.140
And what would be the differences.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.060
So here again we do the same thing.

01:15.090 --> 01:22.050
We just do the download here and with me right to show you is when we have a getting started.

01:22.050 --> 01:22.560
Right.

01:22.830 --> 01:26.670
And the difference is that we are not using anymore a C Ss right.

01:26.880 --> 01:31.160
And again here again they're offering a phantasm free CDN.

01:31.410 --> 01:38.040
And as you said we're not using we we're going to be doning And right now and like I said indifferences

01:38.220 --> 01:43.330
they don't want to use the C Ss actually want you to use or hear the genius right.

01:43.470 --> 01:46.550
So let's go step by step how we would do this.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.460
So we're going to go back over here now and my downloads right.

01:50.670 --> 01:51.510
I have my font.

01:51.510 --> 01:52.180
Awesome.

01:52.310 --> 01:59.100
Right so I can just open all the zip code and once it's open all right what I would need to look for

01:59.250 --> 02:07.250
is a squeegee with us then a folder and not the brand Menges.

02:07.260 --> 02:12.490
That's not what I want and when I would need is with me because this guy or here now.

02:12.710 --> 02:13.450
All right.

02:13.740 --> 02:15.470
What I would need is this font.

02:15.480 --> 02:16.120
Awesome.

02:16.130 --> 02:17.410
All Yes.

02:17.430 --> 02:18.480
So what I'm going to do here.

02:18.510 --> 02:25.500
You can see that I have my font or some folder so on them and drag this file over here and actually

02:25.500 --> 02:33.430
place it in the folder if I'm going to be able to do it right over here I can close my downloads and

02:33.480 --> 02:40.410
or here we have index numbers going to create a simple indexation index page them or here we're going

02:40.410 --> 02:42.550
to place a skeleton.

02:42.780 --> 02:43.410
All right.

02:43.440 --> 02:50.640
A basic skeleton or likeness and because what we would want is just to see how it works.

02:50.690 --> 02:51.130
Right.

02:51.390 --> 02:57.080
So now when we have the age old let's check it out how we can actually add this awesome jazz.

02:57.240 --> 03:00.960
And what I'm getting this phantasm jazz right so you see or hear right.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.240
Like I was telling you this is what they want right.

03:03.300 --> 03:04.180
That's the file.

03:04.290 --> 03:05.160
They don't want any more.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.080
They found some Mincy SS which was with an older version.

03:08.130 --> 03:08.820
Right.

03:08.820 --> 03:12.090
So here you can see that we have GRABBE right.

03:12.090 --> 03:15.690
We got that then we need to reference it in a head.

03:15.720 --> 03:19.990
So basically they're saying or here find the fantastic amount yes.

03:19.990 --> 03:21.640
So what are we going to do here.

03:21.690 --> 03:28.370
We're going to write a script in the head press tab and for the source we're selling this right for

03:28.520 --> 03:28.910
us.

03:28.960 --> 03:35.340
Margie is here and maybe we can do English here right now.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.040
How do we create a phantasm like ours.

03:38.290 --> 03:45.780
So let's put them side by side here and let's go here and you see or hear how to use.

03:45.780 --> 03:46.390
Right.

03:46.830 --> 03:49.640
And the difference with an old one.

03:49.980 --> 03:53.420
You can see or hear did they have a little bit of difference in tax right.

03:53.670 --> 03:56.870
You see the style prefixes instead of f a.

03:56.970 --> 04:06.210
And all here whatever the font awesome I can write you have f a yes F R F L and F A B.

04:06.290 --> 04:06.730
Right.

04:06.870 --> 04:13.970
So again if you want to create more here you are icons exactly like in a project you need to go with

04:13.970 --> 04:17.760
an old one that you would need to go in and all documentation.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.770
However the differences are not that big.

04:21.100 --> 04:21.480
Right.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.440
So let's say in a project I'm going to be using a font or some like.

04:25.660 --> 04:28.490
So I'm going to say or here I f a.

04:28.590 --> 04:31.200
And I would be using F-8 home.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.200
Now we're here with a new one.

04:33.330 --> 04:37.240
You can see that syntax is actually going to be f a s.

04:37.260 --> 04:40.750
So what we're going to do here we're going to add one more class.

04:40.790 --> 04:45.450
Right so instead of FAA a home right we're going to have F S and FAA.

04:45.450 --> 04:46.250
All right.

04:46.350 --> 04:48.600
So that's pretty much going to be the difference.

04:48.600 --> 04:53.030
Now there's going to be cases we're all going to be using with a new one also.

04:53.050 --> 04:55.000
And then let's say FHB.

04:55.160 --> 04:55.580
Right.

04:55.740 --> 04:58.790
But the point is that the names are going to stay the same.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.970
So it's really up to you how do you want.

05:00.990 --> 05:01.600
Right.

05:01.650 --> 05:08.120
Whether you want to download the new one and just double check the icon name right here because if you

05:08.120 --> 05:14.100
go to icons write whatever icons are modding you can go ahead or double check them.

05:14.200 --> 05:21.210
Right now the new syntax will be or you can download the old one right and follow the course.

05:21.240 --> 05:23.310
Exactly how I'm typing the font.

05:23.310 --> 05:23.850
Awesome.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.270
Again this is really not a big deal.

05:26.320 --> 05:31.770
However it's something that I need to mention to you before you know is that something is not working

05:31.770 --> 05:36.680
right that you can download the icons that you can use the icons which you need to remember.

05:36.700 --> 05:43.080
And there's two versions right now of font awesome icons and the recordings were done with an old one

05:43.560 --> 05:49.450
which again you can find it on here but you can see how easy it is to actually use the new one.
