If you're anything like me it is a great struggle for you to pick Nice colors for your next project.

00:06.810 --> 00:12.230
And while there are many great options out there and all of them essentially do the same thing that

00:12.240 --> 00:14.430
is offer you a color palette.

00:14.430 --> 00:17.700
I'll show you coolers which I use the most.

00:17.700 --> 00:23.730
As always this is subjective so if you like some other resource no hard feelings and the way it works

00:23.820 --> 00:27.070
is we're gonna have to visit coolers dot com.

00:27.280 --> 00:31.930
And if you're looking at your URL This is just gonna be basically see.

00:32.130 --> 00:37.720
And then to always and then again l o r s and then we're looking for dots.

00:38.120 --> 00:42.090
Now the moment we visit the site we notice that we're getting this interface.

00:42.270 --> 00:44.340
And on the home screen we see this button.

00:44.340 --> 00:45.660
Start the generator.

00:45.690 --> 00:48.080
It's free so we can just click on it.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.640
Have no fear they're not going to charge you anything.

00:50.640 --> 00:54.980
Then this is gonna load up the generator and now we're getting the color palette.

00:54.990 --> 01:00.930
Now let's say it starts here with a black one and obviously you can see this greenish yellowish or whatever.

01:00.930 --> 01:06.720
Now you can pick all these colors or let's say you just some more so you'll have to press the spacebar

01:07.280 --> 01:09.990
and now it spits back another set of colors.

01:10.200 --> 01:15.000
And I can go endlessly here with the spacebar and you understand the idea that this is just gonna give

01:15.000 --> 01:18.080
us each and every time a new color palette.

01:18.090 --> 01:24.240
Now let's say if I like this green bluish color I can just click on it and notice it says here lock.

01:24.420 --> 01:26.170
And again we can test some more.

01:26.300 --> 01:29.060
And let's say this is going to give me the matching color.

01:29.070 --> 01:31.110
Now I think this is gonna match with this guy.

01:31.600 --> 01:36.660
Okay I can test some more colors again with the spacebar and I can go on and on and on.

01:36.720 --> 01:40.260
Now on the bottom right now we already know what are the hex colors.

01:40.260 --> 01:45.420
So we can just copy and paste this value and then we can head over back to our tech center and let's

01:45.420 --> 01:48.150
say for a color I'm gonna pick this guy.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.020
Notice that it doesn't come with the hex value actual hash tag.

01:52.090 --> 01:53.580
So I'm going to leave the hash tag.

01:53.670 --> 01:58.070
Once I delete the old color let me copy and paste it once we're gonna save it.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.250
Right now my color is gonna be this greenish.

02:00.470 --> 02:05.940
If we would like to let's say change our background to this guy the part of one I'm going to copy the

02:05.940 --> 02:07.580
value I'm going to head over.

02:07.580 --> 02:14.070
Back to text editor and let's say here for the background again with a hashtag we're just gonna add

02:14.070 --> 02:15.270
the background color.

02:15.300 --> 02:20.160
Now normally what you're can do is you're gonna get all these colors up here on top of the C assess

02:20.550 --> 02:22.110
and then organize later on.

02:22.110 --> 02:26.070
Learn how to use the C assist variables and how we are using them.

02:26.070 --> 02:30.090
Most likely you're not going to be jumping back and forth for each and every element and getting the

02:30.110 --> 02:35.940
colors but the main idea is if you'd like to pick some kind of nice colors that actually go together.

02:36.050 --> 02:38.690
You would be looking for some kind of external resource.

02:38.850 --> 02:42.180
And the one that I like to use is the colors that you.
