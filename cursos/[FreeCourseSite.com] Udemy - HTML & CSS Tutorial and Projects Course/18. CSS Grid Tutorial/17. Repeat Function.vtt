00:00.550 --> 00:05.030
Up until now all the time we wanted a repeating rally.

00:05.060 --> 00:09.730
Well that was one fracture and or hundred pixels or two hundred pixels doesn't matter.

00:09.730 --> 00:15.480
Anytime we had a repeating value we had to manually write it out.

00:15.580 --> 00:21.460
So let's say if we're gonna have 20 columns with each of them a one fraction well when all you guessed

00:21.460 --> 00:22.870
that we would have to type it out.

00:23.230 --> 00:30.320
However we also have a repeat function that can simplify a lot of things for us.

00:30.340 --> 00:35.490
Now what I'm gonna do right now is add over to all my cells lead them.

00:35.530 --> 00:36.680
I don't care about them.

00:36.800 --> 00:44.640
And now let's look at a scenario like I said where we're gonna have a four column layout with 100 pixels.

00:44.650 --> 00:50.050
Now please keep in mind with the repeat function we can use any values whether that is going to be fraction

00:50.050 --> 00:54.730
or pixels it doesn't matter but of course I'm not going to show you with each and every unit.

00:54.730 --> 01:00.970
Let's just imagine the scenario where we have a hundred pixels as our column and I can show you that

01:00.970 --> 01:07.540
yes we could technically manually have that but of course the point of this video is to show you a repeat

01:07.960 --> 01:08.770
function.

01:08.800 --> 01:14.040
Now within the repeat function first thing that we would like to say how many times is going to be repeated.

01:14.140 --> 01:20.990
So whether that's four five three thousand one I don't know million whatever.

01:21.230 --> 01:24.220
I'm going to go with four and then what kind of value would want.

01:24.640 --> 01:31.150
So if I had one one fraction I said I would just type on fraction since the example that I was technically

01:31.150 --> 01:32.710
giving you is under pixels.

01:32.900 --> 01:38.080
And then we're just going to set it up as hundred pixels and hopefully you get an idea where.

01:38.080 --> 01:43.840
Now when we repeating values and now I'm not talking about if we have a hundred pixels then two hundred

01:43.840 --> 01:45.430
pixels the 300 pixels.

01:45.480 --> 01:51.580
Now I'm done by repeating values so if I have some kind of repeating values which a lot of cases is

01:51.580 --> 01:54.510
going to be something like this Let's say one fraction.

01:54.640 --> 01:55.270
Correct.

01:55.330 --> 02:01.320
So then we can just type repeat then how many times it is going to be repeated and what kind of value

02:01.320 --> 02:02.670
is going to be repeated.

02:02.740 --> 02:08.130
And since now we are already experts how to use a repeat function must do the same thing with rows.

02:08.530 --> 02:12.510
So let's say two rows and hundred pixels.

02:12.520 --> 02:15.990
So then we can get rid of these suckers still.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.450
Let's say that.

02:17.470 --> 02:23.200
Now I do have arrows now if you want to see an action let's say 300.

02:23.230 --> 02:26.820
So now both my rows are in fact three pixels.

02:27.040 --> 02:32.530
And that's how we can use a repeat function when working with CSX grid.
