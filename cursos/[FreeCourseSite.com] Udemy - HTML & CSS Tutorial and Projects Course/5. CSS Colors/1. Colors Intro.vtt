Hey guys at this point I think we are comfortable with it says basics so we can start exploring more

00:06.000 --> 00:08.180
specific parts of CSX.

00:08.370 --> 00:14.230
And since we have used colors for most of our examples anyway why don't we start with colors and see.

00:14.760 --> 00:19.160
In the following videos we will look at color properties values.

00:19.170 --> 00:25.030
How Visual Studio code can help us out with picking the best colors possible for our project.

00:25.140 --> 00:31.590
And last but not least we'll explore useful external resources for colors in here says So what do you

00:31.590 --> 00:32.150
say.

00:32.160 --> 00:32.990
