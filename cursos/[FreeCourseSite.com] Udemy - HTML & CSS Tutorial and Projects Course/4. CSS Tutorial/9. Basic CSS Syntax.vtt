00:00.630 --> 00:01.250
Excellent.

00:01.260 --> 00:03.450
We know who is the biggest bully.

00:03.480 --> 00:05.350
That would be the inland sea assets.

00:05.430 --> 00:10.310
So let's right now look at the syntax and the way the general syntax works.

00:10.320 --> 00:14.800
Number four again we do this let me just delete this comment change the email.

00:15.210 --> 00:16.690
Let's get over the link.

00:16.770 --> 00:18.860
I think we can get rid of all these headings.

00:18.870 --> 00:21.200
We can just leave maybe two of them.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.780
So I'm just going to get rid of these ones.

00:23.850 --> 00:27.480
Delete the other having two as well.

00:27.480 --> 00:30.630
We can get this one deleted.

00:30.630 --> 00:37.860
So there's gonna be no inline style and just as a side note if you would like throughout your assistant

00:37.910 --> 00:41.040
Oriel you can work within the statute.

00:41.190 --> 00:42.230
The internal one.

00:42.390 --> 00:48.480
So let's say all the examples that I'm gonna be doing are gonna be in the external statute or if you

00:48.480 --> 00:51.560
do find it more useful during Desert Oriel.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.170
You can obviously work here within the internal one.

00:54.330 --> 00:59.070
So let's say it's a little bit more powerful to you to see that you're going to be selecting having

00:59.070 --> 01:04.900
one and you can see that the actual heading one is gonna be right in front of you in duration IMO.

01:04.950 --> 01:09.420
Now I wouldn't suggest doing that when we were gonna be working on the project because there's gonna

01:09.420 --> 01:15.840
be way more code in the actual success but for now there's not going to be that many so you might as

01:15.840 --> 01:16.940
well can do that.

01:16.950 --> 01:22.740
No I'm gonna write everything an external one because I just find it a little bit more interesting and

01:22.740 --> 01:27.850
useful for me when I have that external style sheet but this is really up to you.

01:27.870 --> 01:32.840
So if this is something you enjoy more working with internal one during the tutorial.

01:32.850 --> 01:35.230
Go ahead and just do that.

01:35.410 --> 01:39.600
Now I'm going to delete it and I'm gonna do all my work in the external.

01:39.630 --> 01:44.610
Now if we're going to head over to external one we're not gonna cover yet all the values.

01:45.240 --> 01:51.150
However we will gonna go over the general things that are there so first and foremost this is gonna

01:51.150 --> 01:52.540
be called C assessable.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.930
So this whole thing together is a C S as rule.

01:55.960 --> 02:00.880
Also if you are working in C Ss we have an option for comment.

02:01.320 --> 02:07.980
So the way create comments is just by command and a forward slash or again if you don't like the actual

02:07.980 --> 02:11.490
shortcuts we can head over to the file or you know what.

02:11.490 --> 02:17.010
It wasn't file I think it was in the edit notice we have toggle comment so that's gonna do the same

02:17.010 --> 02:22.050
thing and that's gonna be useful especially as we're working through the project because you would want

02:22.050 --> 02:23.520
to separate your styles.

02:23.970 --> 02:28.470
So there's gonna be some styles that are for some type of section of the page then there's gonna be

02:28.470 --> 02:29.220
other ones.

02:29.220 --> 02:31.260
So you will gonna use the comments.

02:31.260 --> 02:34.140
So just so you're not surprised at what's happening right now.

02:34.140 --> 02:37.330
If you'd like to add the comment again you just go here.

02:37.380 --> 02:41.790
Let me start a new line maybe that's going to be a little bit more useful and if you click on toggle

02:41.790 --> 02:44.470
line comment you'll gonna get new sets of comments.

02:44.640 --> 02:50.130
So everything that we're gonna write over here similarly how we have within the email is not gonna be

02:50.150 --> 02:51.250
infected nostalgic.

02:51.660 --> 02:55.970
So we can even comment out the actual styles that we have for now.

02:56.130 --> 03:01.110
So let's say I can come at the mouth once we say with notice we have no styles anymore.

03:01.120 --> 03:05.980
So it's also something that you might do later on when you would like to test something.

03:06.060 --> 03:11.670
So I digress a little bit but I wanted to show you just so you're not surprised of what's happening.

03:12.030 --> 03:15.110
So let me delete this come in here was getting rid of this one.

03:15.150 --> 03:19.950
The second one and here we're gonna say that this would be C assessable.

03:20.010 --> 03:22.650
Now next on our agenda is going to be this guy.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.530
So this is gonna be our selector again.

03:25.620 --> 03:27.590
Let me create the no comment.

03:27.710 --> 03:30.380
And let's write that we are looking for selector.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.760
Now there's gonna be tons of selectors.

03:32.910 --> 03:40.260
However in my opinion it's not necessary especially in the beginning to really know all of them because

03:40.260 --> 03:45.710
you can do a lot of powerful things by knowing I don't know maybe six or seven of them.

03:45.840 --> 03:51.630
And for most cases believe me you can do a lot of powerful things just by using the class selectors

03:51.630 --> 03:57.440
that we haven't covered and the I.D. So later on we're going to look at more selectors.

03:57.450 --> 04:01.780
But in general just remember that this is gonna be something that you're selecting.

04:01.920 --> 04:06.100
So let's say in our case we're selecting the heading One if there's gonna be heading to we're going

04:06.100 --> 04:10.920
to be selecting heading to if there's gonna be a class we're gonna be selecting class and so on and

04:10.920 --> 04:11.820
so forth.

04:11.850 --> 04:17.460
So this would be something that we're selecting with the selector after the selector we have the declaration

04:17.460 --> 04:17.700
look.

04:17.710 --> 04:21.000
So first of all let me write this the check.

04:21.030 --> 04:26.930
There are Asian that's gonna be probably proper spelling and this whole thing is gonna be declaration

04:26.950 --> 04:32.420
one hour notice that we do need to have the opening really brace and the closing.

04:32.850 --> 04:37.320
So again if you're going to admit this and if I'm gonna save this for now this is gonna work but it

04:37.320 --> 04:38.410
gives you an error.

04:38.490 --> 04:43.320
So technically if you're gonna do something like this if we're going to use another heading to notice

04:43.420 --> 04:44.680
it's gonna be really hard.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.500
You are getting right away there.

04:46.860 --> 04:48.500
So here we're gonna write colour red.

04:48.900 --> 04:49.560
Let's check it out.

04:49.560 --> 04:54.560
We're all going to have and we cannot select anymore our heading to because we already made here the

04:54.570 --> 04:55.170
syntax.

04:55.680 --> 05:00.460
So we need to be careful with the fact that you do need to follow the proper.

05:00.510 --> 05:05.500
So the moment I'm going to open up or I'm sorry had the closing curly brace then everything is gonna

05:05.520 --> 05:06.290
be working fine.

05:06.720 --> 05:10.330
Well this is gonna be our whole declaration blah now.

05:10.350 --> 05:14.190
Like I probably mentioned before and know that this is not what I would like to do.

05:14.430 --> 05:17.720
The whole thing is gonna be called C assess rule.

05:17.790 --> 05:19.850
So this is gonna be our whole.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.020
That includes the selection or and the declaration.

05:23.520 --> 05:29.030
Now you don't need to remember these names but the reason why I'm telling you this is as we're gonna

05:29.040 --> 05:34.560
be going through tutorial just so you're not surprised if I'm using one of them if I let's say well

05:34.590 --> 05:41.070
let's work on the most basic selector you know what I'm talking about now this within is gonna be the

05:41.070 --> 05:47.870
property so let's say within the declaration block there's gonna be a declaration now declaration is

05:47.870 --> 05:50.300
the property lost the value.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.710
So in our case this would be this mine.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.580
Let's write over here declaration.

05:55.590 --> 05:56.600
That's going to be the naming.

05:56.900 --> 06:00.720
And then within a declaration this guy's gonna be the property.

06:00.740 --> 06:02.480
So what kind of property would we want.

06:02.870 --> 06:08.600
Whether this is gonna be the color or font size and again there's many many properties.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.330
So I just am not going to cover them right now.

06:11.330 --> 06:14.810
But in general what you need to remember this is going to be the property.

06:14.810 --> 06:17.300
Then we have the syntax of a colon.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.290
And then here we have the values.

06:19.580 --> 06:24.450
And if we have many properties we also have even more value.

06:24.530 --> 06:30.320
So let's say four colors again you name it you want blue you will get blue you want red you'll get red

06:30.710 --> 06:32.140
and you get the idea.

06:32.390 --> 06:38.780
Now like I also mentioned before the semicolon is important because if I'm going to admit the semicolon

06:38.900 --> 06:41.930
and again if we're gonna save it notice something interesting.

06:41.930 --> 06:45.160
My color blue is not working as well as my font size.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.230
Again we're getting the errors right away.

06:47.390 --> 06:53.060
So it's kind of hard to miss and this is one of the neat things of using the actual nice text header

06:53.600 --> 06:59.930
which is gonna give you right away suggestions so you don't have to spend hours or minutes or whatever

07:00.320 --> 07:03.470
on looking for the user syntax errors that you created.

07:03.680 --> 07:07.770
Because believe me again we have four lines of code seven lines of code.

07:07.790 --> 07:09.300
Yeah of course it's easy.

07:09.440 --> 07:16.430
But once you get to hundreds and thousands then the smaller might take you a long long to fix it and

07:16.430 --> 07:16.820
find it.

07:17.150 --> 07:21.890
So it's always better if you have something visually telling you that Hey listen buddy you've made some

07:21.890 --> 07:22.550
kind of mistake.

07:22.940 --> 07:25.630
So semicolons important in short.

07:26.120 --> 07:29.580
So let me maybe add more here that there's going to be property.

07:29.810 --> 07:34.090
So let's write property and write up the property we have the value.

07:34.230 --> 07:34.910
Let me say it.

07:34.910 --> 07:36.620
Now we have our comments.

07:36.620 --> 07:43.730
So now we know the basic syntax and again in a nutshell all these things are gonna change depending

07:43.730 --> 07:44.870
on what you're doing.

07:44.990 --> 07:49.040
You're gonna have different selectors you're going to have different properties and you're going to

07:49.040 --> 07:50.420
have different values.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.420
So these things are gonna be constantly changing.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.400
You're not always gonna work with having once.

07:55.400 --> 07:59.870
You're not always gonna work with just others or let's say color value of blue.

07:59.870 --> 08:02.310
So all things can change all the time.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.130
However the syntax is gonna stay the same.

08:05.180 --> 08:09.740
You will gonna have a selector you all gonna have a property and you will gonna have value.
