00:00.330 --> 00:01.150
All right guys.

00:01.170 --> 00:08.450
Tutorial is nice but you know what is better apply our Flex box knowledge to build a product.

00:08.520 --> 00:10.640
So what are we going to build.

00:10.650 --> 00:18.780
My project is going to be a one page Web site for a global tour company called backroads and for layout

00:19.020 --> 00:20.370
essentially positioning.

00:20.550 --> 00:26.450
We are going to use flex bucks so let's cover in more detail our project.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.580
First and foremost we are going to build a network.

00:29.910 --> 00:34.760
And I also would like to point that out that our project is going to be responsive.

00:34.860 --> 00:40.560
So as you can see we're going to have a one layout for the smaller screen size as far as nav bar is

00:40.560 --> 00:41.180
concerned.

00:41.340 --> 00:43.960
And as far as other sections as well.

00:44.100 --> 00:50.270
But then as the screen size is going to change while our layout also is going to change.

00:50.310 --> 00:55.320
So in some cases we're going to have a three column layout in some cases we're going to have a two column

00:55.320 --> 00:55.650
land.

00:56.010 --> 01:03.060
But since I find it useless for me for each and every section to go to a smaller screen test to show

01:03.060 --> 01:05.670
that I'm just letting you know that right away.

01:05.700 --> 01:13.600
So each and every element and section we're going to create is going to look good on every screen size.

01:13.630 --> 01:18.140
All right now like I said First we're going to start with a now.

01:18.270 --> 01:23.640
And also as a side note we're going to have some javascript that I'm gonna show you a little bit later

01:23.970 --> 01:31.410
at the end of the intro video but there's going to be a number that on the small screen says looks like

01:31.410 --> 01:38.130
this where we have the links and then using the Flex box once we get to a bigger screen size we're gonna

01:38.160 --> 01:43.550
have a role layout with justify content in between.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.500
Meaning justify content and space between.

01:46.500 --> 01:52.340
So as you see we have right now our logo then the links are in the middle and then all the way on the

01:52.340 --> 01:53.370
right hand side.

01:53.370 --> 01:59.490
We're going to have our fourth awesome icons like I said I'm going to come back to a number later on.

01:59.490 --> 02:02.270
Just show you the functionality we're gonna have.

02:02.310 --> 02:03.710
Also using JavaScript.

02:04.080 --> 02:11.040
But next after the number we're going to create a hero element and then within the hero element we're

02:11.040 --> 02:18.720
going to have a massive background image with some linear gradient and as well using the Flex box we're

02:18.720 --> 02:27.430
gonna place our banner so to text as well as the button in the center horizontally as well as vertically.

02:27.480 --> 02:34.560
Then after that we're going to have the about section where we're going to implement flex box to in

02:34.560 --> 02:36.330
fact create a two column layout.

02:36.690 --> 02:43.070
So we're going to have some kind of title here than the image as well as the before selector.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.010
So we're going to create this element.

02:46.020 --> 02:52.710
Actually this type of functionality using the pseudo selector and then on the right hand side we're

02:52.710 --> 02:56.980
going to have more title some more text as well as the link.

02:57.030 --> 03:03.780
And like I said I'm not going to show you that for each and every section we're going to in fact cover

03:04.200 --> 03:09.690
but I just want to let you know that on a small screen size we're gonna have a one column layout.

03:10.050 --> 03:12.540
So when the image is sitting on the top.

03:12.960 --> 03:17.850
And then once we get to a certain screen size well then we're gonna have a two column.

03:18.280 --> 03:24.540
Now that would be about a section then we're going to have these services section we had the services

03:24.540 --> 03:26.320
that company provides.

03:26.410 --> 03:33.030
And in here we're not only going to implement the Flex box layout in order to set up the columns we're

03:33.030 --> 03:35.630
also going to implement it within the column.

03:35.640 --> 03:42.680
So not only these columns are going to be a flex box children for one main element they're also going

03:42.680 --> 03:45.030
to be a flex box parent themselves.

03:45.210 --> 03:49.620
Or notice we're going to have the icon as well as the text side by side.

03:49.890 --> 03:52.480
And then we're going to have a feature towards.

03:52.500 --> 03:56.600
So let's imagine some kind of towards that company provides.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.130
And as you can see we have build out the cards.

03:59.130 --> 04:06.880
And again we are using flex box not only to set up in fact our columns but also within the card itself.

04:07.240 --> 04:14.790
Then after the feature tours section we're going to create a gallery section where we're going to implement

04:14.790 --> 04:21.550
the Flex box to have this tile layout where we're going to have a bunch of images and they're just gonna

04:21.570 --> 04:25.900
be displayed depending on the screen size with certain column layout.

04:25.940 --> 04:30.960
Now also within the actual item there's going to be a icon.

04:30.960 --> 04:37.200
So as we're hovering over the item where the image is sitting we're going to have this icon showing

04:37.200 --> 04:37.820
up as well.

04:38.040 --> 04:44.100
So that is the effect that we're going to create then we're going to have the heart deal section and

04:44.100 --> 04:50.880
then within this particular section we're going to implement flex box to create this nice layout where

04:51.060 --> 04:55.810
we're going to have the form input as well as the submit button together.

04:55.860 --> 05:00.930
So we're going to implement flex box in order to create that and then all the way bottom we're going

05:00.930 --> 05:08.160
to have the footer with the links as well as the social media icons and for both of these guys we're

05:08.160 --> 05:10.580
going to implement Luxe Box as well.

05:10.770 --> 05:15.150
Not like promised I would like to show the functionality that we're going to add.

05:15.150 --> 05:17.750
Now I do want to let you know that this is optional.

05:17.790 --> 05:21.070
So first of all I'm gonna prepare the code for you.

05:21.270 --> 05:24.650
So you're not going to have to understand javascript to do it.

05:24.720 --> 05:29.130
You can just add the code and you're gonna be good to go as well as it is.

05:29.130 --> 05:30.390
At the end of the project.

05:30.480 --> 05:35.970
So technically it is optional meaning you're still gonna have the working project even if you don't

05:35.970 --> 05:37.870
want to bother with JavaScript.

05:37.890 --> 05:43.830
Now as far as justice is concerned first and foremost all the way to the bottom we're going to have

05:43.830 --> 05:44.830
this date.

05:44.910 --> 05:53.100
So we're going to set up the year dynamically then are in fact Navarre is also going to have the position

05:53.100 --> 05:57.440
fixed once we get below certain height in our document.

05:57.760 --> 06:04.110
So notice as we start scrolling only then nav bar is going to have this position fixed.

06:04.110 --> 06:09.450
And as you can see it's going to be positioned all the way in the top and then we're also going to implement

06:09.450 --> 06:10.850
these smooth scrolling.

06:10.890 --> 06:17.730
So if I click on one of the links were nicely again in fact smooth scroll to that particular section.

06:17.730 --> 06:23.790
So whether that's featured services about and we can go all the way back home as well.

06:23.790 --> 06:30.840
Now lastly I would like to show that we are also going to implement javascript to have our NAV bar have

06:30.900 --> 06:32.060
a toggle button.

06:32.160 --> 06:38.370
So on a smaller screen size there's gonna be only the nav bar header and then within the header we're

06:38.370 --> 06:40.400
going to have this toggle button.

06:40.470 --> 06:44.680
So once we click on it nowadays of course we can toggle out our links.

06:44.910 --> 06:50.790
And again we're going to implement the same functionality where even on a smaller screen size I could

06:50.790 --> 06:55.170
navigate to my particular section as much as I would like.

06:55.170 --> 06:55.830
All right.

06:55.830 --> 07:01.230
Now that is the project that we're going to be building guys hopefully guys you enjoy the project and

07:01.230 --> 07:05.160
let's start working on our backroads to our company project.
