WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:00.230
No.

00:00.380 --> 00:00.960
OK.

00:01.020 --> 00:02.420
This looks very good.

00:02.430 --> 00:04.700
But probably that is not the look that we want.

00:04.700 --> 00:08.050
So why don't we head over back to this saves us what's right.

00:08.060 --> 00:08.580
Contact.

00:08.580 --> 00:13.280
So we're going to be working on this section copying pasted let's say end of contact.

00:13.690 --> 00:18.150
Now let's start working with these parts first and foremost I would just want to work with the contact

00:18.150 --> 00:20.810
section and that little bit of padding on our bottom.

00:21.030 --> 00:23.490
So we're going to say purring or you know it's.

00:23.510 --> 00:26.670
Padding on the top adding on top.

00:26.680 --> 00:27.700
So where are you.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.030
Right here.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.420
This is gonna be to our.

00:30.560 --> 00:31.980
A little bit of more padding.

00:32.040 --> 00:37.120
Then we also would want to start working with this contact item and I would want to add some margin

00:37.120 --> 00:37.790
in between them.

00:38.340 --> 00:45.650
So well first of all gonna have to select the class of contact item that was our class and then let's

00:45.640 --> 00:48.240
write Ma Jun bottom where are you.

00:48.720 --> 00:48.950
Here.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.480
Let's do like three areas.

00:50.670 --> 00:56.470
So now between each and every item that I have the contact item I will gonna have the margin.

00:56.700 --> 01:02.280
I also would like to start working with contact title so this is something that's gonna be interesting

01:02.280 --> 01:03.820
because we're gonna be styling.

01:04.110 --> 01:07.740
So going to say color first of all and the color is gonna be the primary.

01:07.740 --> 01:10.770
Now in this case this should turn green.

01:10.980 --> 01:13.350
And sure enough it does what else I would like.

01:13.410 --> 01:21.510
Well we can do font family on family is gonna be to the slanted text so let's write where or let's find

01:21.510 --> 01:24.670
this bad boy and this is gonna be our slanted text.

01:24.670 --> 01:26.650
Now the actress is gonna look like this.

01:26.670 --> 01:33.480
We can also add maybe text transform uppercase uppercase and I keep on adding all the time these quotation

01:33.480 --> 01:39.120
marks and that's probably I'm still getting used to my new keyboard but it takes me a long time.

01:39.570 --> 01:46.380
Oh it's also the letter spacing I would like to right now show you what's really nifty about the calc

01:46.380 --> 01:51.420
function if you remember when we covered it as well as how we can use the variables.

01:51.600 --> 01:58.320
So the calc function allowed us to do the mathematical operations and in our case we would want to say

01:58.350 --> 01:58.630
okay.

01:58.650 --> 02:02.380
So we have a spacing and for this we do have our variable.

02:02.460 --> 02:04.170
So we had letter spacing zero point four.

02:04.860 --> 02:11.100
But what if I would want to have the bigger letter spacing but not only bigger I would want to say let's

02:11.100 --> 02:14.430
say twice as big as my normal variable.

02:14.430 --> 02:18.000
So what I can do is I can pass the variable within this column function.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.180
Well I'm going to be looking for a letter spacing and then we can create a magical operation.

02:23.190 --> 02:27.840
So what I'm saying right now is make the letter spacing but make it double the size.

02:27.840 --> 02:33.710
So that's also something really nifty whatever you need to use the caulk function remember that if you're

02:33.720 --> 02:39.450
using developed variables you can do nice math operations with what else I would like.

02:39.450 --> 02:45.160
Well we can also do probably font size bigger font size.

02:45.180 --> 02:46.230
I don't know.

02:46.230 --> 02:54.660
One point six something like this one font size ramps bigger and margin bottom is gonna be I don't know

02:54.660 --> 03:01.920
zero point five I think that should do zero point five our AMS is gonna be our margin bottom are what

03:01.920 --> 03:09.830
else we have where we have the contact text so contact text there's gonna be our next target.

03:10.290 --> 03:17.220
And for this guy this is gonna be very actually simple text transform not emphasis Style Text transform

03:17.220 --> 03:18.260
is gonna be uppercase.

03:18.300 --> 03:23.700
So this is how we're gonna be working with this guy and then we're gonna be starting to work with portion

03:23.700 --> 03:24.630
control.

03:24.630 --> 03:26.270
Now what was the font control.

03:26.280 --> 03:31.740
Well the form control was each and every input that will work and the way we're gonna start styled this

03:31.740 --> 03:38.610
guy is going to be form control also in selecting this class right now and what kind of styles would

03:38.610 --> 03:40.580
like first of all wanted displayed.

03:40.580 --> 03:47.870
BLOCK Because at the moment it is displayed in line because all of them are one by one side by side.

03:48.020 --> 03:53.970
So we're not in line but I would want them to be blocked so now they're spanning all across.

03:53.970 --> 03:59.070
And what I'm seeing here is that there is going to be some kind of mistake already or you know I'm not

03:59.070 --> 03:59.510
mistake.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.120
I just need to add the.

04:01.290 --> 04:04.070
So let's say here that the width is going to be a hundred percent.

04:04.290 --> 04:08.800
And I'm just gonna make sure that all of them are working and I can see that the email is not correct.

04:09.150 --> 04:15.630
And the way that I can see that not only email is not correct but actually the name also is the fact

04:15.630 --> 04:17.080
that I missed out here.

04:17.100 --> 04:21.660
So control and I was in control and now this should work.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.970
So now all of them are displayed block and the with us in person.

04:26.820 --> 04:30.350
And then I would like to get rid of the border so.

04:30.390 --> 04:30.680
All right.

04:30.680 --> 04:37.980
Border is gonna be known in case but later on we're gonna have the border in the bottom because if we're

04:37.980 --> 04:43.170
looking at the finished project this is gonna be obviously what we're having right now but we see or

04:43.170 --> 04:48.360
hear that we we're going to have the bar in the bottom so that's gonna be our next challenge of doing

04:48.360 --> 04:50.540
border bottom.

04:50.590 --> 04:54.720
And let's say two pixels solid.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.280
So that type of border with a primary color.

04:58.320 --> 05:02.770
So let's read primary color and this will gonna be our border master.

05:03.420 --> 05:06.930
We also have the outline now whereas the outline coming in.

05:07.100 --> 05:10.780
So let's say if I'm gonna go back to the project that we currently working.

05:10.950 --> 05:13.470
And if you click on it notice you have this blue line.

05:13.980 --> 05:21.030
So if you want to get rid of it you just need to write outline and we're gonna set this equal to none.

05:21.120 --> 05:26.700
Also what the margin margins then we too are aims top bottom and zero left and right.

05:27.120 --> 05:34.230
So we're just going to add a little bit of margin then we can do padding one point three arms and zero

05:34.260 --> 05:38.820
again left and right there's gonna be no padding and then top and bottom there's gonna be one point

05:38.820 --> 05:39.790
three.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.240
We have also font size and you know what.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.620
Let's make this a little bit smaller.

05:44.900 --> 05:51.710
You can do like zero point five zero point eight five arms.

05:51.810 --> 05:58.770
That's gonna be our fun size and we can maybe add also the font weight onto it is gonna people now as

05:58.770 --> 06:03.720
you're looking at it you're probably thinking that we're styling this and that is true some of styles

06:03.720 --> 06:07.410
are being applied right now to the place holder that we're having here.

06:07.740 --> 06:11.490
However the moment I'm gonna start dialing not as the this is gonna be text that we're actually going

06:11.490 --> 06:12.430
to be typing.

06:12.630 --> 06:16.700
Now what I would like to do is style this place holder a little bit different than the text that I'm

06:16.710 --> 06:20.360
going to be typing so I'm gonna type it here just so you can see what will be a difference.

06:20.370 --> 06:27.600
So this is gonna be the text we're gonna be typing but we do have the selector sudo selector port of

06:27.600 --> 06:33.820
place holder so we can say one control since this is gonna be in the class and then we can write placeholder.

06:33.870 --> 06:39.420
Now what I would like to style in the place holder first of all the color and let's do primary color

06:40.200 --> 06:43.960
primary color then we're gonna be text transforming.

06:44.220 --> 06:50.200
So we're gonna see a text transform and we would like to transform and uppercase and letter spacing.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.200
Let's do another letter spacing.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.270
But in this case we're not going to do any caulk function or anything.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.100
We're just gonna do the letter spacing.

06:57.150 --> 07:02.010
So in this case I'm working with just a place holder because my text is not changing.

07:02.070 --> 07:03.320
Don't believe me.

07:03.450 --> 07:09.300
I'm going to start typing and you notice this is gonna be my text and that is gonna be a place holder.

07:09.300 --> 07:10.600
Awesome.

07:10.650 --> 07:18.300
Last thing probably what we would want is to set up the relevant layout meaning responsive layout as

07:18.300 --> 07:26.180
we're changing the screen size so for the second we're gonna use the media query media screen and and

07:26.190 --> 07:33.590
I mean with you know what I saw this one needs to be in parentheses with and here let's say like this.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.730
Let's say that starting from nine hundred ninety two.

07:36.740 --> 07:43.280
So the moment we get to nine hundred ninety two I would like both of them to be 50 percent as well as

07:43.280 --> 07:49.100
I would like to add a little bit of padding because I obviously don't want them to be smushed together

07:49.490 --> 07:54.410
as you know what's happening is we're not adding any padding then they're all gonna be literally side

07:54.410 --> 07:55.060
by side.

07:55.190 --> 08:01.160
So I'm gonna say contact info then also I'm gonna make a comma and contact form.

08:01.310 --> 08:06.720
So those two columns that we had then we're gonna say what we would want to style them.

08:06.830 --> 08:13.760
Well we're gonna say float float is gonna be to the left as well as the width is gonna be 50 percent

08:14.240 --> 08:17.010
but we do want to add a little bit of panic.

08:17.150 --> 08:20.640
Now I don't want any padding here top bottom.

08:20.690 --> 08:22.250
I just want left and right.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.790
That is how this is gonna work.

08:24.080 --> 08:27.160
So if I'm gonna go to the finished project known as this is what's gonna happen.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.350
So at the moment we're gonna get to nine hundred ninety two.

08:30.350 --> 08:35.670
Then we're gonna have to column layer before that they're just gonna be stacked one on top of each other.

08:35.720 --> 08:41.030
So that would be my address and then this is how we can contact the actual T station.

08:41.210 --> 08:46.460
And then once I set them side by side this is all taken we can add a little bit of padding here for

08:46.460 --> 08:50.330
the contact info because I would like to push it down a little bit.

08:50.330 --> 08:57.260
So I'm gonna say contact info so separately uh here we're gonna be looking for the pairing of let's

08:57.260 --> 09:01.890
say top and we can go with I don't know far five areas.

09:02.270 --> 09:07.160
Once we say it then this is going to look a little bit more presentable and yeah this is how we can

09:07.160 --> 09:09.640
work with contact action style.

09:09.890 --> 09:12.920
RH The amount and now we have nice looking Contact section.
