00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,979
Hey guys, I just recorded this video and

2

00:00:01,979  -->  00:00:05,910
it was like 28 minutes, and then I

3

00:00:05,910  -->  00:00:07,859
accidentally deleted it without saving

4

00:00:07,859  -->  00:00:10,980
it. So, at least this time around I should

5

00:00:10,980  -->  00:00:12,990
be able to make it quite a bit shorter

6

00:00:12,990  -->  00:00:15,089
because i had a problem last time it was

7

00:00:15,089  -->  00:00:18,570
really, really stupid problem, but you

8

00:00:18,570  -->  00:00:21,779
guys won't see it, so that's neat. Alright, so, at this

9

00:00:21,779  -->  00:00:24,779
point we have our application created,

10

00:00:24,779  -->  00:00:27,689
and we have tabs created that we're able

11

00:00:27,689  -->  00:00:30,090
to move around, and we've got an address

12

00:00:30,090  -->  00:00:33,780
bar, but nothing does anything yet. So in

13

00:00:33,780  -->  00:00:36,149
this video what I'm going to do is get a

14

00:00:36,149  -->  00:00:39,030
stacked layout loaded in here, and get

15

00:00:39,030  -->  00:00:43,020
web engine loaded. So, we need to talk

16

00:00:43,020  -->  00:00:47,370
about the stacked layout a little more. When,

17

00:00:47,370  -->  00:00:55,379
where is that? Stacked layout, it's not there.

18

00:00:55,379  -->  00:00:58,980
Alright, so, I have not created it yet. So

19

00:00:58,980  -->  00:01:01,079
what we need to do is we need to create

20

00:01:01,079  -->  00:01:03,120
that, and how we're going to do that is

21

00:01:03,120  -->  00:01:09,000
we're going to drop down

22

00:01:09,000  -->  00:01:11,220
here a few lines and we are going to say set

23

00:01:11,220  -->  00:01:15,000
main view, and down here we're going to

24

00:01:15,000  -->  00:01:19,020
say self.container = QWidget,

25

00:01:19,020  -->  00:01:21,689
and this is going to be added after the

26

00:01:21,689  -->  00:01:23,850
toolbar. So you've got the tab bar, and you've got the

27

00:01:23,850  -->  00:01:26,280
toolbar, and then you'll have this widget

28

00:01:26,280  -->  00:01:27,960
which is going to have the stacked

29

00:01:27,960  -->  00:01:31,350
layout inside of it. So container.

30

00:01:31,350  -->  00:01:38,159
layout = QStackedLayout. Now we

31

00:01:38,159  -->  00:01:40,740
need to set the containers layout to the

32

00:01:40,740  -->  00:01:44,250
event handler, so self.container.

33

00:01:44,250  -->  00:01:48,090
setLayout equals

34

00:01:48,090  -->  00:01:50,850
self.container.layout. So, again we're

35

00:01:50,850  -->  00:01:52,799
just telling this widget to use the

36

00:01:52,799  -->  00:01:57,240
QStackedLayout. So when I save and

37

00:01:57,240  -->  00:01:59,820
run the application, nothing happens

38

00:01:59,820  -->  00:02:01,200
because we haven't actually added it to

39

00:02:01,200  -->  00:02:03,060
the main window yet. So let's go ahead

40

00:02:03,060  -->  00:02:06,810
and say self.layout.addWidget, and

41

00:02:06,810  -->  00:02:09,179
we're going to add self.container.

42

00:02:09,179  -->  00:02:11,160
Now this is being added after the

43

00:02:11,160  -->  00:02:11,850
toolbar,

44

00:02:11,850  -->  00:02:13,140
so it's under it because we're using

45

00:02:13,140  -->  00:02:15,150
a vertical box, and as you can see that cleared

46

00:02:15,150  -->  00:02:17,610
up a lot of spacing issues right now. So

47

00:02:17,610  -->  00:02:19,140
you can see that it works but you can't

48

00:02:19,140  -->  00:02:21,450
really see the stacked layout because we

49

00:02:21,450  -->  00:02:22,920
actually didn't put anything in there

50

00:02:22,920  -->  00:02:24,780
yet, and so that's what we're going to get

51

00:02:24,780  -->  00:02:28,800
to now. We need an ad tab button and we

52

00:02:28,800  -->  00:02:32,970
need to add that to the toolbar. So,

53

00:02:32,970  -->  00:02:38,070
New tab button, so we're going to say

54

00:02:38,070  -->  00:02:43,170
self.AddTabButton = QPushButton,

55

00:02:43,170  -->  00:02:45,630
and it's going to just have a plus sign

56

00:02:45,630  -->  00:02:47,730
for now. We are going to go through

57

00:02:47,730  -->  00:02:50,460
here and put icons in here on the

58

00:02:50,460  -->  00:02:52,110
toolbar buttons, but for right now we're

59

00:02:52,110  -->  00:02:53,850
going to use plain text just because it's

60

00:02:53,850  -->  00:02:55,860
easier, and then i'll show you how to set

61

00:02:55,860  -->  00:03:00,240
icons and load icons at a later point. Now what

62

00:03:00,240  -->  00:03:03,720
we need to do is connect AddTabButton.

63

00:03:03,720  -->  00:03:06,900
clicked.connect and we need to

64

00:03:06,900  -->  00:03:09,240
point it to the method that's actually

65

00:03:09,240  -->  00:03:11,940
going to add tabs, and so that is going

66

00:03:11,940  -->  00:03:17,400
to be called AddTab, which we're going to

67

00:03:17,400  -->  00:03:19,980
have to create. So for now let's just create that

68

00:03:19,980  -->  00:03:25,170
just to have it created, and we're just going to

69

00:03:25,170  -->  00:03:29,700
pass. Now we need to add that into the

70

00:03:29,700  -->  00:03:35,010
tool bar itself, so self.ToolbarLayout.

71

00:03:35,010  -->  00:03:41,400
addWidget, and I'm going to add

72

00:03:41,400  -->  00:03:45,240
self.AddTabButton. I'm going to save

73

00:03:45,240  -->  00:03:48,870
this, run the app again, now you're going

74

00:03:48,870  -->  00:03:50,730
to see there's a new tab button but it

75

00:03:50,730  -->  00:03:52,260
doesn't do anything yet, so let's make

76

00:03:52,260  -->  00:03:54,090
it do stuff.

77

00:03:54,090  -->  00:03:56,640
Let's go ahead and delete the tabs that

78

00:03:56,640  -->  00:03:58,260
we've got created right now just because

79

00:03:58,260  -->  00:04:00,180
we're not going to need them,

80

00:04:00,180  -->  00:04:02,400
we're going to be are calling AddTab

81

00:04:02,400  -->  00:04:06,420
immediately so there is always a tab

82

00:04:06,420  -->  00:04:09,510
active. Now we need to create a few

83

00:04:09,510  -->  00:04:13,290
variables, and let's create them right

84

00:04:13,290  -->  00:04:16,430
here. So,

85

00:04:17,310  -->  00:04:21,720
it's for keeping track of the tabs and

86

00:04:21,720  -->  00:04:23,610
the corresponding tab content, because

87

00:04:23,610  -->  00:04:26,550
they're separate object. So, self.

88

00:04:26,550  -->  00:04:32,669
tabCount = 0, and then we're going

89

00:04:32,669  -->  00:04:34,500
to increase that each time a tab is

90

00:04:34,500  -->  00:04:36,570
created and then use the tab count

91

00:04:36,570  -->  00:04:38,970
within the object name, and we haven't

92

00:04:38,970  -->  00:04:40,650
talked to the object names yet so that

93

00:04:40,650  -->  00:04:42,840
is going to be fun. And then we need a

94

00:04:42,840  -->  00:04:45,960
second variable called self.tabs, and

95

00:04:45,960  -->  00:04:48,810
that is going to contain not the tabs

96

00:04:48,810  -->  00:04:51,990
themselves but every widget that belongs

97

00:04:51,990  -->  00:04:53,820
to a tab.

98

00:04:53,820  -->  00:04:56,700
So the tab objects not the tab in the

99

00:04:56,700  -->  00:05:01,710
tab bar. So, when we add a tab the first

100

00:05:01,710  -->  00:05:05,070
thing we need to do is get the tab count,

101

00:05:05,070  -->  00:05:09,960
so self.i equals self, not self.i,

102

00:05:09,960  -->  00:05:17,070
i = self.tabCount. And then we need

103

00:05:17,070  -->  00:05:20,130
to start adding stuff to the self.

104

00:05:20,130  -->  00:05:23,970
tabsList. Now how we're going to do this

105

00:05:23,970  -->  00:05:27,150
is we're going to append a QWidget to it,

106

00:05:27,150  -->  00:05:31,800
and then use this index number

107

00:05:31,800  -->  00:05:35,729
to access that widget. So, self.tabs.

108

00:05:35,729  -->  00:05:41,310
append(QWidget( )), just like that. Now we can

109

00:05:41,310  -->  00:05:43,860
modify that widget itself by calling

110

00:05:43,860  -->  00:05:47,400
self.tabs[i], and then this is

111

00:05:47,400  -->  00:05:49,229
going to access that QWidget, so we

112

00:05:49,229  -->  00:05:52,020
can treat this little bit of code here

113

00:05:52,020  -->  00:05:54,210
the same as a QWidget because it's

114

00:05:54,210  -->  00:05:57,090
targeting a QWidget. So we're going to

115

00:05:57,090  -->  00:06:01,229
set layout first, and that's going to be

116

00:06:01,229  -->  00:06:06,780
equal to QVBoxLayout. And then we're

117

00:06:06,780  -->  00:06:09,570
going to set the object name and I'm

118

00:06:09,570  -->  00:06:11,580
going to demonstrate why it's important,

119

00:06:11,580  -->  00:06:14,490
but i'll demonstrate that later. So, self.

120

00:06:14,490  -->  00:06:17,340
tabs, and the tab we just

121

00:06:17,340  -->  00:06:19,979
created, the QWidget that we just created,

122

00:06:19,979  -->  00:06:23,460
we're going to set object name and we're

123

00:06:23,460  -->  00:06:25,470
going to set it to "tab"

124

00:06:25,470  -->  00:06:28,650
+ i,

125

00:06:28,650  -->  00:06:31,650
and we actually need to convert that

126

00:06:31,650  -->  00:06:36,990
to a string before we use it. Now we're

127

00:06:36,990  -->  00:06:40,320
going to create an attribute for the

128

00:06:40,320  -->  00:06:44,340
QWidget called content, and the

129

00:06:44,340  -->  00:06:47,639
content is going to be the QWebEngine. So

130

00:06:47,639  -->  00:06:49,259
before we even do that we need to now

131

00:06:49,259  -->  00:06:53,910
import WebEngine. So from

132

00:06:53,910  -->  00:06:59,070
PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import everything,

133

00:06:59,070  -->  00:07:02,430
and then we're going to scroll back down

134

00:07:02,430  -->  00:07:05,310
to our add tab method here, and we are

135

00:07:05,310  -->  00:07:08,490
going to create the web engine view

136

00:07:08,490  -->  00:07:12,360
which is the actual object that the

137

00:07:12,360  -->  00:07:14,610
page is going to be loaded into, and its

138

00:07:14,610  -->  00:07:16,199
really simple to do. So let's just go

139

00:07:16,199  -->  00:07:19,979
ahead and write self.tabs current

140

00:07:19,979  -->  00:07:26,400
tab content equals QWebEngineView,

141

00:07:26,400  -->  00:07:28,800
and that's an object so open a parenthesis.

142

00:07:28,800  -->  00:07:32,430
And then we're going to load google

143

00:07:32,430  -->  00:07:37,169
immediately into this view. self.tabs[i].

144

00:07:37,169  -->  00:07:41,550
content.load, we need to create a

145

00:07:41,550  -->  00:07:49,620
QUrl.fromUserInput, and then just type

146

00:07:49,620  -->  00:07:57,150
"http://google.com" So, QUrls

147

00:07:57,150  -->  00:08:00,810
you're able to run this method on it

148

00:08:00,810  -->  00:08:03,419
as soon as you declare it here,

149

00:08:03,419  -->  00:08:07,650
this method is going to convert text

150

00:08:07,650  -->  00:08:11,970
into an actual QUrl that Qt can

151

00:08:11,970  -->  00:08:15,810
then use to do stuff, and now we need to add

152

00:08:15,810  -->  00:08:20,250
this content to the the tabs layout

153

00:08:20,250  -->  00:08:22,470
itself, and again this is a QWidget and

154

00:08:22,470  -->  00:08:25,020
so it can be shown and it can have a

155

00:08:25,020  -->  00:08:27,990
layout set on it, so we access this

156

00:08:27,990  -->  00:08:31,349
object again by typing this. So let's go

157

00:08:31,349  -->  00:08:33,270
ahead and set the layout, so self.

158

00:08:33,270  -->  00:08:35,959
tabs[i].

159

00:08:37,110  -->  00:08:41,849
setLayout, and we're going to set it to self.

160

00:08:41,849  -->  00:08:54,839
tabs[i].layout. I'm going to comment

161

00:08:54,839  -->  00:08:57,420
this here so you guys will have an easier

162

00:08:57,420  -->  00:09:04,290
time following along, set top level tab from

163

00:09:04,290  -->  00:09:18,959
list to layout. Alright, now we need to

164

00:09:18,959  -->  00:09:21,720
add the content to the layout itself so we're going to

165

00:09:21,720  -->  00:09:23,070
do that here,

166

00:09:23,070  -->  00:09:27,779
add webview to tabs layout. We're going

167

00:09:27,779  -->  00:09:32,579
to say self.tabs the current tab, layout.

168

00:09:32,579  -->  00:09:36,240
addWidget, and we're going to add self.

169

00:09:36,240  -->  00:09:44,130
tabs current tab content. Now we're

170

00:09:44,130  -->  00:09:47,279
almost done, I promise guys, so what we

171

00:09:47,279  -->  00:09:49,949
need to do is we need to set the

172

00:09:49,949  -->  00:09:53,130
container which is the stackedlayout

173

00:09:53,130  -->  00:09:56,640
right here, we need to add this widget,

174

00:09:56,640  -->  00:09:58,350
the the QWidget that we've

175

00:09:58,350  -->  00:10:00,209
stuffed into the tab, we need to add this

176

00:10:00,209  -->  00:10:04,500
to the container, and then we need to set

177

00:10:04,500  -->  00:10:07,560
the current widget to the widget that

178

00:10:07,560  -->  00:10:09,209
we've just added, and how we're going to

179

00:10:09,209  -->  00:10:18,209
do that we're going to just type out

180

00:10:18,209  -->  00:10:22,709
self.container.layout.addWidget

181

00:10:22,709  -->  00:10:26,070
and we're going to add self.

182

00:10:26,070  -->  00:10:29,820
tabs and the current tab. So, again this

183

00:10:29,820  -->  00:10:32,760
basically equals a QWidget which we've

184

00:10:32,760  -->  00:10:40,019
defined here. And then self.

185

00:10:40,019  -->  00:10:47,630
container.layout.setCurrentWidget, and I'm

186

00:10:47,630  -->  00:10:52,010
going to set it to self.tabs and

187

00:10:52,010  -->  00:10:58,100
the current tab. Alright, now we need to

188

00:10:58,100  -->  00:11:00,020
show the tab at the top of the screen

189

00:11:00,020  -->  00:11:03,740
like as an actual tab. So, this is going

190

00:11:03,740  -->  00:11:10,640
to be a bit easier, set the tab at top of

191

00:11:10,640  -->  00:11:16,550
screen. self.tabbar.addTab

192

00:11:16,550  -->  00:11:22,700
and we're going to add "New Tab." And then

193

00:11:22,700  -->  00:11:24,650
what we need to do is remember up here

194

00:11:24,650  -->  00:11:26,840
where we set the object name of the top

195

00:11:26,840  -->  00:11:29,600
level widget right here, we set that to

196

00:11:29,600  -->  00:11:32,510
tab and then whatever number of tabs it

197

00:11:32,510  -->  00:11:34,670
is, so what we're going to do is we're

198

00:11:34,670  -->  00:11:36,770
going to set the data of, and let me show

199

00:11:36,770  -->  00:11:38,890
you.

200

00:11:40,010  -->  00:11:43,730
So this tab right here when we click it

201

00:11:43,730  -->  00:11:45,830
we need to be able to tell the stacked

202

00:11:45,830  -->  00:11:48,950
widget which widget to show. Now that's

203

00:11:48,950  -->  00:11:50,540
fine but there's going to be a problem

204

00:11:50,540  -->  00:11:54,410
when we do this it won't know,

205

00:11:54,410  -->  00:11:56,840
like it actually changes the index

206

00:11:56,840  -->  00:11:58,520
number of this, so if we say get a

207

00:11:58,520  -->  00:12:00,620
current index of this this is now going

208

00:12:00,620  -->  00:12:02,990
to be 0, if we drag it over here it's now

209

00:12:02,990  -->  00:12:06,800
one, but the content, the QWidget within

210

00:12:06,800  -->  00:12:09,830
our tabs list didn't change, so it's

211

00:12:09,830  -->  00:12:12,470
going to show the wrong content. So what

212

00:12:12,470  -->  00:12:14,120
we're doing is we're setting an object

213

00:12:14,120  -->  00:12:15,560
name and we're going to use the object

214

00:12:15,560  -->  00:12:19,700
name so we need to actually tell the tab

215

00:12:19,700  -->  00:12:28,730
what you know basically what object

216

00:12:28,730  -->  00:12:31,400
name it should control, and so we're

217

00:12:31,400  -->  00:12:34,610
going to say setTabData, and we're going to

218

00:12:34,610  -->  00:12:36,890
say "tab"

219

00:12:36,890  -->  00:12:42,010
and then the index number here,

220

00:12:42,730  -->  00:12:45,820
and then we need to set the current

221

00:12:45,820  -->  00:12:51,100
index to this current tab. So self.tabbar.setCurrent

222

00:12:51,100  -->  00:12:53,500
index and we're going to say this

223

00:12:53,500  -->  00:13:08,680
right here. So, go ahead and save...

224

00:13:08,680  -->  00:13:11,079
set the tab data, oh, alright. To set the tab data you need

225

00:13:11,079  -->  00:13:15,579
to tell it what you know is the

226

00:13:15,579  -->  00:13:17,649
index number of the tab you want to

227

00:13:17,649  -->  00:13:21,550
modify, so there we go.

228

00:13:21,550  -->  00:13:26,110
If I add a tab you're going to notice

229

00:13:26,110  -->  00:13:27,699
that we haven't actually built

230

00:13:27,699  -->  00:13:29,649
functionality for switching tabs so it

231

00:13:29,649  -->  00:13:31,660
is constantly shows whatever tab was

232

00:13:31,660  -->  00:13:33,610
loaded first, so we need to do that and we're

233

00:13:33,610  -->  00:13:36,839
going to do that in the next video.
