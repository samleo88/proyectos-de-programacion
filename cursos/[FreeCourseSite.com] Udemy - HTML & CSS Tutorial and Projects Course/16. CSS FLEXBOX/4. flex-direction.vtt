00:00.450 --> 00:01.110
Excellent.

00:01.140 --> 00:07.500
We now know general naming conventions so let's start looking at box properties one by one.

00:07.500 --> 00:14.400
Generally we can divide plex market properties into categories properties that affect all children and

00:14.400 --> 00:21.750
our set in a flux container or a parent element and the properties that affect individual child and

00:21.750 --> 00:25.990
are set to flex items separately meaning children separately.

00:26.220 --> 00:29.070
And we're going to cover parent properties first.

00:29.070 --> 00:36.830
Essentially properties that affect the layout of all children in our Flex container or a parent and

00:36.840 --> 00:44.460
the first property we're going to cover is going to be flex direction and it comes in multiple flavors.

00:44.460 --> 00:49.060
We have an option of rule which by the way is the default one.

00:49.290 --> 00:53.970
Then we have reverse value column as well as column reverse.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.820
So let's start one by one.

00:56.910 --> 01:02.270
First one we're going to cover Israel and I'm going to write the Flex direction.

01:02.490 --> 01:07.830
That is the property name and again please remember that these particular properties that we're going

01:07.830 --> 01:08.920
to cover first.

01:09.030 --> 01:15.330
And of course I'm going to mention once we switch with these particular properties are set on the parent

01:15.600 --> 01:18.350
always always they are set on the parent.

01:18.390 --> 01:24.010
And like I said first when we have the role and the moment we save it we notice that nothing changes.

01:24.030 --> 01:25.440
And the reason why nothing changes.

01:25.440 --> 01:31.380
Well like I said there are some properties with some values that are set right away by default.

01:31.380 --> 01:35.730
And this is the case more flex direction is right away cetera.

01:36.450 --> 01:39.240
So only if I'm going to change it and you know what.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.740
By the way I'm going to leave it for your reference for the time being.

01:42.930 --> 01:46.030
And we're going to change it to a real reverse.

01:46.110 --> 01:53.160
So let's write little reverse and notice right away how are boxes changed in fact the direction.

01:53.160 --> 01:53.820
Correct.

01:53.880 --> 01:59.160
Because in this case they were actually starting with one and all the way to the five.

01:59.160 --> 02:03.750
Well in this case we flipped them where where we had five before.

02:03.750 --> 02:08.600
Well first of all we have one and one is all the way on the right hand side.

02:08.730 --> 02:15.750
So reverse the order of our boxes as well as move them from one side which was the left side all the

02:15.750 --> 02:17.520
way to a right side.

02:17.610 --> 02:18.210
All right.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.460
That's number one.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.500
Then we also have a column.

02:21.600 --> 02:28.470
So let me copy and paste this first and then let's comment is out and let's write column and what you're

02:28.470 --> 02:31.260
going to notice is the moment we type column.

02:31.260 --> 02:35.980
In fact we go to our first layout that we had when we had the setup.

02:36.030 --> 02:41.080
So essentially we just head over back and instead of having a row which would be default.

02:41.280 --> 02:47.820
Well now we have a column layout and you can probably already guess that if I'm going to copy and paste

02:47.820 --> 02:53.490
it and not columns then let's copy and paste it and let's come in the south and let's try it.

02:53.490 --> 02:59.690
Column reverse you can probably already guessed that what is going to happen while our boxes are going

02:59.690 --> 03:04.190
to change order again where where we have a box number one.

03:04.260 --> 03:09.880
Currently we have box number five and we have successfully flipped the boxes pretty much around.

03:10.150 --> 03:10.730
OK.

03:10.960 --> 03:19.140
Now again since we are right away using row by default in most cases what's gonna happen if I specifically

03:19.140 --> 03:23.090
don't say that I'm adding the flux direction of let's say row.

03:23.190 --> 03:27.250
Well I'm just gonna go with default because there's really no point.

03:27.350 --> 03:29.950
There's of course other properties that we can set.

03:30.040 --> 03:35.220
We're not limited to this one flex direction but in most cases what you're going to see is the moment

03:35.220 --> 03:36.580
we set flex.

03:36.660 --> 03:42.690
Only if we would like to override this particular default let's say to a row reverse or column or column

03:42.690 --> 03:45.510
reverse we're just going to leave it the way it is right.

03:45.830 --> 03:51.270
That's the whole point of having those defaults where I could just go with the flex then I right have

03:51.270 --> 03:56.440
right away this flex direction of row and unless I specifically would like to change it.

03:56.520 --> 04:01.380
Well I'm just going to leave it blank correct because there there's no way for me or there's no point

04:01.380 --> 04:08.010
really for me to write this flux direction of row because nothing is going to change in my layout.
