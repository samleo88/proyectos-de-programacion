00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,389
Hey guys, before we get into switching

2

00:00:03,389  -->  00:00:04,950
tabs and stuff, one thing that i actually

3

00:00:04,950  -->  00:00:05,940
forgot

4

00:00:05,940  -->  00:00:08,820
in the last video is here we actually

5

00:00:08,820  -->  00:00:11,550
need to increase self tab count at the

6

00:00:11,550  -->  00:00:15,750
end of each instance of adding a tab. So,

7

00:00:15,750  -->  00:00:20,220
just jump up here and write self.tabCount

8

00:00:20,220  -->  00:00:26,580
+= 1. Now what we need

9

00:00:26,580  -->  00:00:29,519
to do is be able to switch tabs, so we

10

00:00:29,519  -->  00:00:32,669
actually need to hook into that when you

11

00:00:32,669  -->  00:00:35,460
click on tabs. So right here we need to

12

00:00:35,460  -->  00:00:45,690
write self.tabbar.tabBarClicked.

13

00:00:45,690  -->  00:00:49,260
It's a signal so remove those brackets

14

00:00:49,260  -->  00:00:51,899
and type connect. And here we're going

15

00:00:51,899  -->  00:00:59,969
to say self.SwitchTab. Now as with

16

00:00:59,969  -->  00:01:01,739
the close tab we don't need to send

17

00:01:01,739  -->  00:01:04,229
anything else with the method. It's

18

00:01:04,229  -->  00:01:06,630
automatically going to receive an index

19

00:01:06,630  -->  00:01:11,369
number of which tab you clicked. So let's

20

00:01:11,369  -->  00:01:14,040
drop down here and create the switch tab

21

00:01:14,040  -->  00:01:19,920
method. So, def SwitchTab, and this is

22

00:01:19,920  -->  00:01:23,130
the index number of the tab we want to

23

00:01:23,130  -->  00:01:26,729
switch. So, what we're going to do is

24

00:01:26,729  -->  00:01:31,439
we're going to, I'm going

25

00:01:31,439  -->  00:01:32,880
to show you guys the wrong way how to do it

26

00:01:32,880  -->  00:01:34,590
so that you guys will understand

27

00:01:34,590  -->  00:01:36,720
why we're doing it this way. So we have

28

00:01:36,720  -->  00:01:38,939
a tab, you might think we'll just

29

00:01:38,939  -->  00:01:41,490
be able to set the current widget by

30

00:01:41,490  -->  00:01:46,409
that, and so what we'll do is self.

31

00:01:46,409  -->  00:01:53,790
container.set.layout,

32

00:01:53,790  -->  00:01:56,610
sorry about that,

33

00:01:56,610  -->  00:02:00,630
.setCurrentWidget and we're going

34

00:02:00,630  -->  00:02:05,280
to set it to self.tabs[i], and

35

00:02:05,280  -->  00:02:07,920
that is the widget itself as we did here.

36

00:02:07,920  -->  00:02:10,619
This isn't going to work even though

37

00:02:10,619  -->  00:02:13,140
it is getting the index number there and

38

00:02:13,140  -->  00:02:13,380
I will

39

00:02:13,380  -->  00:02:16,860
show you guys what happens. So we've got one

40

00:02:16,860  -->  00:02:21,060
tab, this is tab 0. So now I'm going to do

41

00:02:21,060  -->  00:02:23,070
stuff in this tab and this page is

42

00:02:23,070  -->  00:02:26,130
different. Now I'm going to add a tab, and

43

00:02:26,130  -->  00:02:27,750
you'll see that it did show a new tab,

44

00:02:27,750  -->  00:02:34,380
and now I'm going to say YouTube, and

45

00:02:34,380  -->  00:02:36,030
I'm going to go to YouTube in this tab.

46

00:02:36,030  -->  00:02:39,900
So tab 0 is the Google results and tab

47

00:02:39,900  -->  00:02:43,920
1 is YouTube, and if I switch

48

00:02:43,920  -->  00:02:48,180
tabs it works. See that works very well,

49

00:02:48,180  -->  00:02:51,270
however the the index number of these

50

00:02:51,270  -->  00:02:54,330
tabs updates when you rearrange the tabs.

51

00:02:54,330  -->  00:02:57,210
So if I take tab 1 and make it tab 0,

52

00:02:57,210  -->  00:03:01,260
now it's going to show tab zero's content

53

00:03:01,260  -->  00:03:04,110
because it has become tab 0. And so what

54

00:03:04,110  -->  00:03:06,390
we need to do is we need to get the

55

00:03:06,390  -->  00:03:08,340
object name. That's why we're using object

56

00:03:08,340  -->  00:03:11,790
name to make sure we're getting the

57

00:03:11,790  -->  00:03:14,700
correct thing. So, we need to get the tab

58

00:03:14,700  -->  00:03:18,180
data of the tab that was clicked. So, td

59

00:03:18,180  -->  00:03:23,580
for tab data equals self.tabbar.

60

00:03:23,580  -->  00:03:26,790
tabData, and we need to just pass in

61

00:03:26,790  -->  00:03:28,830
the index number. So this is going to

62

00:03:28,830  -->  00:03:31,800
return the object name of the object

63

00:03:31,800  -->  00:03:34,440
that we want to switch to. So as you can

64

00:03:34,440  -->  00:03:40,950
see tab and then td. I'm going to

65

00:03:40,950  -->  00:03:42,450
print this for you guys so can see that it

66

00:03:42,450  -->  00:03:46,320
doesn't matter if we switch tabs,

67

00:03:46,320  -->  00:03:51,420
it's still going to recognize it. So, add

68

00:03:51,420  -->  00:03:54,810
a tab, so tab one is now just the google

69

00:03:54,810  -->  00:03:58,380
results and tabs 0 is, well just google,

70

00:03:58,380  -->  00:04:00,810
and tab 0 is the actual tabs. So as you can

71

00:04:00,810  -->  00:04:02,280
see when I click on it down here it

72

00:04:02,280  -->  00:04:05,250
said tab 0 because that is tab 0, tab 0

73

00:04:05,250  -->  00:04:06,930
equals the google results. When I click

74

00:04:06,930  -->  00:04:09,540
on this it says tab 1 because tab 1

75

00:04:09,540  -->  00:04:11,400
equals the google page that has no

76

00:04:11,400  -->  00:04:15,510
results. Now when I drag it this still says

77

00:04:15,510  -->  00:04:19,410
tab one, and that's because we set

78

00:04:19,410  -->  00:04:21,660
that data. So it doesn't matter how you

79

00:04:21,660  -->  00:04:24,090
rearrange them, it's always going to

80

00:04:24,090  -->  00:04:25,680
have a static

81

00:04:25,680  -->  00:04:29,340
tab data. So what we're going to do is

82

00:04:29,340  -->  00:04:31,860
we're going to set the tab contents,

83

00:04:31,860  -->  00:04:36,240
well I'm going to write this out, tab

84

00:04:36,240  -->  00:04:39,870
content equals self.findChild.

85

00:04:39,870  -->  00:04:43,320
And then the first argument we pass

86

00:04:43,320  -->  00:04:46,470
through here is what kind of child

87

00:04:46,470  -->  00:04:48,720
we're looking for, what type, and the

88

00:04:48,720  -->  00:04:50,880
type is QWidget.

89

00:04:50,880  -->  00:04:55,110
The second thing we need to pass through

90

00:04:55,110  -->  00:04:59,940
is the name, the object name, of the thing

91

00:04:59,940  -->  00:05:01,740
we're trying to find, and so that is

92

00:05:01,740  -->  00:05:04,470
going to be tab,

93

00:05:04,470  -->  00:05:06,330
actually it's just going to be straight

94

00:05:06,330  -->  00:05:09,030
up the tab number as defined here in this

95

00:05:09,030  -->  00:05:13,560
variable. So, let's just type td or tab

96

00:05:13,560  -->  00:05:19,740
data. I'm going to make these variables more

97

00:05:19,740  -->  00:05:22,500
intuitive here.

98

00:05:22,500  -->  00:05:26,610
So, what we're going to do is use this

99

00:05:26,610  -->  00:05:31,289
now which has the correct tab content

100

00:05:31,289  -->  00:05:33,060
stored in this variable, we're going to

101

00:05:33,060  -->  00:05:36,150
use that to switch tabs. I'm going to save

102

00:05:36,150  -->  00:05:39,870
this and refresh our application, and

103

00:05:39,870  -->  00:05:40,680
you're going to see that it works

104

00:05:40,680  -->  00:05:44,400
exactly how we want it to now. So this is

105

00:05:44,400  -->  00:05:47,520
the page with content in it,

106

00:05:47,520  -->  00:05:50,490
ok, it's going to be YouTube, well I can't

107

00:05:50,490  -->  00:05:51,659
use that yet, right.

108

00:05:51,659  -->  00:05:57,389
So we all right we're set up.

109

00:05:57,389  -->  00:06:01,699
Ok, that was a...

110

00:06:04,910  -->  00:06:12,500
I clicked on something wrong

111

00:06:12,500  -->  00:06:13,400
there.

112

00:06:13,400  -->  00:06:17,990
Let's try this again. So this is the

113

00:06:17,990  -->  00:06:19,640
result,

114

00:06:19,640  -->  00:06:24,280
this one's going to be YouTube,

115

00:06:30,990  -->  00:06:33,870
there. Alright, let's open up one more

116

00:06:33,870  -->  00:06:40,550
and go to digg.com.

117

00:06:41,940  -->  00:06:45,630
Alright, so, now we've got tab 0 is google,

118

00:06:45,630  -->  00:06:51,030
tap 1 is YouTube, and tab 2 is digg. So

119

00:06:51,030  -->  00:06:53,670
now when I rearrange this tab 1

120

00:06:53,670  -->  00:06:56,370
becomes digg. This now has an index number

121

00:06:56,370  -->  00:07:00,360
of one, but it's still correct in loading

122

00:07:00,360  -->  00:07:01,950
the correct content,

123

00:07:01,950  -->  00:07:06,150
and that's exactly what we want. So,

124

00:07:06,150  -->  00:07:08,970
that's why we're doing object names when

125

00:07:08,970  -->  00:07:11,310
we switch tabs so we can get the correct

126

00:07:11,310  -->  00:07:13,440
object. And think about it like this,

127

00:07:13,440  -->  00:07:15,510
if you have ever done anything with web

128

00:07:15,510  -->  00:07:18,420
design when you set an ID on an HTML

129

00:07:18,420  -->  00:07:20,400
element that's essentially the exact same

130

00:07:20,400  -->  00:07:23,210
thing that is happening here.
