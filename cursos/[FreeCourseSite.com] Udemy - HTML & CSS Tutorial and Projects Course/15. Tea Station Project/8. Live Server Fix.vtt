00:00.580 --> 00:07.660
Hey guys before we start styling the next section I would like to make a quick change for my setup because

00:07.660 --> 00:11.740
live server is doing one of its annoying little things.

00:11.770 --> 00:17.050
Now let me first I'll show you what's happening so let's say we have the section here disco section

00:17.050 --> 00:22.930
and I'm gonna head over back to my CSX and I'm gonna say let's say for the skills section I would like

00:22.930 --> 00:23.980
to have different background.

00:24.130 --> 00:29.380
So let's say this is gonna be right now what's gonna happen is I would like to make these changes so

00:29.380 --> 00:32.800
you can see each and every time as we're writing the property what is happening.

00:32.830 --> 00:38.260
However the problem is that once in a while a live server decides that live server is going to do the

00:38.260 --> 00:39.130
full reload.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.390
Now what does that mean.

00:40.390 --> 00:45.490
Well the changes have been applied but I would need to scroll up and down each and every time and I

00:45.490 --> 00:49.400
find that really annoying especially as we're working throughout the senatorial.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.960
So first of all let me show you where this is coming from.

00:53.020 --> 00:59.860
So I must say if I'm gonna go to the settings and if I'm going to look for full reload time full reload

01:00.550 --> 01:05.680
reload and I'm gonna get the live server settings for reload.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.840
Technically it says that by default this should be false.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.200
So only if I click it here.

01:10.210 --> 01:11.570
This should be happening.

01:11.650 --> 01:17.860
However the problem is even if I am having this tour the false or if I'm not even clicking on the box

01:18.310 --> 01:20.040
as you can see it's still doing it.

01:20.260 --> 01:25.600
So even though I'm to say here false and we're gonna head over again to the styles we're going to scroll

01:25.600 --> 01:30.980
down and let's say a color is gonna be on on below.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.270
Then still gonna be getting the full reload.

01:33.430 --> 01:36.440
And again I find this really really annoying.

01:36.460 --> 01:40.230
So what I did is I changed the life server that I'm using.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.370
Again you don't have to do it maybe on your machine is not doing.

01:43.390 --> 01:46.550
And in my case like I'm saying it depends.

01:46.570 --> 01:49.330
Sometimes life server does that sometimes it doesn't do.

01:49.450 --> 01:52.130
So it really I guess depends on the day.

01:52.150 --> 01:59.980
So what I did is I found this guy and I actually have been using it on my other machine anyway so preview

02:00.100 --> 02:04.440
and believe there was preview on the web web server.

02:04.450 --> 02:06.100
That was nice extension.

02:06.190 --> 02:08.920
Again this is not gonna change anything dramatically.

02:09.100 --> 02:11.110
So we're gonna do the install first.

02:11.110 --> 02:11.860
We're going to install it.

02:12.520 --> 02:17.830
And the way you run it is again you right click it and then you have two options so you can either look

02:17.830 --> 02:20.280
on the browser or you can log on.

02:20.290 --> 02:20.650
I don't know.

02:20.650 --> 02:22.420
It was the side window or something like that.

02:23.260 --> 02:24.970
Let me first close the settings.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.490
So here I'm going to just get rid of this.

02:27.490 --> 02:29.540
When I say that I wouldn't want that.

02:29.620 --> 02:34.240
And the way this is gonna work right now let me close the extension tab.

02:34.270 --> 02:36.790
Let me also close the sidebar.

02:36.820 --> 02:39.640
I don't think we need it and go back to the files.

02:39.690 --> 02:41.090
Let me minimize this.

02:41.200 --> 02:46.810
And the one you right click it here and let me see you will probably needed to reloading.

02:46.810 --> 02:47.800
My apologies.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.960
Let me head over back.

02:49.960 --> 02:53.970
Let me see Where is my actual preview on the server.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.420
Then this is installed.

02:55.450 --> 02:57.780
So all this has been working really well.

02:57.880 --> 02:58.680
So that's weird.

02:58.800 --> 02:59.180
Oh yeah.

02:59.410 --> 03:02.110
So we needed to go back to the next session and that was the difference.

03:02.110 --> 03:03.100
My apologies.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.050
You couldn't do it.

03:04.060 --> 03:09.050
I believe we could have done the life server from the mains to assess what's making him go back to the

03:09.550 --> 03:10.200
files.

03:10.450 --> 03:13.700
But we could do it the life server from the CSF.

03:13.720 --> 03:20.710
But here with this preview on the web server you do need to do it from the HDMI and that case again

03:20.710 --> 03:25.930
you have two things you have the side panel as well as the browser on my case what I would like to do

03:25.930 --> 03:27.790
is launch it in a browser.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.970
Now this is going to launch it in a browser and this uses the browser thing.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.490
So now this is gonna fix my problem.

03:33.490 --> 03:39.430
I'm gonna go back to the style sensors and let's say we're going to add some different color yellow

03:40.120 --> 03:45.610
then the changes are gonna happen right here and this is not gonna do the full reload which is gonna

03:45.610 --> 03:51.980
be much much more beneficial for us especially because I want you to see each and every time what we're

03:52.000 --> 03:56.510
doing we the property and what kind of changes it's affecting again.

03:56.530 --> 04:02.250
Long story short if this does not affect you you don't have to change it and thing with the left server.

04:02.260 --> 04:07.990
However if you are experiencing the same problems as I am you can go ahead and use this preview on the

04:07.990 --> 04:08.720
web server.

04:08.740 --> 04:14.740
So I'm gonna close the extension I will gonna get rid of this live server one that's open and also remember

04:14.800 --> 04:20.680
if you do have it open on the big one it's not technically gonna make a difference you can keep this

04:20.770 --> 04:28.690
as a live server one however for the other one preview on the web there is a different host so we need

04:28.690 --> 04:35.110
to be looking for 80 80 and then we have forward slash indexation AML.

04:35.260 --> 04:38.550
So again this is just gonna be our Live Preview anyway.

04:38.650 --> 04:42.360
And that would be the only changes that I would like to quickly make.

04:42.460 --> 04:47.180
Just in case you are experiencing the same issues that I am with a life server.
