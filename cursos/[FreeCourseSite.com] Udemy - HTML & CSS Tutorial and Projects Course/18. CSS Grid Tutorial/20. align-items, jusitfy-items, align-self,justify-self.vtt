00:00.380 --> 00:07.710
And similarly how we can align items themselves whether that's horizontally and vertically we can also

00:07.770 --> 00:10.790
align the content within the items.

00:10.890 --> 00:18.150
Now in order to cover that one I'm going to do right now in fact again use our favor repeat function

00:18.780 --> 00:22.350
and the way I'm going to set this up is following.

00:22.350 --> 00:27.630
So I'm gonna write repeat I would like to have three columns all of them are going to be one fraction

00:27.830 --> 00:28.140
like.

00:28.190 --> 00:31.200
So let's do the same thing with a row.

00:31.300 --> 00:37.920
But of course let's just change it to a two rows two rows and each of them is going to be one fraction

00:38.550 --> 00:44.760
and then if you'd like to work with the content within the items vertically we're going to use the line

00:44.970 --> 00:45.780
items.

00:45.790 --> 00:52.230
Then we have also justified items for the horizontal one and then we can move the actual individual

00:52.230 --> 00:54.510
content within the item.

00:54.510 --> 01:00.180
Now I'm not going to cover all the values because again we are already repeating ourselves but we're

01:00.180 --> 01:02.210
just going to go over these basics.

01:02.340 --> 01:05.450
So let's write let's say a line items.

01:05.460 --> 01:08.100
So this should be a vertical alignment.

01:08.160 --> 01:12.620
So if I'm gonna set this up to a center you're going to notice something interesting.

01:12.720 --> 01:19.570
We're right now in fact the content within the item is sitting in the center.

01:20.010 --> 01:26.700
Now in order to show that I am going to go over and we're going to take a look at the dev tools so let's

01:26.700 --> 01:36.000
inspect and let's look at our grid and you're going to notice that we still have our actual cell that

01:36.000 --> 01:42.500
is using one fraction whether that is a column and then one fraction that is using as a rule.

01:42.550 --> 01:47.850
Okay but the content within the row right now is vertically aligned in the center.

01:48.180 --> 01:50.110
So that would be a distinction.

01:50.130 --> 01:54.570
Now we also have of course the value of let's say flex.

01:54.630 --> 01:59.820
And so now we're placing the content all the way in the end and place it in the start.

01:59.940 --> 02:05.400
And you get an idea now similarly how we have a line items.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.910
We also have justify hand items.

02:07.920 --> 02:13.820
So what I could do here is I can justify my items and let's say center.

02:13.890 --> 02:15.690
So what's going to happen right now.

02:15.690 --> 02:17.590
Again let's head over to the bigger screen.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.080
Again we still have our grid.

02:20.280 --> 02:20.730
Correct.

02:20.730 --> 02:27.140
So we still have ourselves but the actual content within the cell has been shifted.

02:27.540 --> 02:33.030
So now it is sitting actually in a center all the way in the top because we have the Flex start and

02:33.030 --> 02:36.630
then we have a justify item's value of center.

02:36.630 --> 02:42.360
And if you'd like to look at the values of course there right here like sand like start and so on and

02:42.360 --> 02:43.530
so forth.

02:43.740 --> 02:51.060
Now I'm going to go with let's say flex start and we also have justified cell and a line cell for single

02:51.060 --> 02:51.690
item.

02:51.780 --> 02:57.890
So let's say I would like to change my positioning for the content within the cell number one.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.710
So let's select cell number one.

02:59.820 --> 03:01.000
That's number one.

03:01.140 --> 03:09.540
And then why do we say justify self and why don't we go then let's say something like that.

03:09.540 --> 03:14.890
So now my content has been shifted to the right hand side like so.

03:14.910 --> 03:20.220
And again we can head over here and we can see that it is still sitting within our cell but now we're

03:20.220 --> 03:22.430
talking about the content itself.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.090
OK.

03:23.130 --> 03:29.390
Our text and of course I can move it all the way to let's say bottom OK where instead of the line items

03:29.410 --> 03:39.690
flex start I could say align self and I'm going to go with a flex and like so now my content is setting

03:39.990 --> 03:41.550
all the way in the bottom.

03:41.550 --> 03:47.480
So that's how we can in fact control the individual item content.

03:47.850 --> 03:54.410
So whatever we have within the actual item we can also control it by using a line items just for items

03:54.930 --> 04:01.380
or if we would like to control the specific item we can use justify self as well as a line.

04:01.460 --> 04:01.890
Self.
