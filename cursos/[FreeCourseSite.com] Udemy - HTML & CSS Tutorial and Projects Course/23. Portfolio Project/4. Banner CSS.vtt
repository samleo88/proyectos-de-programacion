WEBVTT

00:00.070 --> 00:07.620
The words go to the main are here and after the import the first thing that we would need to write is

00:07.670 --> 00:13.800
are going to select all the elements that are going to say that the margin is going to be zero.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.390
The padding is also going to be zero.

00:16.410 --> 00:21.660
So basically we're going to get rid of all the the fault margins and paddings and then we're going to

00:21.660 --> 00:26.910
say we're here box sizing or here and for the box sizing we're going to say Borba.

00:27.210 --> 00:33.120
And basically what this does is if you're going to be applying any kind of margin and padding This is

00:33.120 --> 00:36.350
actually not going to expand the actual element.

00:36.510 --> 00:41.490
It's just going to make sure that elements stays the way we actually set up and the padding is going

00:41.490 --> 00:44.290
to be applied on the inside of the aisle.

00:44.550 --> 00:49.560
Now once we have selected all the elements then we're going to start working with our route.

00:49.650 --> 00:54.600
Now the reason why we're going to be working with the route because we're going to be using a C Ss variables

00:55.040 --> 01:01.030
because what this is going to help us is you can see or hear that I selected pretty neutral colors.

01:01.050 --> 01:06.240
However since we're going to be working CIRCE's very most what you're going to be able to do is you're

01:06.240 --> 01:11.940
going to be able to change the colors for the variables and the colors are going to be changed right

01:11.940 --> 01:12.450
away.

01:12.550 --> 01:15.140
For all the elements where you use the variables.

01:15.330 --> 01:18.470
So this gives you a lot of flexibility.

01:18.510 --> 01:24.870
Now if you want to work with a C assess variables what we need here is a colon and then we're going

01:24.870 --> 01:26.140
to say we're here.

01:26.400 --> 01:33.450
And if we want to create a variable what we have is all here two hyphens here and then we're going to

01:33.450 --> 01:34.820
call this light.

01:34.930 --> 01:36.940
This is going to be a name or a variable.

01:37.020 --> 01:39.340
And here we're going to say that this is going to be the caller.

01:39.540 --> 01:41.660
So I'm going to say hash tag FFR.

01:41.910 --> 01:47.750
And basically what this also helps is as we're working now it's going to be able to use this color.

01:47.970 --> 01:54.000
So once we have created here this variable if I'm going to go and if we know that we have let's say

01:54.000 --> 01:55.470
we're here now.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.530
So this was our element.

01:57.660 --> 02:03.230
And if I'm just going to go back on here I can just say it for this now I we're here what I would want.

02:03.270 --> 02:07.890
Well since I know that this is going to be the class I'm going to select it as a class let's say we're

02:07.890 --> 02:13.950
here to add background and let's say that background is not going to be this f f I actually want to

02:13.950 --> 02:14.860
save our.

02:14.940 --> 02:16.660
So we need to use this word.

02:16.800 --> 02:22.450
And then all here once we have two hyphens we can see or hear that we have this lifeone.

02:22.560 --> 02:27.810
So we're going to select it here but unfortunately we can't see anything for it because we haven't placed

02:27.900 --> 02:29.300
any kind of elements.

02:29.330 --> 02:34.530
So we're all going to go back over here and let's say that in the now if not just create some I don't

02:34.530 --> 02:37.320
know we're heading once and we're going to write or.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.140
Hello.

02:38.250 --> 02:43.530
And you don't need to do this I'm just doing it just to show you that the color is actually work.

02:43.570 --> 02:47.690
Now I can see that I have a text but we're not sure whether we have the color code.

02:47.850 --> 02:50.260
So let's go back over here to the makes sense.

02:50.400 --> 02:56.400
And like I said with a variable you have named the variable you have used a variable with a VAR key

02:56.410 --> 03:01.860
word and the only thing is let's say that we will want to change the color so we're going to say F 1

03:01.920 --> 03:09.770
5 0 2 5 or so once I served you can see the right way my background actually is orange right now.

03:09.900 --> 03:12.260
And this is the nice thing about variables.

03:12.420 --> 03:17.880
So you can use it throughout a document and later on if you don't think that this is the right color.

03:18.240 --> 03:23.400
You can just change the color and it's going to change the color all over the document so you don't

03:23.400 --> 03:29.850
need to find each and every element that you use this color without a variable and you can change it

03:29.850 --> 03:31.560
much more easier.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.790
So we're going to go back over here and we're going to say F F again.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.550
So this is going to be our background.

03:36.780 --> 03:40.540
Then the next one is going to be here again this index.

03:40.600 --> 03:49.920
Then we're going to call this a dark and dark room and I say hash tag 1 8 1 b over here and 2 4.

03:50.130 --> 03:55.800
So this helps me also while I'm recording that I don't actually need to repeat them so we can just create

03:55.860 --> 04:00.870
this variable and later on we're going to use the variable then the next one is going to be the gray

04:00.870 --> 04:01.770
one.

04:01.770 --> 04:09.150
We're here and we're going to say hash tag 8 9 9 4 and 9 5.

04:09.300 --> 04:15.150
So this is going to be our great car once we save it then we're going to have an orange color.

04:15.150 --> 04:16.880
So there's going to be only two more.

04:17.020 --> 04:20.160
So one of them is going to be orange and orange.

04:20.160 --> 04:31.800
We're going to have a hash tag then we're going to have a F and C 5 and 1 3 0 0 like this.

04:31.800 --> 04:36.240
So this is going to be my Orridge the last one is going to be S. Gray.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.510
So I'm going to call this over here a section break.

04:39.520 --> 04:44.070
So this is going to be used in one of the sections and we're going to say here that this is going to

04:44.070 --> 04:44.930
be hashed.

04:45.020 --> 04:48.800
F 2 2 2 4 here.

04:48.830 --> 04:52.180
So once we say read I can see that I have my variables.

04:52.290 --> 04:58.380
Now we're going to leave this now with this background color like over here for now and we're actually

04:58.380 --> 05:02.620
going to move on and we're working with an actual batter.

05:02.860 --> 05:06.710
So what we're going to say over here is that this is going to be a comment.

05:06.870 --> 05:12.540
So this is going to be the you know going to say and of math because we're all going to return to this

05:12.810 --> 05:18.840
because I think it's more useful if I show you how we working with a flex box with the whole thing because

05:18.840 --> 05:22.210
there's quite a few rules for the knife itself.

05:22.210 --> 05:26.690
And here once we have the end of knife we're all going to call this a banner.

05:27.030 --> 05:29.070
And this is going to be the end of that.

05:29.370 --> 05:30.880
So end of.

05:31.230 --> 05:37.880
And maybe what I would want is just grab this body and actually move it all the way on the top.

05:37.890 --> 05:43.680
So after the road actually we would have this body with a rubato and a monospace.

05:43.680 --> 05:49.060
So we have a whole selector then on here body route and this would be hidden.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.100
And what we're going to have in the bar.

05:51.420 --> 05:54.480
Well first let's say on here this is going to be the head.

05:54.840 --> 05:59.390
Because before we actually can work with a banner let's do a header.

05:59.490 --> 06:02.470
I'm sorry I actually forgot about the elementary.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.560
So for that matter we're going to say we're here like this.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.690
We're going to say we would want to select the header and then first things first.

06:08.730 --> 06:11.260
What I would want is this parent element.

06:11.430 --> 06:17.150
You can see this parent element of Hetter I would want to make it a 100 percent view.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.760
So I would want to make it always 100 percent.

06:20.760 --> 06:26.360
So what I'm going to say here mean height here and this is going to be hundred yards.

06:26.400 --> 06:32.760
So in any screen size and any situation minimum this is going to be hundred to you then we're going

06:32.760 --> 06:40.530
to say also here that we would want a background here and we would want a you know now for what we would

06:40.530 --> 06:44.130
want for you RL wouldn't be a better background.

06:44.310 --> 06:46.290
So I'm going to say we're here not.

06:46.350 --> 06:50.730
And then we're going to look for the image for that we had and then you can see here and this is going

06:50.730 --> 06:52.530
to be a background image.

06:52.530 --> 06:57.050
So once I selected you can see that I have my background image.

06:57.180 --> 07:00.440
Now I also want to fix or hear a few things with an image.

07:00.480 --> 07:06.730
So first I'm going to say that I would want a background image in the center then I'm going to say that

07:06.730 --> 07:10.020
I would want a background image to cover everything.

07:10.020 --> 07:12.600
So basically this is going to cover the whole thing.

07:12.600 --> 07:19.110
So once I saved you can see that image is actually in the center and the actual image is covering the

07:19.110 --> 07:20.010
whole screen.

07:20.220 --> 07:23.110
And after that we're going to say that we will want it fixed.

07:23.190 --> 07:25.050
So as we're going to be scrolling.

07:25.110 --> 07:27.790
This is actually going to be a parallax effect.

07:27.960 --> 07:34.150
So you can see or hear as I'm scrolling down you can see that image is staying fixed.

07:34.150 --> 07:41.630
So what we're doing here we're adding this actual value of fixed and they're all here once we have a

07:41.630 --> 07:43.710
fixed we're also going to write no repeat.

07:43.940 --> 07:50.050
So this is going to make sure that for if the image is not big enough this is not going to be actually

07:50.070 --> 07:52.360
repeating all across the screen.

07:52.390 --> 07:59.650
So once we have these properties what we also want to do is place an overlay because this image is actually

07:59.650 --> 08:04.810
going to be too bright because you can see or hear that this text we're actually going to be making

08:04.810 --> 08:05.540
it right.

08:05.770 --> 08:08.350
So this image is going to be actually right.

08:08.530 --> 08:12.910
So what we would want is actually make it a little bit lighter.

08:13.090 --> 08:16.770
So we're going to say we're here that we would want a linear gradient.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.760
We never really know.

08:20.080 --> 08:23.740
We're going to call this linear gradient so gradient.

08:24.290 --> 08:31.330
Well know this once we'd actually type the gradient now we would want to place a comma and one here

08:31.330 --> 08:34.110
after the and we're going to have a parentheses.

08:34.240 --> 08:39.770
So going right on linear really just make sure that you place or hear news coming otherwise the C S

08:40.000 --> 08:43.660
is going to think that this is one actual value here.

08:43.710 --> 08:45.950
Well what I would want is actual color.

08:46.060 --> 08:48.100
So I'm going to say R G-B.

08:48.370 --> 08:54.480
And for this we're going to say 255 and 255 255.

08:54.640 --> 08:59.620
So basically I'm placing a white collar and I'm going to say over here 0.3.

08:59.620 --> 09:02.620
And I think that I said that I would want to make the image darker.

09:02.620 --> 09:04.630
But actually we're going to be making lighter.

09:04.630 --> 09:07.050
So I'm sorry but before that I misspoke.

09:07.330 --> 09:09.690
So here if this is going to be our GBN.

09:09.910 --> 09:15.670
So this is going to be my first color and this is going to be my second call and if I would just want

09:16.150 --> 09:19.840
this we need a gradient cover with the same color.

09:19.960 --> 09:29.030
You can see over here and we can have a 2:55 again to 55 and 255 over here and point zero or here.

09:29.040 --> 09:36.460
So once I say it you can see that image right away got lighter now by default the actual linear a gradient

09:36.820 --> 09:39.310
has a actual destination.

09:39.310 --> 09:45.760
So here you can see if I'm going to change this to let's say one or two like this you can see that we

09:45.760 --> 09:51.940
need a green and by the fold is starting from the top because this was actually 0.3.

09:52.060 --> 09:56.860
And on the bottom this is actually one because I made it completely white.

09:56.860 --> 10:03.850
Now or here if we type in front of our GPA to the right or to the left just make sure that you have

10:03.850 --> 10:10.040
a column we can actually change the right direction or here from one set to the right or here.

10:10.180 --> 10:12.240
Just make sure that you place the comma.

10:12.310 --> 10:14.840
You can see that now I'm starting here.

10:15.070 --> 10:16.960
And this is going to the right.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.990
Now we are just going to keep a default form.

10:19.030 --> 10:23.580
So we're going to go back over here I'm going to leave this right and we're going to say we don't here

10:23.580 --> 10:24.410
like this.

10:24.430 --> 10:31.180
Now since I want the whole overlay to be the same value I'm just going to say here and both of them

10:31.180 --> 10:32.720
are going to be 0.

10:32.860 --> 10:37.630
So this is how we're going to create or here is image with an overlay.

10:37.960 --> 10:44.890
Now after that also what I would want is I wouldn't want to use the fact that this Hetter can be a fluxbox

10:44.910 --> 10:45.540
parent.

10:45.790 --> 10:51.880
So we're going to say this is going to be in this play Flexo we're here and we're going to say flex

10:52.110 --> 10:53.630
direction on here.

10:53.800 --> 11:00.280
And for the Flex action we're actually going to have a call now now we cannot really see anything right

11:00.280 --> 11:03.300
now because like I said we needed to pay attention.

11:03.340 --> 11:05.230
We have two children here.

11:05.470 --> 11:12.100
We have a flex box behind which is going to be in our case we already made it the parent and over here

11:12.100 --> 11:16.960
this is going to be our first child and this is going to be our second show and now we said it have

11:16.960 --> 11:19.050
it as a flex box column.

11:19.100 --> 11:24.160
All right so if I'm going to go back over here and actually start working with the banner we're going

11:24.160 --> 11:28.150
to be able to see how we can use the fact that both of them are children.

11:28.540 --> 11:35.860
Now for that matter what I'm going to say here banner some selecting a section with a glass of batter.

11:36.070 --> 11:40.310
And for this I'm just going to say we're here like this as a flex champ.

11:40.330 --> 11:43.260
So this was this was going to be working as a child.

11:43.570 --> 11:46.910
So we're going to make sure that this rule is going to be as chopped.

11:47.050 --> 11:52.960
So over here what I'm going to say is going to be flex and we're going to grow as much as necessary

11:53.210 --> 11:59.960
here then we're going to say that we are not going to shrink and the actual basis is going to be all

11:59.970 --> 12:00.720
over.

12:00.850 --> 12:03.610
Now we can see again nothing technically changed.

12:03.640 --> 12:10.900
However if I'm going to go back to the half an hour here in the Senate I'm going to keep on adding these

12:11.240 --> 12:11.930
ones.

12:11.980 --> 12:19.600
So let's say we're here three any Once you see what happens this actual rest of the banter is always

12:19.600 --> 12:27.850
going to be making sure that it takes this much of space or because we had a flex grow of one flex shrink

12:27.940 --> 12:36.700
of zero here and the basis was and since this is a lay out column I can make this banner and this now

12:37.320 --> 12:44.390
much as I want have in height and the banner is always going to make sure that it uses the rest of the

12:44.390 --> 12:45.170
space.

12:45.170 --> 12:47.910
You can see that the flex direction is going to be calm.

12:48.200 --> 12:54.470
And then over here this guy is going to be using the fact that with a flex we can always grow as much

12:54.470 --> 12:55.530
as we want.

12:55.880 --> 12:59.760
Now we also can make this banner as a fluxbox better.

12:59.990 --> 13:03.090
So I'd say we're here and this is going to be a flexible experiment.

13:03.290 --> 13:10.230
So I would say as a parent and now let's create this this boy flex for the actual banner.

13:10.250 --> 13:14.930
So when I say display flex then I'm going to say justify content.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.380
And we would want to content in the center.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.950
So we're going to say we're just content center.

13:20.120 --> 13:28.790
Now also what I would want is once I have a justified content in the center I also would want a line

13:28.910 --> 13:30.750
items over here in the center.

13:31.010 --> 13:38.150
So here we're going to say on line items and you are going to say flex and or here now as you can see

13:38.150 --> 13:43.790
or hear now my text is actually all the way in the bottom.

13:43.790 --> 13:46.080
So this is what I want or hear.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.830
Now after that what I would want is give it a dark color.

13:50.020 --> 13:55.730
So I'm going to say here the caller is actually going to be dark so let's say over here that this is

13:55.730 --> 14:02.090
going to be a color war and I can see that we can use our very Mo and we can just say all this is going

14:02.090 --> 14:03.560
to be the dark text.

14:03.560 --> 14:11.060
Now once we have the dark text then we would want a text align center over here so I can see that the

14:11.390 --> 14:20.030
text is actually going to be in the center and out of that we would want a padding bottom padding and

14:20.030 --> 14:25.800
you can see up in line and we would want padding bottom padding bottom.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.390
And here we're going to say for all Reems here so now we got a little bit of space and then we're going

14:32.390 --> 14:38.810
to use a font weight that we actually got from the goal posts and here we're going to say this is going

14:38.810 --> 14:45.960
to be 700 or so this is going to be our Found way now once we have a farm.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.550
Wait no it's actually say that we would want to work with a title.

14:50.750 --> 14:53.320
So this was actually a banner.

14:53.510 --> 14:56.480
No one here would want to work with a band or title.

14:56.480 --> 15:03.670
So we're all going to say that banner title here some of these are going to be two underscores here

15:03.680 --> 15:06.120
what we would want for the banner title.

15:06.180 --> 15:11.490
We're going to say font size and this is going to be for all Reems here.

15:11.690 --> 15:18.890
So this is going to be the bigger text then we're going to say that we would want a letter spacing.

15:18.890 --> 15:28.360
So it's a rare letter and spacing for the letter spacing we're going to have a 0.1 RPMs here.

15:28.520 --> 15:36.700
When I say now we're going to have a bigger spacing margin but I'm going to do a zero point five rpms.

15:36.730 --> 15:42.350
So in this case we're going to create a more space in the bottom and then we're going to have a font

15:42.680 --> 15:46.380
style here and we're going to say that this is going to be Taluk.

15:46.450 --> 15:46.770
All right.

15:46.790 --> 15:48.610
So this is going to be topic next.

15:48.710 --> 15:56.140
And then let's do last one text text or here transform and let's do capitalize on it.

15:56.150 --> 16:02.870
So let's make every first letter actually the capital letter and after that we would want the actual

16:03.650 --> 16:05.180
banner jobs.

16:05.180 --> 16:06.760
So this is going to be over here.

16:06.920 --> 16:12.030
The actual data that we created or the heading 1 the banner jobs.

16:12.030 --> 16:18.220
So let's go back over here and let's say that this is going to be banner and two underscores jobs.

16:18.230 --> 16:25.780
Now for the better jobs we're going to we will want the same letter spacings zero point fifty RPMs here

16:26.390 --> 16:35.450
and then we're going to have the same text transform text here transform and let's do again capitalize

16:35.910 --> 16:36.250
here.

16:36.270 --> 16:47.210
Let's do a font size of one point for all Reems one point five RPMs and then do a color light color

16:47.490 --> 16:52.840
war here and let's do again this is going to be a light color.

16:53.270 --> 17:00.870
And I can see that I am clever techie and out here and this is going to be the actual ballot jobs.

17:00.980 --> 17:07.080
Now the actual nav bar will going to be doing at the very end because like I said there's going to be

17:07.370 --> 17:11.320
quite a few success and the actual HD now.

17:11.510 --> 17:17.560
So I don't want to scare you yet away but successfully we have our first section.

17:17.630 --> 17:23.030
So if I'm going to go back over here where I have it in the browser and if you're going to refresh you

17:23.030 --> 17:26.100
can see or hear then this is going to be our first section.

17:26.200 --> 17:30.800
And as you can see that this is taking exactly a hundred years hence.

17:30.850 --> 17:37.210
So exactly 100 percent of the actual screen and you can see that we have the background this is going

17:37.210 --> 17:38.160
to be the title.

17:38.310 --> 17:40.540
I know and this is going to be our subject.

17:40.660 --> 17:44.760
And now we are ready to move on and start working on the next section.
