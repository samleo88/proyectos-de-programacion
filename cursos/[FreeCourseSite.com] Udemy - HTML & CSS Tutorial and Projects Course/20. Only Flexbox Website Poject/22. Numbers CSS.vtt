00:00.160 --> 00:04.560
When our CEO says the first thing here we created a comments.

00:04.560 --> 00:09.420
This is going to be for a number so we're going to see or hear Mersch and or hear we're going to say

00:09.420 --> 00:12.750
this is going to be padding for the pixels.

00:12.760 --> 00:20.250
All right this afternoon we're going to target a single number so I'm going to say number here and then

00:20.250 --> 00:26.370
we're going to have a margin 20 pixels or you know like this and then zero here.

00:26.520 --> 00:27.600
Now there we have this.

00:27.600 --> 00:34.920
We're going to say text align center here and we're going to have a transition here and this is going

00:34.920 --> 00:36.580
to be trends for one.

00:36.750 --> 00:37.420
All right.

00:37.650 --> 00:39.890
Two seconds each.

00:40.250 --> 00:43.560
All right now have a transformation here.

00:43.650 --> 00:54.600
We're going to select this number here hover over here and they're all going to say transform transform

00:54.820 --> 01:01.080
and we're going to translate and we're going to say translate why or here and we're going to say minus

01:01.410 --> 01:03.320
10 pixels right.

01:03.360 --> 01:08.300
So as we're having we're actually going to translate or do a cursor.

01:08.310 --> 01:09.710
I'm going to say pointer.

01:09.770 --> 01:15.540
All right let's move on and let's actually have for a fantasy.

01:15.540 --> 01:16.240
My God.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.790
So I'm going to say number here.

01:18.830 --> 01:22.040
Hey I like this font size.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.130
I'm going to say font size.

01:24.220 --> 01:27.850
Sixty sixty pixels right.

01:27.860 --> 01:29.330
Or something like this.

01:29.350 --> 01:38.360
Then after that we're going to have a color hash tag on here to be here 9 8 0.

01:38.580 --> 01:46.410
Then after that we would want to actually work with a heading to someone say number two and then I'm

01:46.560 --> 01:52.760
going to say font size and let's say we are 40 pixels in this.

01:52.890 --> 02:00.660
And then after that we're going to have a margin margin 10 pixels 0 and this and that or here is do

02:00.750 --> 02:05.110
a font weight font weight you know and this.

02:05.110 --> 02:11.000
So I just do and let's say 900 hundred this guy.

02:11.220 --> 02:14.780
And then after that we would want a heading five.

02:15.150 --> 02:17.680
So we're here with we're going to say this is going to be.

02:17.850 --> 02:28.890
We're adding five more here and we're going to have a font size and it's 23 pixels here and the color

02:28.890 --> 02:29.940
is going to be again.

02:29.940 --> 02:34.780
Hash tag see 99 C-9 really like this.

02:34.800 --> 02:40.830
Now we are ready to go on and actually start working with a media equerries for Responsive screen.
