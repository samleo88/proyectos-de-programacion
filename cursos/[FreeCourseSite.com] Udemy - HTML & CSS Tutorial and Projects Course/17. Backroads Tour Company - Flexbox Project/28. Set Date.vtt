WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:07.320
And we're going to start very simply by in fact adding our date dynamically no all the way in the bottom

00:07.350 --> 00:08.520
in the footer.

00:08.520 --> 00:11.560
We have the date now when I say date.

00:11.580 --> 00:20.700
I mean of course the year when this website was created and I just hardcoded first to 2019 here and

00:20.700 --> 00:26.790
what I would like to do is depending on which year we currently have we're going to showcase that.

00:26.790 --> 00:36.420
Also in the project meaning even if the year is let's say 2020 20 to 25 2015 is a matter we're going

00:36.420 --> 00:40.830
to right away use the javascript core functionality to showcase the proper date.

00:41.220 --> 00:44.720
So in my case I would like to delete the 2019.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.480
And that is going to be my start.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.860
And as you can see in the footer now I have the empty space.

00:49.860 --> 00:57.030
Again just please make sure that your I.D. is in fact as the value for the date.

00:57.090 --> 01:03.070
Now once we have this particular setup then I would like to head over back to AB J.S. first of all let

01:03.080 --> 01:09.050
just write a function by the name of console log and let's write Hello world.

01:09.060 --> 01:14.670
Now the reason why I'm typing in this function is I'm going to head over back to indexation Schimmel

01:15.020 --> 01:18.600
and remember when we had a comment for JavaScript.

01:18.990 --> 01:24.130
So now I'd like to use the script tags and the syntax is in fact following.

01:24.290 --> 01:31.290
So the same way how we used LINQ when we needed to have our style sheet remember we had a link that

01:31.290 --> 01:35.510
relationship as well as where these assets are sitting.

01:35.540 --> 01:41.100
Same we are doing with a javascript where for adjustable we're using these script tags.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.910
So we say script tags then the source.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.660
So this is going to be the path where the file is located.

01:47.910 --> 01:50.130
And yeah this is how we're gonna do it.

01:50.160 --> 01:55.740
So remember we have the app J.S. sitting within the s folder.

01:55.970 --> 02:00.500
So first of all let's not get to the Dress folder and then we have the app.

02:00.750 --> 02:01.810
We save that.

02:01.950 --> 02:08.790
And now if we right click it and click on inspect and instead of looking for the elements we're going

02:08.790 --> 02:13.440
to look at in the console and in the console you should have the hello world.

02:13.440 --> 02:19.380
Now the reason why we're doing that is because I want to make sure that in fact you have connected to

02:19.440 --> 02:26.370
a proper file because there's cases where you do some kind of functionality and you're looking for the

02:26.380 --> 02:33.120
errors because nothing is in fact working but in fact the error is not the code itself it's the fact

02:33.120 --> 02:38.010
that you have not properly provided the path for your file.

02:38.310 --> 02:44.250
So if you're having a console hello world you're good to go and we can start by setting up our date.

02:44.700 --> 02:50.610
Now what I'm going to do is in fact I'm going to add a comment of testing file and I'm just going to

02:50.610 --> 02:53.280
comment this out just for your reference.

02:53.280 --> 02:53.840
All right.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.530
Now first of all let me set up my comments and I'm going to use stars again and I'm going to write set

03:01.830 --> 03:05.220
date and we're going to add some more stars.

03:05.310 --> 03:11.220
So that is going to be our first step by setting up the date and first and foremost I would like to

03:11.220 --> 03:15.480
create a variable and again I apologize guys but this is not a jobs of course.

03:15.480 --> 03:20.210
So I'm not going to go over what this means setting up the variable or anything like that.

03:20.220 --> 03:23.910
All right so I'm gonna be quite swift with my code.

03:23.910 --> 03:30.360
So let's write a variable by the name of date and then we would like to select our I.D..

03:30.750 --> 03:38.460
So essentially the span with the idea of date so I'm gonna write document get element by D.

03:38.590 --> 03:44.810
And now I'd like to provide what would be in fact that I.D. and remember it was date.

03:44.820 --> 03:52.320
Now once we have selected our proper element then we have an option of setting up the in our HMO and

03:52.320 --> 03:57.170
I'm gonna set my inner HCM male equal to a new date.

03:57.390 --> 04:05.100
That is a job script object that we have access to and then we have a method of get full year.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.820
And since it is the method we do you need to use the parentheses.

04:08.820 --> 04:16.200
And now if we're going to scroll to the bottom you're gonna notice that even though in my index HMO

04:16.880 --> 04:18.630
it is nothing therefore a date.

04:18.630 --> 04:20.070
So this plan is empty.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.450
I do have two thousand ninety.

04:22.750 --> 04:23.670
Now the reason for that.

04:23.670 --> 04:30.610
Because when using just and functionality I can just get my current year and inserted in my HMO.

04:30.720 --> 04:38.310
So congrats guys we're done with our first functionality that is in fact setting up our year dynamically

04:38.310 --> 04:39.260
using job script.
