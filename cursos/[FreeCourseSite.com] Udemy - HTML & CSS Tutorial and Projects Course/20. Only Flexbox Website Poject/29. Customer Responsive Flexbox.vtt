We check on the full screen and you can see we're here and it's actually taking full size on here.

00:07.710 --> 00:10.830
So what you'd want to do is go Michael here.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.730
I already added a comment.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.380
Customer responsive.

00:14.740 --> 00:18.810
That note here we're going to say like this I'm going to say meet here and again we're going to see

00:18.810 --> 00:20.910
the screen and this is going to be.

00:20.970 --> 00:21.550
Right.

00:21.570 --> 00:29.600
So men with more here like this and this is going to be five and six pixels.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.640
And then we're going to have a customer center.

00:33.930 --> 00:39.360
So this is going to be custom Mersch and they're like this.

00:39.540 --> 00:46.630
And then we're going to see this play from Next here and we're going to have a flex ramp.

00:46.620 --> 00:46.930
Right.

00:46.930 --> 00:49.660
So again I can say this for now.

00:49.820 --> 00:51.470
Well let's just check what we have.

00:51.930 --> 00:55.530
So the refresh right now I can see all of them are like this right.

00:55.680 --> 00:59.490
Because this is actually going to be displaying in the flex.

00:59.490 --> 01:05.240
So the next thing that we would want is actually have a flex ramp and just if I can't content space

01:05.250 --> 01:05.890
between.

01:06.240 --> 01:16.110
So I'm going to say a flex flex here wrap them say wrap this and then we're going to say that this is

01:16.110 --> 01:22.500
going to be a just different content and this is going to be a space between.

01:22.830 --> 01:25.330
So I'm going to see this space in between.

01:25.650 --> 01:30.690
And then after that what I would want to do when we're here we're just going to say this is going to

01:30.690 --> 01:41.520
be customer customer here and we're going to say this is going to be a flex we're here then it's going

01:41.520 --> 01:52.160
to be 0 0 calc and on here 33 dot 3 percent.

01:53.290 --> 01:58.480
3 percent or here minus I would say or here again that's use.

01:58.780 --> 02:01.980
I don't know wanting him something like this right.

02:02.020 --> 02:04.940
So this is refresh right.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.770
And this is how it's going to work right.

02:06.770 --> 02:10.360
So now he's going to have a little bit more padding in between.

02:10.540 --> 02:14.680
And this is how we can make it team section responsive.

02:14.800 --> 02:21.870
And the last thing that we would want or here first of all would be changing the team here this time

02:21.910 --> 02:22.360
all right.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.370
So we need customers here.

02:24.560 --> 02:30.130
And after that we would want to do is actually build this last section right which is going to be a

02:30.130 --> 02:32.280
contact us section or here.

02:32.320 --> 02:39.850
So the first things first let's go to each team now and let's actually change over here and this customer

02:39.850 --> 02:40.420
reviews.
