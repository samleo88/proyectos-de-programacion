WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:01.030
Excellent.

00:01.030 --> 00:04.570
Once we have our HDMI outlet styled is bad boy.

00:04.710 --> 00:10.350
So we're gonna head over to Stiles he says we have end of hero.

00:10.440 --> 00:14.910
So what we could do is just copy and pasted two times.

00:14.910 --> 00:17.930
Let's in fact change this around.

00:18.000 --> 00:28.070
Say about we can write section we can just say about it doesn't really matter let's say about like so.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.760
Let's proceed.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.250
First of all remember the about class.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.390
And then we had.

00:33.390 --> 00:40.540
Well we're gonna use this class to set up some background some say background is going to be VR.

00:40.750 --> 00:47.730
And as you see we're using for the whole document for the body we have the background of of it.

00:48.360 --> 00:51.190
So in this case I'm gonna go for my main way.

00:51.850 --> 00:54.180
Remember we had that particular color.

00:54.270 --> 01:01.070
So my about section is going to be white instead of the typical off white.

01:02.070 --> 01:06.890
And then we have multiple items that I'm gonna set up within a global one.

01:07.320 --> 01:12.210
But again he's just a class name so you can access it all throughout the project.

01:12.210 --> 01:14.240
Even if you don't set it up in a.

01:14.460 --> 01:16.530
But I just prefer to do it this way.

01:16.950 --> 01:22.510
So one by one I'm gonna add the comments of what is being added within the global.

01:22.590 --> 01:27.220
So I'm gonna say section added to include.

01:27.300 --> 01:32.430
And then you know what I'm gonna copy and paste it in fact two more times.

01:32.430 --> 01:36.020
So title as well as the section center.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.460
So it may change this one around let's say.

01:38.460 --> 01:46.580
Title added also to the Global's as well as the section center of section and center.

01:46.590 --> 01:52.970
So let's head over to a Global's and one by one we can add these particular styles.

01:53.160 --> 01:59.510
So we had our buttons so we might as well also maybe add the comment of buttons.

01:59.550 --> 02:01.640
So these are gonna be our buttons styles.

02:01.680 --> 02:05.070
But then right after these buttons I'm going to say you know what.

02:05.230 --> 02:08.080
There's going to be some global style first section.

02:08.220 --> 02:14.820
And again remember within the next day she email we had this particular section correct.

02:14.820 --> 02:19.170
So we had a section and also about class.

02:19.170 --> 02:22.480
Now as far as about class we already added the background color.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.610
So what's gonna be with this global section class.

02:25.640 --> 02:29.150
Well we are just going to add a little bit of padding.

02:29.280 --> 02:34.920
We're gonna say padding is going to be top bottom five arms and then zero.

02:34.920 --> 02:38.620
So each and every time we would want to create a new section.

02:38.790 --> 02:44.460
I'm just gonna go grab this global class and just had it for my patterns so that way I don't have to

02:44.460 --> 02:45.760
repeat myself.

02:45.810 --> 02:48.480
Then right after the section we have the title.

02:48.750 --> 02:54.830
So let's write title and as far as title it was wrapped in the title wrapper.

02:54.870 --> 02:58.710
So first let's target title rapper and let's just write.

02:58.710 --> 03:02.280
Margin bottom is going to be two areas.

03:02.370 --> 03:03.050
That's it.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.550
We have right away the margin in the bottom.

03:05.670 --> 03:10.240
Then we also add a title class that's where we have all our text.

03:10.260 --> 03:13.300
So first let's align it in the center.

03:13.360 --> 03:13.830
That's right.

03:13.830 --> 03:20.630
Text align center text transform why don't we set it up as a uppercase.

03:20.670 --> 03:26.660
So all our titles are going to be uppercase font size why don't we change this around a little bit and

03:26.670 --> 03:31.820
let's write font size is going to be two point six harems.

03:31.830 --> 03:38.130
Now here's the question if you would like to set up in fact your heading whatever you have for heading

03:38.490 --> 03:41.250
let's say having two to two point six.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.300
Of course you can do that.

03:42.720 --> 03:47.910
So if I'm going to head over back and I can see that I have this particular heading you could technically

03:47.910 --> 03:51.330
just set this up as a two point six.

03:51.420 --> 03:57.720
Right now in this case I'm just using this for the title because that's just my preference.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.180
You don't have to do it this way.

03:59.280 --> 04:04.860
Course you can use the one in this case I'm just showing that even though you set up already some kind

04:04.860 --> 04:08.770
of height if you would like to override it you can always do that.

04:08.910 --> 04:17.430
And let's also write maybe a bigger letter spacing let's write letter spacing is going to be zero point

04:17.430 --> 04:19.250
five reams.

04:19.470 --> 04:26.570
And then last thing that I would like to do for my title is set up the color for the second text.

04:26.580 --> 04:31.940
Remember we had two of them we had the title that was just our heading to.

04:31.950 --> 04:38.130
But then also we have a subtitle where we just place one piece of our text and I would like to give

04:38.130 --> 04:39.690
it a different color.

04:39.870 --> 04:41.820
So let's write color.

04:42.250 --> 04:46.820
And I'm going to go for primary like so there you go.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.670
That is our title now.

04:48.710 --> 04:55.910
Lastly why don't we set up our section center so our section centers are gonna be our parent containers

04:55.910 --> 04:57.230
for the Flex box.

04:57.410 --> 05:02.960
And as far as the Flex barracks properties we're gonna set them up for each and every section separately

05:03.380 --> 05:05.780
because of course there's going to be different layout.

05:05.900 --> 05:12.920
However as far as the width of the actual section as well as the margin we're going to store this in

05:12.920 --> 05:15.550
the section center generic class.

05:15.740 --> 05:21.760
So that's the reason why after the title I'm gonna write section center.

05:21.800 --> 05:29.140
Let's target the class section center first of all let's set up some kind of with let's say that the

05:29.150 --> 05:34.050
width is going to be 85 percent of the width of the screen.

05:34.070 --> 05:38.430
That's the reason why I'm going to use view widths like so.

05:38.450 --> 05:45.530
And then let's also place some margins so top margin is going to be for our OEM's left and right is

05:45.560 --> 05:46.670
going to be autumn.

05:46.790 --> 05:52.640
That's the reason it's going to be in a center and the bottom one is going to be two areas.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.620
There you go.

05:53.630 --> 06:00.290
Now we have our section center the generic class that we're going to reuse all throughout the project.

06:00.290 --> 06:08.120
Now lastly out out I would like to add some Max with for this particular div because I wouldn't want

06:08.120 --> 06:13.880
it to be bigger than one thousand one hundred and seventy pixels.

06:14.050 --> 06:20.090
Now it clearly cannot see that right now because of course this is a extra small screen size but if

06:20.090 --> 06:25.550
we're going to head over back to our main project in if I'm going to zoom out you're going to notice

06:25.550 --> 06:33.570
that all my sections in fact are not going to be spanning more than eleven hundred seventy pixels.

06:33.570 --> 06:39.140
And the reason for that because we do have the genera class in which we are going to control the width

06:39.560 --> 06:40.830
of our sections.

06:40.880 --> 06:49.280
Now once we're done in fact setting up everything here we're going to head over back to our about and

06:49.280 --> 06:50.720
we're going to keep on working.

06:50.720 --> 06:56.240
And again this was just added for your understanding if you don't want to have these comments by all

06:56.240 --> 07:01.910
means you can delete them now first and foremost notice we have right now the image as well as the info

07:02.400 --> 07:07.200
and first of all for both of them I would like to set up some kind of margin in the bottom.

07:07.210 --> 07:14.280
Now remember the class names about I am G comma so I'm selecting both of them and about info.

07:14.740 --> 07:15.420
OK.

07:15.500 --> 07:20.410
Those were my class names and I'm gonna write margin bottom.

07:20.660 --> 07:23.090
Let's say for our alums.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.840
So now we have the bottom.

07:24.860 --> 07:28.490
Now if that's too big of course you can write three are Ms.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.460
I mean it's really up to you.

07:30.530 --> 07:33.930
I'm going to go with four our alums like so.

07:33.930 --> 07:35.600
And then what else we have.

07:35.620 --> 07:42.610
Well I would like to style in fact this particular heading three guys we have explored and different.

07:43.250 --> 07:50.690
And if you previously noticed when we were working let's say within the hero I added to a heading one

07:50.990 --> 07:51.920
a class.

07:52.160 --> 07:57.680
Now that is my preference where as I'm working I like to in fact set up the classes.

07:57.680 --> 08:03.020
However of course you're not limited that you could let's just say if you know the tearing through is

08:03.020 --> 08:09.470
sitting within the about info you could write something like this where you have about info and then

08:09.470 --> 08:17.410
we're targeting the heading three and then we go with text transform and we just set it up as an uppercase.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.530
We could do it this way.

08:19.610 --> 08:22.650
However my preference is always setting up the classes.

08:22.670 --> 08:29.120
But let's say if you don't like the fact that I keep on adding classes within my email which sometimes

08:29.120 --> 08:35.570
when I'm recording the screen crest I could think that maybe you could find that annoying where maybe

08:35.570 --> 08:41.420
not annoying maybe just a little bit clearer to see where we don't have this class where you just have

08:41.420 --> 08:45.060
to having three and then you have your particular setup.

08:45.530 --> 08:51.440
But I like to in fact add classes so normal let's say for descending 3 I would add some kind of class.

08:51.470 --> 08:56.930
I would say about in full title or something like that because that allows me later on if I change something

08:56.930 --> 09:02.840
if I change let's say my age the amount the element that is being displayed I don't have to change the

09:02.840 --> 09:03.440
class.

09:03.500 --> 09:03.850
Correct.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.450
The class can stay the same.

09:05.450 --> 09:07.450
And those styles are still applied.

09:07.490 --> 09:15.010
Again that is my preference both work of course if I'm selecting this about boring for the having three

09:15.320 --> 09:16.930
then of course I can apply the styles.

09:17.570 --> 09:21.530
So I just wanted to show you that there's multiple ways that we can do that.

09:21.560 --> 09:25.620
So don't think that you specifically need to repeat everything that I'm doing.

09:25.640 --> 09:29.230
Course you could just target the hero and then having one.

09:29.240 --> 09:35.750
Now my preference is to set up these classes because I like working like that better but again that

09:35.750 --> 09:37.370
is just my preference.

09:37.370 --> 09:42.930
And you also probably known as that right away as we added these programs we didn't have to do anything.

09:43.070 --> 09:49.310
And the reason for that is very so this is the benefit of using the global stocks where we already set

09:49.310 --> 09:51.700
up everything pretty much for all the programs.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.770
So unless I would like to change something that's it they're done.

09:54.830 --> 09:55.680
We have the line height.

09:55.690 --> 10:01.690
We have a font weight as well as we have the margin in the bottom which in my case again I find that

10:01.780 --> 10:08.740
much more easier to work because that way I just set it up in one place and that way I don't have to

10:08.860 --> 10:14.740
add the same styling or maybe a little bit different styling for each and every section that will work.

10:15.220 --> 10:21.200
Now let's head over back to the global because remember we had the primary one we had the primary button.

10:21.370 --> 10:25.200
And what I would like to do right now is remember we had a button white.

10:25.210 --> 10:27.970
So we have already most of our styles.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.340
So I'm gonna add comma.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.910
Then as the right primary.

10:32.050 --> 10:37.150
So this particular button of course is going to be hidden right now because we're using the main white.

10:37.150 --> 10:43.630
So I would like to use all of the styles that I already have for the button white but we're going to

10:43.630 --> 10:51.310
change the color and let's add a comment button primary or primary button and then let's just write

10:51.430 --> 10:54.860
for the button primary what I would like.

10:54.860 --> 11:03.770
Well let's start with a background what's right var primary color like so so now I have my background.

11:03.770 --> 11:12.890
Then maybe let's add a color and color is going to be white so far and we're gonna go with white colors

11:13.030 --> 11:25.130
main white and then also white and we add a different border color so let's ride border color and we're

11:25.130 --> 11:30.290
gonna go with the primary one because as we're hovering there's gonna be a little bit of different styling

11:30.980 --> 11:40.110
and then also let's set a button primary hover hover on as far as Button is concerned what we're gonna

11:40.130 --> 11:47.570
do is first of all background is gonna be transparent for my primary button as I'm hovering as well

11:47.570 --> 11:51.770
as the color is gonna change back to a primary color.

11:51.980 --> 11:56.140
So let's write var primary color.

11:56.600 --> 12:03.590
Like so so now as I'm hovering notice my board stays of course the primary color as this is what we

12:03.590 --> 12:05.710
set up within the board color.

12:05.720 --> 12:11.900
But then as we're hovering My background is transparent and again this is the case where I already have

12:11.900 --> 12:13.470
my basic styles.

12:13.550 --> 12:18.200
So if the only thing that I'm changing is in fact the color.

12:18.200 --> 12:24.200
Well I could just say All right so get me whatever styles you already had four button white add them

12:24.200 --> 12:27.200
to button primary and then I'm just gonna override that.

12:27.230 --> 12:33.020
As far as colors are concerned right now if I would want to override let's say pairings or bore or actual

12:33.020 --> 12:34.940
widths and styles of the board.

12:35.090 --> 12:37.390
Of course we can always do that.

12:37.820 --> 12:41.900
So hopefully this gives you an idea of why setting up something globally.

12:42.020 --> 12:45.670
In fact at least in my opinion makes a lot of sense.

12:46.190 --> 12:53.600
Now once we set up our global styling let's head over one more time back to about and let's start dealing

12:53.960 --> 12:56.820
with in fact how we're going to set up our columns.

12:57.530 --> 13:04.730
So we have our about and then I would like to set up a media query where let's say once we get to a

13:04.730 --> 13:09.460
nine hundred and ninety two pixels I would want them side by side.

13:09.990 --> 13:20.850
So remember we had media screen and what's right men with men with and method with is going to be nine

13:20.930 --> 13:23.820
and 92 pixels.

13:23.830 --> 13:32.240
Now let's say that we would want to have about center but again remember that was our div that was in

13:32.240 --> 13:36.410
fact responsible as our parent container.

13:36.410 --> 13:42.170
So we're going to have about center that is going to be our parent element and both of the articles

13:42.230 --> 13:43.280
are children.

13:43.490 --> 13:48.960
That specifically was my setup because that is just going to be easier as we work with Flex box.

13:49.070 --> 13:55.580
So let's write about center first and foremost let's start very simply by creating it as a flex.

13:55.580 --> 14:02.330
Now in this case I am going to in fact zoom out because that way it's going to be easier for me to show

14:02.330 --> 14:05.230
you that I'm going to make my screen size bigger.

14:05.300 --> 14:10.070
And notice once we get to 992 I have them side by side.

14:10.090 --> 14:16.240
Right now it doesn't look pretty but it gets the job done at least initially.

14:16.790 --> 14:23.270
Now once I have them side by side there's some things that I would like to add specifically for both

14:23.270 --> 14:29.000
of my children because now I add a display flex for the parent but I would like to set up first of all

14:29.000 --> 14:32.390
some kind of width for both of the children.

14:32.780 --> 14:34.340
So how do we do that.

14:35.020 --> 14:40.670
Well let's start by targeting both of them and all the time and I know my styles are just coming out

14:41.360 --> 14:44.580
somewhere here in the bottom so I'd like to scroll down a little bit.

14:44.840 --> 14:52.010
Let's say about I am G that is of course my class name and about info some targeting right now both

14:52.070 --> 14:57.440
both of the articles and what I would like to do well I would like to use flex because that is the property

14:57.440 --> 14:58.850
I can use for children.

14:58.850 --> 15:05.580
I wouldn't want them to grow I wouldn't want them to shrink because Roma by default is going to set

15:05.570 --> 15:11.720
up as one so it's going to shrink and then I would like to set them up as half the screen because I

15:11.720 --> 15:16.330
wouldn't want to used to call them layer so it could use something like this.

15:16.460 --> 15:22.520
I could set up 50 percent however I would also like to have some kind of margins.

15:22.730 --> 15:24.710
So why don't we do this instead.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.440
Why don't we write calc function where I'm gonna calculate you know what.

15:28.910 --> 15:36.640
So each of them should be 50 percent minus and then whatever margin I would like to have around and

15:36.740 --> 15:40.030
in my case I'm going to go with two arms again.

15:40.160 --> 15:44.730
You can change the values you can do whatever you want but I'm going to go with two areas.

15:44.870 --> 15:52.340
So now in this case what we're saying is that each of these columns is going to be 50 percent minus

15:52.340 --> 15:52.960
two or three.

15:53.030 --> 15:54.320
So we're calculating.

15:54.350 --> 15:55.580
So that is going to be the way.

15:55.880 --> 16:01.490
Not currently we cannot see that because both of those are applied here all the way in.

16:01.640 --> 16:08.350
And so we have flex and yes the width is less but still they are stacked side by side.

16:08.390 --> 16:13.910
So in order to fix this I'm going to head over back to the parent and I'm going to use justify content

16:14.360 --> 16:15.620
and space between.

16:15.620 --> 16:21.020
Remember that was the property that was pushing the children as far as possible from each other.

16:21.040 --> 16:21.530
Right.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.700
And the moment we do that now we are using this margin.

16:26.180 --> 16:33.290
Now lastly what I would like to set up is margin bottom because remember both of them do have these

16:33.290 --> 16:38.420
margins in the bottom for AMS but once they're sitting side by side Well there's no reason for that

16:38.420 --> 16:39.960
margin to be there right.

16:40.400 --> 16:45.400
So I can say margin bottom and we're going to set a zero.

16:45.410 --> 16:52.550
And lastly I would like to do one more thing where as you're noticing as our screen size is in fact

16:52.550 --> 16:59.270
changing once we have side by side there's multiple scenarios where at some point let's say text is

16:59.270 --> 17:01.450
bigger now and they mean just smaller.

17:01.820 --> 17:07.980
So would want my image to be sitting in fact in the center and then also my image gets bigger.

17:08.120 --> 17:10.890
But I would want my text to be sitting in a center.

17:11.030 --> 17:15.860
And remember we had a property for the child by the name of Aline self.

17:15.920 --> 17:20.740
So since I'm targeting both of them I could just say align self and I could just say center.

17:20.750 --> 17:24.040
So in this case what happens as my screen size gets bigger.

17:24.080 --> 17:29.990
Now since the text is smaller it is sitting side by side with an image or I'm sorry it's in the center

17:29.990 --> 17:30.970
of the image.

17:31.080 --> 17:36.670
Then if I have let's say my image smaller it is still sitting in a center.

17:36.770 --> 17:43.840
As far as the about invoice concerned notice about invoice bigger but the image is sitting in the center.

17:43.880 --> 17:48.320
Now we get that by using this online self in a center.

17:48.830 --> 17:51.570
Now we're almost almost done.

17:51.620 --> 17:58.070
I'm gonna make this again a little bit smaller because I'm going to show you how we can create this

17:58.070 --> 18:05.690
nice effect using the before pseudo element and currently we don't have that as you can see I do have

18:05.690 --> 18:12.520
my image but we don't have that now you know what I'm gonna try in fact make it may be or you're not.

18:12.530 --> 18:14.480
Not probably not going to be possible.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.850
So what I would like to do right now is set up another media query.

18:18.530 --> 18:26.600
And I would want that effect only once I get to a eleven hundred and seventy some say media screen main

18:27.700 --> 18:35.360
with my SO and I'm going to set this up as hundred and one thousand one hundred seventy pixels.

18:35.440 --> 18:40.580
So once we get there what I would like to do well remember my article had a class of what.

18:40.630 --> 18:42.700
Well it has a about image.

18:42.700 --> 18:43.900
Something to say about.

18:43.990 --> 18:44.980
I am G.

18:45.190 --> 18:48.240
And then I'm going to use my before.

18:48.610 --> 18:50.710
So I'm targeting this right now.

18:50.710 --> 18:55.420
And then let's set up a content that is necessary otherwise if we're not going to have this content

18:55.420 --> 19:00.350
properly with even an empty value it's not going to work.

19:00.400 --> 19:06.880
Then let's set up a position absolute position absolute and let's set up some width and height.

19:06.940 --> 19:11.930
And we're also going to notice that we need to set up this about image relative.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.900
And I'm going to show you that in a second.

19:13.930 --> 19:20.210
So let's say for my before I'd like to use a width of hundred percent.

19:20.210 --> 19:24.620
Like so height of also hundred percent.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.680
And let's add right away the border.

19:27.130 --> 19:28.130
So let's write.

19:28.120 --> 19:38.300
Borders an hour working with our pseudo element zero point five our MS solid var and primary color.

19:38.320 --> 19:43.010
Now again I'm not gonna do that on a bigger or smaller screen size.

19:43.060 --> 19:49.210
I'm gonna show you right away on a bigger one and you notice right now how in fact my width and height.

19:49.270 --> 19:54.450
Well it's not using my image container in fact it is using something else.

19:54.510 --> 19:55.110
Right.

19:55.300 --> 20:03.610
And in order to fix that since we are using for this before the positional absolute since our before

20:03.610 --> 20:10.180
is in fact sitting before the content within the about I am G and please remember when we work with

20:10.510 --> 20:13.200
a pseudo element before and after.

20:13.330 --> 20:18.370
In fact what we're talking about is the content of that element.

20:18.370 --> 20:24.880
So that's the reason why we cannot set it up as far as the image is concerned because image by itself

20:24.940 --> 20:26.550
is already the content.

20:26.560 --> 20:32.950
So what we're saying here for this particular article before adding content I would like to set up my

20:33.190 --> 20:41.630
before pseudo element and since I wouldn't want to be stretching like so I'm going to have to go back

20:41.780 --> 20:43.220
and I'm going to say like this.

20:43.220 --> 20:52.100
Where about our energy is in fact going to be a position relative so let's write position relative and

20:52.100 --> 20:56.090
now in fact it works as a parent container.

20:56.090 --> 21:02.420
So now our content absolute is in fact relative to our container.

21:03.130 --> 21:09.350
That's number one and also you notice right away how we don't have any issues with a positioning with

21:09.350 --> 21:10.580
a border box.

21:10.580 --> 21:16.040
Because remember when we worked all the way in the beginning when we set up our global stars we also

21:16.040 --> 21:19.430
right away did the same thing for before and after.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.530
So that's the reason why we have no issues whatsoever.

21:22.580 --> 21:25.320
We just added a nice border name.

21:25.700 --> 21:30.920
Now what I would like to do right now is in fact move that border a little bit and since we are using

21:30.920 --> 21:39.410
the position absolute again Let's scroll down and let's head over back to about image before pseudo

21:39.410 --> 21:47.690
element and let's say that I would like to position it on a top negative one point five arms and not

21:47.690 --> 21:52.510
15 but one point five grams as well as the left one as well.

21:53.090 --> 21:57.290
So top left is going to be negative one point five.

21:57.800 --> 22:01.520
Let's say that and notice everything works really well.

22:01.550 --> 22:10.550
However there is an issue and the issue is that our stack because as you're noticing right now we have

22:10.640 --> 22:16.400
our stack or and it has changed a little bit around because normally we would things like that.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.980
So we have our about image before correct.

22:20.390 --> 22:24.860
So that in fact should be sitting underneath our image correct.

22:24.860 --> 22:30.500
Because if I'm going to head over back to our indexation Mel you're going to notice we have are about

22:30.620 --> 22:35.690
I M G and then we are placing before the content and only then we have the image.

22:35.870 --> 22:41.330
So technically image should be sitting on top of our before element.

22:41.330 --> 22:49.190
Now the problem is or not the problem maybe the setup is there very simply where if we add this position

22:49.250 --> 22:58.220
relative right now to or about i g in fact what we're doing is the stack or is that the about I am G

22:58.520 --> 23:01.000
is in fact sitting on top of it.

23:01.280 --> 23:05.770
Because we have position absolute we have position relative here.

23:05.810 --> 23:14.120
So since our before in fact has this position absolute Well it is in a stack over in front of our image.

23:14.150 --> 23:20.660
Now in order to change that Well very simply we just say about and then remember we had a class of about

23:20.660 --> 23:24.040
photo and then also let's add on this position of relative.

23:24.530 --> 23:31.990
Now what is going to happen that our element the before element is going to sit behind the image.

23:32.420 --> 23:40.770
Because again that is our stack order where within the indexation AML well about image is first correct

23:41.240 --> 23:43.790
and then we have the about photo.

23:43.790 --> 23:49.580
So of course this is gonna be sitting in front of the about image.

23:49.680 --> 23:53.540
In fact that one is coming after the about image.

23:53.540 --> 24:00.710
So once we set up our photo as position relative now we're back to our normal stack order where we have

24:00.800 --> 24:06.670
our element the pseudo before element that is sitting behind our photo.

24:07.010 --> 24:09.320
And that should do it for our about section.
