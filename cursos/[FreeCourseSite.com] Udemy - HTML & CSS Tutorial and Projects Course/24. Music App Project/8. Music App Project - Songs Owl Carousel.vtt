WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:03.280
So what we have so far is here like this.

00:03.290 --> 00:05.180
And so this is going to be a wrap.

00:05.520 --> 00:09.420
And here you can see that this is going to be our songs right now.

00:09.420 --> 00:12.130
What we need to do here is Ousley at the hour.

00:12.190 --> 00:12.800
All right.

00:13.050 --> 00:17.300
So we need to go on here to a Google All right.

00:17.300 --> 00:23.190
All right our curso here and we right away go here to the home page.

00:23.520 --> 00:29.040
And the first thing right away we can just downloaded right now and downloading over here and then we

00:29.040 --> 00:31.320
can go to the documentation.

00:31.500 --> 00:31.880
Right.

00:31.890 --> 00:34.340
And over here they say what we would want right.

00:34.560 --> 00:41.330
So we need a theme default he says all theme default mensis is right.

00:41.420 --> 00:44.200
And so here we have a installation right.

00:44.210 --> 00:50.370
So for the installation this is what we should include in our head element right.

00:50.410 --> 00:52.290
And here this is going to be the javascript.

00:52.290 --> 00:56.310
Now they also require a query because this is a Jake replugging.

00:56.580 --> 00:59.450
But we already have the Jack wiring right now.

00:59.460 --> 01:05.380
The thing that hear about all thean default I mean you technically do not need to include it.

01:06.030 --> 01:07.800
Technically you can write it on here like this.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.370
Right.

01:08.400 --> 01:14.520
And I remember when we were writing our age T.M. we actually included the owl theme.

01:14.530 --> 01:20.200
And so if we went over here to this song center I actually had a theme.

01:20.430 --> 01:21.690
So let's go here.

01:21.780 --> 01:24.240
And this was the song list.

01:24.300 --> 01:26.820
So what we would need is a song.

01:27.110 --> 01:33.600
So let me scroll down right and you can see or hear yourself in this all thean gives you hear these

01:33.600 --> 01:35.910
nice navigation.

01:36.180 --> 01:39.230
So that's the reason why we're adding this owl theme.

01:39.360 --> 01:45.150
But again it's not necessarily great but if you wanted the buttons right this is what you should do.

01:45.200 --> 01:48.600
Right so here let's first actually get it right.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.710
So where is the downloads.

01:50.810 --> 01:53.060
And this is going to be our curso.

01:53.450 --> 02:01.270
We're doing this then what I'm going to do here is I can just grab this folder and put it on desktop

02:01.290 --> 02:07.040
right so I can minimize this for now right so it can get everything what you need and on here what I

02:07.040 --> 02:10.380
would want is a distribution here.

02:10.590 --> 02:13.340
And then we have a search right now.

02:13.450 --> 02:17.320
Here we have all theme default success.

02:17.460 --> 02:25.500
So we grabbed this guy then we would need a mean see here so Mincey says.

02:25.560 --> 02:29.960
So we're going to grab this one this one over here like this.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.330
And then we would want to go back and see or hear this our current Just so we're also going to have.

02:36.500 --> 02:41.480
So I'm going to close this one up not create a new file folder and I'm going to call it this.

02:41.540 --> 02:42.990
Oh.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.480
All here let's grab these files right.

02:45.510 --> 02:48.500
So all three files are here.

02:48.570 --> 02:52.610
Grab them and then we're going to actually place them in our music app.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.400
And then we can actually do it if we want.

02:55.410 --> 02:56.150
Right.

02:56.250 --> 03:02.580
So we can just move it to the trash and the trash or going to go back to our techs that are now we need

03:02.580 --> 03:03.840
to actually link it.

03:03.860 --> 03:04.240
All right.

03:04.260 --> 03:06.330
So this is going to be all.

03:06.900 --> 03:08.920
So let's say all the way I'm on top right.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.880
Where's little head and foot.

03:10.880 --> 03:16.080
Last one was we're going to say over here and on here we're going to have two links.

03:16.260 --> 03:18.520
So the first one is going to be at all.

03:18.620 --> 03:25.730
And this is going to be a carer so men see a sense then after that we're going to have another one not

03:25.900 --> 03:26.620
like.

03:26.650 --> 03:33.550
All right so let's go Mac or we're going to say on your link and this is going to be again a whole hole

03:34.030 --> 03:37.340
more here and you can see that I made a mistake here.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.310
So this is going to be a whole whole.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.880
And this is going to be themed defaults.

03:43.070 --> 03:44.480
Yes that's right.

03:44.490 --> 03:50.280
So now that we have a theme now and next one would we would want is or here in the bottom.

03:50.350 --> 03:53.120
And so this is going to be a genius right.

03:53.190 --> 03:56.280
So we're going to write on here before the script.

03:56.310 --> 04:03.530
We're going to write all J.S. Right and now we are going to have a script and we're going to press time

04:03.650 --> 04:06.500
and the source is also going to be out.

04:06.620 --> 04:14.780
So I'm going to go today I'll add on here are so many us now did we have them connected now that everything

04:14.780 --> 04:17.640
is working you could see my songs actually disappear.

04:17.660 --> 04:18.460
Right.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.850
Because it has started to work.

04:21.850 --> 04:27.350
However we need to actually had the code that's actually running this way and the easiest way how to

04:27.350 --> 04:29.160
actually start running the whole converso.

04:29.290 --> 04:33.870
So we're going to go back all here and you see or here we have them.

04:33.930 --> 04:34.530
Right.

04:34.710 --> 04:39.230
I mean we have all kinds of demos but we're going to right away go with the basic one and it's all going

04:39.230 --> 04:40.530
to go to the basic one.

04:40.820 --> 04:45.850
And basically what we need to do is in our script write we need to add this code.

04:46.250 --> 04:49.470
You know here we're going to say oh you're doing this right.

04:49.470 --> 04:51.440
That we would want this code.

04:51.860 --> 04:57.920
And when I'm going to say here is I'm going to copy this one right and we're going to go back over here

04:58.370 --> 04:59.930
and we're here in the script.

04:59.930 --> 05:00.520
All right.

05:00.530 --> 05:05.030
We're going to copy and paste this code now or here what I'm going to do is I'm going to change it.

05:05.060 --> 05:08.120
Technically you can run this this way right.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.440
Everything would be fine.

05:09.440 --> 05:17.150
However if there's going to be multiple carousels actually what you would want is songs and center right.

05:17.270 --> 05:23.390
So basically you'd want to have a class that you would want to target and then you would want at our

05:23.390 --> 05:24.280
cars.

05:24.360 --> 05:24.680
Right.

05:24.860 --> 05:28.990
And we're going to go over these ones in the second round let's just start running our cars.

05:29.030 --> 05:29.570
Right.

05:29.770 --> 05:33.660
You can see or hear now my actual car running on here like this.

05:33.710 --> 05:34.210
Right.

05:34.220 --> 05:35.680
So everything is working.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.240
Now let's go back here to indexation.

05:38.270 --> 05:40.570
First of all understand where we actually added.

05:40.610 --> 05:41.300
Right.

05:41.390 --> 05:46.300
So if we're going to go back over here right you see or hear the syntax that they would want.

05:46.310 --> 05:46.930
Right.

05:46.970 --> 05:53.240
So we have the day of the day of the class and then we have to our carrousel classes in our cars on

05:53.240 --> 05:54.090
our team.

05:54.170 --> 05:56.900
So if we're going to go back over here this is in the set up that they were want.

05:56.900 --> 05:57.710
Right.

05:57.710 --> 06:01.850
You need to have a div with our curso and our theme.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.180
And then all these divs are actually going to be children.

06:06.430 --> 06:06.840
Right.

06:07.010 --> 06:09.720
And once you set up the carousel then it starts running.

06:10.010 --> 06:15.430
Now whenever we are selecting right we can select just a regular car carso.

06:15.640 --> 06:20.570
However if you're going to have multiple of them right you need to have distinguish right you need to

06:20.570 --> 06:22.100
distinguish between.

06:22.100 --> 06:28.200
So therefore in our script I'm selecting the songs center right not the carousel.

06:28.280 --> 06:31.730
And then I'm adding this out carousel to the song center.

06:31.790 --> 06:34.970
And this is the look that we get over here right.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.620
So after that what kind of options are these.

06:37.620 --> 06:37.820
Right.

06:37.820 --> 06:40.760
We have loop and we have margin than we have now.

06:41.090 --> 06:42.100
And on here like this right.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.390
Then we have a response.

06:43.520 --> 06:50.170
What responsa means is that as the screen size changes so does the items all right.

06:50.210 --> 06:56.080
So on a zero we're going to have one then moment and goes to 600 and it's going to be three then on

06:56.100 --> 06:57.870
here thousand is going to be five.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.630
Now obviously you can change these.

06:59.690 --> 07:01.040
Right we are going to leave.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.690
The way it is the basic one right.

07:02.870 --> 07:04.440
But you can obviously change that.

07:04.460 --> 07:06.240
And where would you find it.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.240
Where would you find how to do that actually.

07:08.270 --> 07:08.770
Right.

07:08.810 --> 07:13.320
So if you're going to go to documents I mean you know I'm going to go back to options.

07:13.730 --> 07:16.390
Now these are the options that you're writing in the object right.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.630
Items are typed.

07:17.630 --> 07:21.170
Number three right margin type number.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.550
The fourth one.

07:22.550 --> 07:27.830
Now we're going to get not going to go over them because there's a lot of them to Covenant's can be

07:27.830 --> 07:29.540
coarse on its own right.

07:29.570 --> 07:31.320
What are you going to look for is one thing.

07:31.430 --> 07:33.140
And this is actually going to be smarts.

07:33.200 --> 07:33.920
Right.

07:33.950 --> 07:35.460
So this is going to be smart.

07:35.700 --> 07:41.200
Well here you can see that this is going to be type number and the folds to 50 and spots basically tells

07:41.210 --> 07:44.830
how long we're actually how long the carousel was working.

07:44.870 --> 07:45.290
Right.

07:45.530 --> 07:46.820
So we're going to go here.

07:46.970 --> 07:50.730
We're going to place a comma smart speed here.

07:50.860 --> 07:52.190
This is smart.

07:52.450 --> 07:53.570
I will say speed.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.930
And I'm going to say let's say 4000.

07:56.060 --> 07:58.510
Which again stands for four seconds basically.

07:58.580 --> 07:59.200
Right.

07:59.210 --> 08:01.650
So if we say this see what happens.

08:01.650 --> 08:04.160
Right now the carousel is moving slower.

08:04.340 --> 08:06.370
So each time it is going to take four seconds.

08:06.560 --> 08:10.680
So this is how we can actually experiment with all these options right.

08:10.700 --> 08:14.240
You can check out what is fluid speed out of play or anything like that.

08:14.240 --> 08:14.770
Right.

08:14.840 --> 08:19.900
So again I'm going to leave it for you to look at it but this would be the basic thing right.

08:19.910 --> 08:24.080
You just go back to the object and you right out of play whether I want or not.

08:24.080 --> 08:24.370
Right.

08:24.380 --> 08:27.680
You can see by default it's false but you can actually set it.

08:27.970 --> 08:29.360
Let's say draw if you want.

08:29.390 --> 08:29.880
Right.

08:29.990 --> 08:32.440
So this is how we would get them ready.

08:32.450 --> 08:33.770
Right now we're here.

08:33.770 --> 08:38.230
Let's look at these guys and you can see that right now we have the colors but they're not the best

08:38.230 --> 08:38.620
right.

08:38.780 --> 08:39.040
No.

08:39.140 --> 08:41.180
Here you can see the finished product range.

08:41.360 --> 08:45.590
We have all here these ones are going to be orange right now as we're hovering black.

08:45.620 --> 08:51.740
And the items are going to be changing and also the same stands stands out here for these guys right.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.490
That's what I'm going to do here.

08:53.630 --> 08:54.390
We're going to go back to.

08:54.390 --> 08:55.530
All right.

08:55.670 --> 09:02.920
We find our theme the fall assess like this and then this is where we actually change it right.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.290
So we have all right.

09:04.300 --> 09:11.380
So the first one is all right first color and we're going to write is just don't check what we had.

09:11.380 --> 09:11.890
Right.

09:11.890 --> 09:16.270
So we had a white with a orange background.

09:16.300 --> 09:16.940
Right.

09:16.980 --> 09:20.110
So the white can stain or her hair will get right.

09:20.110 --> 09:29.860
And this is going to be EF 1 5 0 to 5 right then really you can see that we have a rule of when we're

09:29.860 --> 09:32.600
actually hovering and it's all over.

09:32.830 --> 09:36.110
So what changed this 1 to 1 9 1 9 1 9.

09:36.280 --> 09:36.770
Right.

09:36.980 --> 09:39.980
And let's look for where is the actual color.

09:39.990 --> 09:40.680
Right.

09:40.750 --> 09:43.810
Where is the color not getting the color right now right.

09:43.810 --> 09:46.600
So we have background background here right.

09:46.600 --> 09:51.720
We're going to go here and we're going to say this is going to be say what we had right now.

09:51.740 --> 09:53.020
You know what we had a different way.

09:53.020 --> 10:01.410
We had a background was 1 9 1 9 1 9 and this one was actually EF 1 5 0 2 5 0.

10:01.450 --> 10:02.270
That's right.

10:02.290 --> 10:05.850
So what happens is as I'm hovering You can see that it's different.

10:05.920 --> 10:08.430
And also let's change these dots on here.

10:08.470 --> 10:12.270
So we're going to go back over here and see or hear here.

10:12.310 --> 10:13.830
That's right.

10:13.840 --> 10:19.870
And you're here to see that once we're hovering right so folded up Magro right away.

10:20.190 --> 10:25.150
Let's say that we're going to have a like 1 1 9 1 9 1 9.

10:25.180 --> 10:33.430
However when we were hovering back when we were going to change it to orange so I have 1 5 0 2 5 and

10:33.430 --> 10:40.280
this is how we can actually change here to this custom navigation and let's say this.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.800
And let's actually go to our music up right.

10:42.820 --> 10:43.950
We don't have it yet.

10:44.160 --> 10:47.450
You can see that because we didn't actually download it right.

10:47.470 --> 10:49.190
We didn't we refresh the page.

10:49.490 --> 10:53.980
Well we refresh it and sure enough you can see that we have it over here right.

10:54.090 --> 10:55.440
And I can see that it's working.

10:55.440 --> 11:02.500
We have song and most an artist and as a hover you can see that what we have right and also notice that

11:02.560 --> 11:09.460
once we have are all curso and what happens is once I press it over here right it doesn't stop or hear

11:09.460 --> 11:13.860
what they write because right now you can see that our Kowsar was actually pushing.

11:14.090 --> 11:19.990
Right now we have actually Max with working right before that it's data nany.

11:20.170 --> 11:29.110
The moment we added a whole curso it actually pushed all the way to 100 great so our with staes hundred.

11:29.290 --> 11:31.120
It doesn't push out on the page.

11:31.210 --> 11:33.100
However it doesn't stay at 80 right.

11:33.110 --> 11:38.200
So that's what I was saying to that whole carrousel use is a absolute positioning.

11:38.270 --> 11:38.700
Right.

11:38.770 --> 11:45.520
So therefore before if we stayed at 80 right even though our max with 100 right now with all carrousel

11:45.520 --> 11:48.920
pushes out right but it doesn't go beyond the page.

11:49.150 --> 11:52.930
And this is going to be it for this project and I hope you guys enjoyed it.
