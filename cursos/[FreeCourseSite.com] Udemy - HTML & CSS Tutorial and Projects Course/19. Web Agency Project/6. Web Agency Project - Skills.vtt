WEBVTT

00:00.690 --> 00:04.930
And the next section we're going to be building we're here this is going to be the skills.

00:05.030 --> 00:05.300
Right.

00:05.300 --> 00:07.720
And like I said this is going to be responsive.

00:07.780 --> 00:12.980
And so as you can see that it changes from four columns here and then it's going to be two and then

00:12.980 --> 00:14.750
the smaller screen is going to be one.

00:14.750 --> 00:15.310
All right.

00:15.350 --> 00:21.740
So let's go to our indexation here now or here and open it up and we're going to say that this is going

00:21.740 --> 00:23.110
to be the banner.

00:23.210 --> 00:28.780
So here we're going to say this is going to be Skills section right skills section and we're hoping

00:28.830 --> 00:31.260
to say this is going to be the end of school section.

00:31.320 --> 00:35.990
So let's cover this right over here and of skills.

00:36.150 --> 00:36.770
Right.

00:36.770 --> 00:42.470
And what we're all going to have here is we're going to say this is going to be section here like this

00:42.470 --> 00:44.590
one idea of skills.

00:44.650 --> 00:45.140
Right.

00:45.380 --> 00:51.380
And once we have this we're going to say Dave this is going to be skills container right.

00:51.590 --> 00:56.570
Once we have that we're going to have a skills item which is actually going to be in an article I'm

00:56.900 --> 01:02.440
sorry I'm going to write an article and this is going to have a class of skills.

01:02.540 --> 01:08.800
I had them you know in this once we our first article we're going to have a to us and we're going to

01:08.800 --> 01:14.870
have four or here we're going to say this is going to be code like this and then we're going to have

01:14.930 --> 01:21.470
a heading here like this one to say this is going to be heading one and this is going to be a class

01:22.250 --> 01:24.550
actually of code and it's all going on right.

01:24.560 --> 01:27.580
I'm sorry this is going to have actual content of code right.

01:27.600 --> 01:33.200
So on what I write or hear code and press time over here and I would have had it one and now would want

01:33.290 --> 01:34.900
a platting right.

01:34.940 --> 01:40.640
So we're going to write I'm sorry pop paragraph sorry paragraph and on here I'm going to say this is

01:40.640 --> 01:43.570
going to be a long term so I'm going to insert some dummy text.

01:43.640 --> 01:46.330
So give me like 15 words or something like that right.

01:46.520 --> 01:51.590
So yeah I'm going to press typing on we have a paragraph and then the next thing that we would want

01:51.590 --> 01:56.550
to do is obviously create more skills items like this.

01:56.570 --> 01:57.130
Right.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.650
So what I'm going to do over here I'm going to say this for now.

02:00.740 --> 02:08.090
Say this and then we're going to do is grab this article and say this is going to be hard to go and

02:08.090 --> 02:09.540
this is going to be the end of article.

02:09.560 --> 02:09.800
Right.

02:09.800 --> 02:15.630
So we can just see better where we have the new article so it's easier for us to work.

02:15.710 --> 02:17.250
And of article.

02:17.690 --> 02:19.700
And then let's just grab this right.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.320
So we're going to have one two three.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.350
All right so now we have four of them.

02:24.350 --> 02:28.640
And what we're going to write on here the next one is going to be file text.

02:28.640 --> 02:32.200
All right so we're going to say this is going to be documented.

02:32.270 --> 02:39.530
So let's find where the second one going to say this is going to be a documented and this is going to

02:39.530 --> 02:49.350
be a file here file text both here and this then we're going to have all read guys going to you for

02:49.400 --> 02:53.250
map all map.

02:53.630 --> 02:56.460
And this is going to be optimized.

02:56.620 --> 03:00.800
We're going to find this is going to be optimized optimized

03:03.240 --> 03:06.880
minds over here probably it's correct.

03:06.890 --> 03:08.010
Right optimized.

03:08.180 --> 03:10.850
And the last one is going to be a desktop.

03:11.280 --> 03:18.070
So we're going to say stop and then we're going to write code and it's going to be different.

03:18.290 --> 03:25.450
It's going to be written right here like this and we're done with our page now and we're ready to move

03:25.450 --> 03:33.060
on to a really good set of skills section.

03:33.590 --> 03:34.170
Right.

03:34.260 --> 03:38.550
And really can you just go ahead to make sure this is styling.

03:38.890 --> 03:40.460
So we have the main sites.

03:40.520 --> 03:46.610
And obviously once we're done with the banner we need to make a comment and this is going to be actually

03:46.640 --> 03:48.420
a skills section right.

03:48.440 --> 03:56.910
So again we got to war here and create a comment and we're going to say this is going to be Skills section.

03:56.910 --> 04:01.110
I don't know if we can create hashtags we can i mean really depends.

04:01.150 --> 04:05.340
Just sometimes those hashtags actually help you to see everything better right.

04:05.420 --> 04:10.580
Or here we're going to scroll down right so we can see that in this size right and we're going to start

04:10.580 --> 04:12.010
styling here.

04:12.200 --> 04:17.310
We're going to say this is going to be skills first and then we're going to have a few things right.

04:17.430 --> 04:22.660
There's going to be Patti and the padding is actually going to be 60 pixels or you doing this sort of

04:22.670 --> 04:25.470
bottom and actually on the sides we're going to leave it zero.

04:25.470 --> 04:30.770
All right then we'll have a background color and the background color over here is going to be this

04:31.060 --> 04:34.280
B E B B B.

04:34.400 --> 04:38.060
And then it can be seven a 4 right.

04:38.150 --> 04:41.310
So let me just make sure that I have this color over here.

04:41.510 --> 04:44.490
B B C Yeah that's the great one right.

04:44.510 --> 04:47.100
I was just kind of confused when I put it in there or not.

04:47.130 --> 04:53.050
All right so now we have a skills that we would want a skills container.

04:53.120 --> 05:01.090
So here we get the right skills container and what we have over here is going to be a Mac with or hear

05:01.090 --> 05:06.170
like this I'm not going to say this is going to be ninety five wii you.

05:06.240 --> 05:09.260
Right so this is going to be for a few.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.270
When is horizontally right.

05:11.440 --> 05:16.600
So what we're doing or here we're just setting it so it doesn't expand more like we're just creating

05:16.600 --> 05:17.340
a little padding.

05:17.380 --> 05:17.900
Right.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.700
We're also good right away going to center.

05:19.750 --> 05:20.320
Right.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.580
Some say margin.

05:21.580 --> 05:24.430
0 auto right.

05:24.560 --> 05:28.760
So I can see that the whole container actually contains all these articles.

05:28.870 --> 05:34.600
I'm just putting in the center and we're saying that we don't want it to be more than 95 or 95 should

05:34.600 --> 05:40.400
be the max we're all going to say skills and we're going to say who I am and what should we do with

05:40.460 --> 05:41.410
the item right.

05:41.410 --> 05:47.380
So here we're going to set x to y line center and so that in the center margin and margin is going to

05:47.380 --> 05:49.770
be only the top and or here's zero.

05:49.810 --> 05:50.400
All right.

05:50.410 --> 05:52.510
So you can see that we just created these margins.

05:52.510 --> 05:57.880
This was the most important part for us on the small screen so they're not stacking into each other.

05:57.880 --> 05:58.670
Right.

05:58.720 --> 06:05.720
And then we're going to have a skills item phantasm that's all going to go here and the same skills

06:06.890 --> 06:09.920
and I'm going to say phantasm.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.650
And what should happen right.

06:11.650 --> 06:16.660
So here we're going to say font size and this is going to be 60 pixels and so we're going to make them

06:16.660 --> 06:25.920
big and we're going to have color let's say hash tag or here of 1 2 1 9 1 7 1 6 right.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.800
So can I make them black.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.700
They're going to have a letter spacing right.

06:30.700 --> 06:33.780
And we're going to say letter spacing one pixel.

06:33.860 --> 06:39.300
So we're going to make them a little bit less stacked together right here.

06:39.340 --> 06:44.880
This is going to be skills and we're going to see them and we're going to have heading one right.

06:44.980 --> 06:46.390
And what should happen.

06:46.390 --> 06:49.650
We're going to say this is going to be fun size here.

06:49.680 --> 06:53.320
It's not fun this play font size.

06:53.320 --> 07:00.850
And we're going to say font size is going to be 30 pixels right over here to me and we're going to have

07:00.940 --> 07:07.530
a letter spacing of two pixels or spacing two pixels.

07:07.750 --> 07:13.980
Then we're going to have a actual margin and you can see actually over here this was completely unnecessary.

07:14.010 --> 07:16.920
No one was putting a letter spacing or here right.

07:16.920 --> 07:23.280
It doesn't make sense spacing I needed or here for my heading and then I'm going to have a margin of

07:23.340 --> 07:29.890
no real margin is going to be 30 pixels and zero or here and the color right and what is going to be

07:29.890 --> 07:34.440
the color this is going to be hashtag e 6 8.

07:34.650 --> 07:37.860
And that is going to be EF 2 EF 2.

07:38.240 --> 07:45.640
So we're going to make this call and then we're going to say text transform text transform I'm not going

07:45.640 --> 07:48.460
to say uppercase or this.

07:48.550 --> 07:54.970
Now that we have it uppercase we have a few three more rules to actually create.

07:55.040 --> 07:59.880
First it's going to be for a paragraph and then the next to is actually as we're making it responsive

08:00.140 --> 08:07.630
Let's or here we're going to say skills and say item and paragraph and what should happen.

08:07.630 --> 08:14.410
So first we're going to say to do with sexual it should be only 75 percent to 75 percent.

08:14.690 --> 08:17.350
Then again we need to make the trek with the margin right.

08:17.350 --> 08:21.000
So we're actually sitting in the center and then we're going to have a color.

08:21.100 --> 08:21.460
Right.

08:21.460 --> 08:28.760
And the color is going to be hash tag e 0 he and they're all going to have to the be right.

08:28.930 --> 08:34.020
So now we have a color and then we would want a medium screens for responsiveness right.

08:34.270 --> 08:41.230
So we're going to say it's going to be a year and screen or here and then we're going to say hand and

08:41.230 --> 08:52.590
for the men with white men with over here like this and then we're going to start with 576 576 pixels.

08:52.810 --> 08:58.160
And then what we're going to say is we would want to create all these brackets right.

08:58.220 --> 09:03.790
And we're going to say this is going to be for the skills container container and then we're going to

09:03.790 --> 09:11.350
say that this is going to be displayed red red here and we're going to say great template columns on

09:11.350 --> 09:16.630
it's own grade red template template columns.

09:16.630 --> 09:21.190
Right now we're here we're going to write and this is going to be one fraction and one fraction.

09:21.190 --> 09:26.440
So basically what we're saying is let's just divided actually in half right.

09:26.620 --> 09:29.080
Exactly and have just divided and be done with it.

09:29.110 --> 09:29.690
Right.

09:29.740 --> 09:34.520
And also if we want right away we can add an actual grid map right.

09:34.560 --> 09:38.690
So we're going to say that we're just grid or here call them gap.

09:38.920 --> 09:43.720
And so we need to find this gap and this is basically what is the gap going to be between the columns

09:43.720 --> 09:44.300
right.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.240
We're going to say let's say something like wanting him.

09:46.240 --> 09:46.540
Right.

09:46.540 --> 09:51.910
So you can see or hear you can start practicing different actually measurements right.

09:51.910 --> 09:56.470
Not just pixels but this is the new one the fraction right which pretty much divides it.

09:56.470 --> 09:56.990
Right.

09:57.190 --> 10:04.000
And here this is what he writes It's not that Newbert anyway or here would want to do is actually create

10:04.000 --> 10:04.940
another one right.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.260
So this is where we are starting from the smaller screen.

10:08.260 --> 10:08.840
Right.

10:08.860 --> 10:15.520
So if I save this one right and if I refresh over here this web agency right now you can see right now

10:15.760 --> 10:17.240
this is what I'm going to have right.

10:17.410 --> 10:21.070
But as I'm going to the bigger screen this is not what I want right.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.640
I obviously would want a four of them right.

10:23.800 --> 10:29.520
So what's going to happen is if I go back over here right I'm going to change the rule.

10:29.550 --> 10:30.290
Right.

10:30.460 --> 10:33.730
And we're not as much just going to change it or going out a new one.

10:33.820 --> 10:35.750
So there was a first media screen.

10:35.920 --> 10:36.330
Right.

10:36.490 --> 10:42.810
And this one is going to be for a nine and two I had to go back on here and say nine any two.

10:42.880 --> 10:48.640
And instead this time even one fraction right what we're going to say this is going to be able to use

10:48.700 --> 10:50.760
a repeat method right.

10:50.770 --> 10:51.640
Repeat.

10:51.760 --> 10:58.610
No we are all going to write and we would want a four times repeat and one for action right here one

10:58.630 --> 10:59.350
for action.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.450
And this is another way how to write it.

11:01.570 --> 11:05.720
We could have written one fraction one fraction one fraction one fraction right.

11:05.890 --> 11:11.610
But we can also shorten by just writing repeat then many times and what kind of amount.

11:11.620 --> 11:11.950
Right.

11:11.950 --> 11:16.220
So or hear what I'm going to do is make the grade gap a little bit less.

11:16.360 --> 11:20.830
So let's say I'm going to make something like five pixels just for for fun of it.

11:20.830 --> 11:22.690
In the beginning and then we'll see how it looks like.

11:22.690 --> 11:23.290
Right.

11:23.290 --> 11:29.020
So let's refresh and then we go back over here and I can see that now we have four of them right.

11:29.020 --> 11:31.070
And this is how they're actually going to look.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.220
And this is going to be it for this section.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.840
And now we are ready to move on to the next section.
