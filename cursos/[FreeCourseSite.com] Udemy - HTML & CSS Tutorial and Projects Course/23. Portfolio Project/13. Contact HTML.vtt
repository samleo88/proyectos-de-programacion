00:00.150 --> 00:04.770
The next section we're going to be building is actually going to be the contact section.

00:04.770 --> 00:10.950
So here we're going to have a name and email textarea And over here this would be a button.

00:10.980 --> 00:13.940
So let's go again to the text that are.

00:14.110 --> 00:16.220
Let's go to the next thing.

00:16.290 --> 00:21.920
Now more here and let's find where is actually the end of our last section on here and here.

00:21.960 --> 00:28.920
This was the end of the project or we're all going to say that this would be a contact contact section

00:29.270 --> 00:35.970
we're here and we're going to create this a and contact section and of contact section or here in the

00:35.970 --> 00:36.670
section.

00:36.660 --> 00:43.680
As always we're going to start with a section with a class of contact here then what we would want is

00:43.680 --> 00:44.680
a title.

00:44.700 --> 00:48.380
So we're going to we're going to search for a section title.

00:48.410 --> 00:54.870
So are you going to write section title here and you can see that I I'm going to find a service style.

00:54.960 --> 01:00.960
So we're going to say I'm going to just copy and paste this again here and we're going to go all the

01:00.960 --> 01:03.760
way down to our last section or here.

01:03.930 --> 01:09.230
And I was going to copy and paste this title and they're all going to change some things around so here

01:09.240 --> 01:11.980
I'm going to say this is not going to be services.

01:12.090 --> 01:15.350
This is actually going to be contact here.

01:15.480 --> 01:22.170
So let's say I read or here you can see that I have my compact section now once we're done with a title

01:22.590 --> 01:26.990
then the next one is going to be contact on your center.

01:27.180 --> 01:29.690
So again this is going to be for sundering.

01:29.730 --> 01:34.850
And then once we have any contact center then the next one we're going to have a form.

01:34.860 --> 01:36.890
So here we're going to have a form.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.830
So I'm going to create it for a moment.

01:38.890 --> 01:43.980
We're also going to delay the action because there's not going to be any action now in the form we're

01:43.980 --> 01:47.730
going to start with a comment or form at all here.

01:47.760 --> 01:53.580
So this is going to be our first to put on here and or here we're going to say that this is going to

01:53.580 --> 01:54.690
be form letter.

01:54.720 --> 02:01.800
So it's also going to be a day of off contact or year and two scores better.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.440
All right.

02:02.520 --> 02:07.980
So this is going to be the class we're all going to have an input now the input is actually going to

02:07.980 --> 02:09.880
be taxed more here.

02:10.050 --> 02:13.110
We're going to leave the name and ID and over here.

02:13.380 --> 02:16.200
We're going to have a placeholder and we're going to say name.

02:16.380 --> 02:18.520
And also we would want to create a class.

02:18.640 --> 02:24.020
So we're here we're going to say that this is going to be class contact here and name.

02:24.270 --> 02:28.020
So this is going to be our class for our input on here.

02:28.150 --> 02:33.580
And you can see in the bottom this is going to be on now also still in the header.

02:33.620 --> 02:38.480
I'm going to create another input which is going to be an email reader so we're going to put in put

02:38.870 --> 02:43.580
one here and then we're going to have an e-mail or you know do the same thing.

02:43.770 --> 02:46.400
We're going to have a placeholder on here.

02:46.410 --> 02:48.030
Now this is going to be e-mail.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.090
And also it's new A-Class.

02:50.110 --> 02:56.410
So again for the class we're going to say contact two underscores and this is going to be an e-mail.

02:56.640 --> 03:04.110
So this is how we're going to say this now after we're done or here with this contact letter now outside

03:04.110 --> 03:15.000
this contact letter what I would want is to create a common form text area where text area and or here

03:15.000 --> 03:19.820
we're going to say that in this text area we would want a text there.

03:20.130 --> 03:23.070
So I would say over here and this is going to be text element.

03:23.220 --> 03:26.200
Now for a name of getting a mortgage is going to leave it like the way it is.

03:26.370 --> 03:28.700
Heidi we're also not going to touch it.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.820
The columns and rows are going to leave it like the way it is.

03:31.930 --> 03:34.410
Here again we're going to have placeholder here.

03:34.410 --> 03:34.920
We're going to write.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.820
How can I say.

03:37.870 --> 03:41.100
Help help you know this.

03:41.220 --> 03:45.000
And we're also the one to write a class for the class.

03:45.000 --> 03:54.170
We're going to take on that and two underscores and textarea this is going to be our class text area

03:54.410 --> 03:55.150
here.

03:55.310 --> 04:03.960
Now I'm going to say this on here and we have input email or text area and after we are done with textarea

04:04.350 --> 04:07.760
still within the form we will want to place a button.

04:07.890 --> 04:15.030
So I'm going to go after a textarea and I'm going to say that this is going to be a button or here then

04:15.150 --> 04:16.550
type button.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.760
This is going to be a segment and we're going to be submit.

04:20.760 --> 04:27.520
And then in the bottom we're going to say that there is actually going to be a fun awesome moment.

04:27.600 --> 04:34.970
So before that let's create a class let's say for the class this is going to be contact your two underscores

04:35.050 --> 04:45.120
between you know here in button we would want a span with a class of contact all your contact and two

04:45.250 --> 04:52.300
underscores icon or here and within our economy we would want to actually place like home.

04:52.510 --> 05:00.600
So this is going to be I f s f a and we're going to call this a plane or here now outside this band

05:00.630 --> 05:05.750
but still within the button we're going to say send message here.

05:06.080 --> 05:10.420
So we're going to save it and you can see that this is not what I want to do.

05:10.650 --> 05:12.070
I may save it on here.

05:12.150 --> 05:19.110
Now I can see that I have my name put my email textarea and the message now that we're done with the

05:19.110 --> 05:23.130
amount we're ready to go and start dialing this in masseuses.
