00:00.420 --> 00:07.710
Last but not least we have position fixed which in a lot of cases we use for navigation buttons or maybe

00:07.710 --> 00:08.850
for navigation.

00:08.880 --> 00:12.480
Again it's not exclusive but that's probably where we're going to see the most.

00:12.960 --> 00:18.420
And for us we're gonna head over back to indexation email then I'm going to add I don't know some more

00:18.420 --> 00:22.320
paragraph with massive amount of text just because we would need to scroll.

00:22.740 --> 00:29.070
So let's say paragraph and I don't know 500 words is gonna be here massive paragraph and then at the

00:29.070 --> 00:34.050
very bottom just to show you that this is actually working we're gonna create a button now the button

00:34.050 --> 00:40.180
is gonna be very simple again whatever button type is gonna be button or the type.

00:40.230 --> 00:45.930
And here we can just say Now button again this is not gonna be really nav button but it's just gonna

00:45.930 --> 00:47.830
do the job and want to save it.

00:47.830 --> 00:50.370
There's going to be my nav button and this is you know what.

00:50.370 --> 00:52.170
This is not actually big enough.

00:52.370 --> 00:54.920
There's I'm not I cannot do any kind of scrolling here.

00:55.050 --> 00:59.830
So let's do one more thing let's write another paragraph in this case.

00:59.850 --> 01:05.980
Let's try and maybe for 5000 words long low RAM and for some reason I cannot write.

01:06.270 --> 01:12.200
So we're going to test it for five thousand words I'm going to save it now what happens.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.690
Well nothing happens really.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.370
Because again let on.

01:15.380 --> 01:17.160
So now I refreshed and now it's working.

01:17.450 --> 01:19.580
So I have long long long text here.

01:19.760 --> 01:24.500
Hopefully you can see that I'm doing a lot of scrolling and all the way in the bottom.

01:24.500 --> 01:28.440
I have this for now button all the way in the bottom.

01:28.930 --> 01:29.460
OK.

01:29.600 --> 01:33.640
Now what I would like to is to show you how the position fixed is going to work.

01:33.830 --> 01:38.760
So I'm going to head over again and I don't really need this text meaning I can head over back to styles

01:38.780 --> 01:45.980
and only to screw up in the email and I would like to first or change the comment this is gonna be position

01:45.980 --> 01:48.470
fixed and now let's work with our button.

01:48.470 --> 01:56.120
So here let's say all the way on top we're gonna have a button and one do we can we'll have background.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.660
I don't know it's gonna be red.

01:57.710 --> 02:02.760
So sure enough can we read the font is gonna be bigger just so we can see what's happening.

02:02.900 --> 02:10.810
So 40 pixels and maybe let's add the colouring of white not counter reset.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.410
I don't want that color.

02:13.430 --> 02:15.430
Why people.

02:15.440 --> 02:16.250
This is what we want.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.290
So this is what we are now.

02:17.300 --> 02:21.860
But now we can click this obviously all the long and the thing is gonna happen because we haven't hooked

02:21.860 --> 02:28.790
up the javascript but for this we just need position fix and what I would like to do is set it up here

02:29.240 --> 02:30.370
all the way and on top.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.540
And as I'm scrolling it should be saying.

02:32.930 --> 02:39.080
And for this we have position and we have position fixed now the way that position fixed is gonna work

02:39.440 --> 02:46.790
is this is gonna be set relative but in this case this would be set relative to the actual document.

02:46.820 --> 02:49.070
So in the beginning notice it totally disappeared.

02:49.070 --> 02:52.430
So we have position fixed but we cannot find our button.

02:52.430 --> 02:56.450
And as you scrolling down it's not there as you scrolling up.

02:56.510 --> 03:00.080
It's also not there and nor again to see it.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.910
We would need to set it relative.

03:02.090 --> 03:07.820
Now in this case we're saying relative this document and as we're going to be scrolling it's gonna be

03:07.820 --> 03:08.900
sitting here fixed.

03:09.170 --> 03:11.740
That's the reason why it has name position in fact.

03:12.100 --> 03:16.970
So let's say here 0 0 first let's say right.

03:16.970 --> 03:18.100
Is it also gonna be 0.

03:18.140 --> 03:24.130
And what we have now I have my nav button so as I'm scrolling up and down then this is going to be sitting.

03:24.170 --> 03:26.330
And again we can see the map.

03:26.420 --> 03:31.900
Now I'm not going to show you the other properties with values that we had top right left bottom.

03:31.910 --> 03:37.780
I mean you can Explorer on your own but in general terms this is how they position fixed work where

03:37.790 --> 03:43.430
if you set something with position fixed it's going to be relative right now to the document.

03:43.430 --> 03:48.560
So all the document and we're working on but as you're scrolling it's gonna stay in that position.
