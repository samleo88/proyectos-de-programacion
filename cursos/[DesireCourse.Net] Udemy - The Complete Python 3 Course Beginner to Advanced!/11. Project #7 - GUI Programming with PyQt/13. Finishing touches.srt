00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,639
Alright guys, so to finish off this set

2

00:00:02,639  -->  00:00:03,810
of videos what we're going to be doing is

3

00:00:03,810  -->  00:00:05,549
we're going to be finishing up this delete

4

00:00:05,549  -->  00:00:08,700
function here. So, in the last video what

5

00:00:08,700  -->  00:00:10,410
i did was I have replaced one of the

6

00:00:10,410  -->  00:00:14,009
buttons with one that says DEL, and then in the

7

00:00:14,009  -->  00:00:16,320
handle input for that button we check if

8

00:00:16,320  -->  00:00:19,020
it's equal to delete, then we're going to

9

00:00:19,020  -->  00:00:20,910
get the current value, and then we're

10

00:00:20,910  -->  00:00:22,740
going to, we're basically just going to

11

00:00:22,740  -->  00:00:25,560
set the current value equal to the

12

00:00:25,560  -->  00:00:29,670
current value minus the last

13

00:00:29,670  -->  00:00:33,600
character. So, let's go ahead and type

14

00:00:33,600  -->  00:00:38,460
self.results.setText equal to

15

00:00:38,460  -->  00:00:43,410
current value, and then you open it up as

16

00:00:43,410  -->  00:00:51,690
a list, put a colon, and 1, or minus 1, sorry. So I'm going to save

17

00:00:51,690  -->  00:00:56,879
this, and run the app, I'm going to type 55, we're going to

18

00:00:56,879  -->  00:01:00,120
delete, and as you can see it works. So 84

19

00:01:00,120  -->  00:01:05,580
x 99, and we can delete each number,

20

00:01:05,580  -->  00:01:09,900
and then perform operations on that, or

21

00:01:09,900  -->  00:01:12,060
just reset it right there. So that is our

22

00:01:12,060  -->  00:01:15,299
calculator guys, and this is as you can

23

00:01:15,299  -->  00:01:18,090
see a lot of Python here. I'd like to see

24

00:01:18,090  -->  00:01:20,759
your calculator, I will host this

25

00:01:20,759  -->  00:01:23,430
code on github as well so you guys can go

26

00:01:23,430  -->  00:01:26,610
ahead and look at my code. I will add

27

00:01:26,610  -->  00:01:28,560
comments to it before I upload it as well.

28

00:01:28,560  -->  00:01:31,200
So thanks for watching this, in the next

29

00:01:31,200  -->  00:01:32,700
video I think we're going to start

30

00:01:32,700  -->  00:01:35,840
creating a text editor.
