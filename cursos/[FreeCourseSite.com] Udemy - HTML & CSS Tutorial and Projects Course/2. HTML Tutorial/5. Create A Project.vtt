00:00.390 --> 00:02.050
OK enough of me yapping.

00:02.400 --> 00:04.640
Let's start working on our first webpage.

00:04.890 --> 00:09.350
Now in order to do that we are all going to need a project now in order to create a project.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.050
We just need to create a new folder.

00:11.220 --> 00:16.290
And this is obviously a Mac thing where or I'm sorry any operating system thing.

00:16.290 --> 00:19.890
It's nothing to do with Visual Studio code or actual web development.

00:20.160 --> 00:22.220
But we would need to create a new folder.

00:22.230 --> 00:25.550
Now I'm gonna be creating my folder as you can see in a desktop.

00:25.550 --> 00:30.970
And obviously the same thing would work if you need go to your finder and let's say work document.

00:31.080 --> 00:36.750
I just find it much more straightforward if I'm gonna be working with all my files and folders on the

00:36.750 --> 00:37.840
desktop.

00:37.850 --> 00:40.320
And like I said I would like to create a new folder.

00:40.320 --> 00:43.060
And obviously I would need to come up with some kind of name.

00:43.140 --> 00:45.640
So let's say that I'm just gonna call this Agency out.

00:45.900 --> 00:48.190
Now you can call this however you would like.

00:48.210 --> 00:51.030
Bobby went to town or whatever it doesn't really matter.

00:51.330 --> 00:55.700
So let me save this and now I have to look at it how we can get the folder.

00:55.830 --> 00:59.360
So do our work and project to the Visual Studio code.

00:59.580 --> 01:03.230
First of all let me go back to the file and as you can see we have multiple options.

01:03.590 --> 01:08.130
So first of all I can just click over here on open folder and you know what the settings is for now

01:08.130 --> 01:08.970
a little bit annoying.

01:08.970 --> 01:12.360
So let me just close this and here I can click on it.

01:12.490 --> 01:13.910
And this is gonna give me an option.

01:14.220 --> 01:20.160
So if I go to the desktop I can just click on over here and this will open up the folder in the actual

01:20.160 --> 01:21.380
visual studio.

01:21.770 --> 01:27.030
Now we also have an option of as you notice if I'm working with Visual Studio code that I'm gonna have

01:27.030 --> 01:28.120
this file tab.

01:28.370 --> 01:34.490
Now within the file tab notice again we have either open recent or in general would have open.

01:34.520 --> 01:39.840
Now again this would work the same way we click on open and this is going to direct me to the folder

01:39.840 --> 01:43.260
already because they obviously was just here a second ago.

01:43.380 --> 01:48.280
Now last but not least there is a very nifty feature where we can just drag and drop it.

01:48.330 --> 01:54.450
So if I'm gonna grab this project that I have right now or folder or directory call this whatever you

01:54.540 --> 02:00.360
like and just drag and drop it here and this is gonna do the same thing where as you can see right now

02:01.020 --> 02:07.050
I have my folder available to me and I can start creating files and other folders maybe within this

02:07.050 --> 02:11.250
project folder and basically get up and running with my project.
