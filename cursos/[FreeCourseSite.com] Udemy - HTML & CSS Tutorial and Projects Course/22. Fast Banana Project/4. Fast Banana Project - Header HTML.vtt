WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:03.550
Mounded we're done with a general set up.

00:03.600 --> 00:09.900
Let's actually go and see a specific set up that we have for our first on a project.

00:09.960 --> 00:14.760
So here you can see that this is going to be our finished project or here that I'm going to keep it

00:15.240 --> 00:21.780
in the browser or you know like this right now or here you can see that I have a desktop obviously.

00:21.930 --> 00:23.770
And here this is going to be my fault.

00:23.980 --> 00:24.270
Right.

00:24.300 --> 00:29.520
And in the folder I have a phantasm and on here I'm going to have a bunch of images that are going to

00:29.520 --> 00:35.480
be using then this is going to be the next H M L and C Ss and all her script.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.060
Right.

00:36.240 --> 00:43.400
So now that we have our folders set up let's go actually to our text to her or here like this.

00:43.470 --> 00:44.960
And you can see that over here right.

00:44.970 --> 00:48.970
I have a main style sheet and this is going to be my main.

00:49.020 --> 00:54.800
SS Then I have a link to font or some to this folder over here.

00:55.060 --> 00:58.520
Then over here this is going to be the Google fonts.

00:58.650 --> 01:04.680
Right so I'm getting my Google answer here and what I would need to do is actually check what I have

01:04.710 --> 01:05.460
in mind here.

01:05.480 --> 01:06.440
Yes right.

01:06.480 --> 01:15.420
So my main success or here I have the colors I'm so I have the yellow gray black blue cream and white

01:15.900 --> 01:17.800
and I was going to be working with all of them.

01:17.800 --> 01:23.320
So this is not really important to actually write them down right now.

01:23.430 --> 01:23.640
Right.

01:23.640 --> 01:28.890
Because once you're going to be styling the element we're actually going to be applying these colors

01:29.640 --> 01:32.110
and warriors crabgrass is going to be empty.

01:32.110 --> 01:36.630
And to tell you the truth there's not going to be much info anyway right.

01:36.630 --> 01:40.660
Because for the Jake werie plugins they're all going to be using right.

01:40.890 --> 01:43.250
Let's say for example this plug in right.

01:43.260 --> 01:49.470
We're going to create our own separate script js files meaning the javascript files that are going to

01:49.470 --> 01:50.380
be separate.

01:50.450 --> 01:54.700
Right so here let's say this is going to be our Jake Querrey plug in.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.500
Right so this is going to be the ISO job.

01:56.670 --> 01:58.350
And over here you can see what happens right.

01:58.350 --> 02:02.040
So basically this is going to be filtering over here images for us.

02:02.040 --> 02:02.550
Right.

02:02.620 --> 02:10.830
And again that will going to be creating a new separate javascript file just so we don't actually stuff

02:10.890 --> 02:11.980
everything together.

02:12.180 --> 02:15.190
And this is going to be much more understanding that way.

02:15.210 --> 02:15.540
Right.

02:15.720 --> 02:22.380
So what I'm going to do here is going to close the script jast we don't need the scramjets and we don't

02:22.380 --> 02:28.740
need for now the Says either or here Arnold's going to say that yes we would want to save what we were

02:28.740 --> 02:31.490
doing and over here in the exchange.

02:31.530 --> 02:33.360
Now we're going to start building.

02:33.390 --> 02:38.240
And the first thing that would want to build is out here would want to start building the nav bar.

02:38.480 --> 02:38.730
All right.

02:38.730 --> 02:43.920
So we would need all here now imagine we're going to need all headers button right and then we're going

02:43.920 --> 02:49.350
to need links and like a like we have done with the previous projects right.

02:49.350 --> 02:51.620
We are starting mobile first.

02:51.840 --> 02:56.790
So basically we're going to be starting to design for the mobile screen first and then we're going to

02:56.790 --> 03:01.780
do all kinds of set ups right and media queries right for the bigger screens.

03:01.800 --> 03:02.270
Right.

03:02.330 --> 03:05.340
So here this is going to be perfect for us right.

03:05.370 --> 03:06.860
Or here this life.

03:07.160 --> 03:11.940
And the first thing that I'm going to do in the body I'm going to create a header right and I'm going

03:11.940 --> 03:16.210
to create or hear a common that I'm creating better here.

03:16.290 --> 03:21.520
And I was going to copy this and I'm going to say and of better than on here.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.820
This is going to be a header element right.

03:23.820 --> 03:26.500
And I'm still going to be using meth right now right.

03:26.550 --> 03:32.450
And for those of you who don't know what is meant right this is really speeding up our workflow.

03:32.460 --> 03:32.740
Right.

03:32.730 --> 03:37.800
So only thing we need to type over here is the domain name and press tab and you can see that it creates

03:37.800 --> 03:41.600
or hear the closing and the opening tag for us.

03:41.790 --> 03:45.280
And after that in the header we're actually going to place now.

03:45.390 --> 03:49.570
And we're going to place now with an I.D. or year of NAV press.

03:49.610 --> 03:54.720
We're hearing this is going to be Nav. with an idea of you know we're here the first thing that we want

03:54.720 --> 03:56.550
to do is actually place a logo.

03:56.910 --> 04:00.640
So here I'm going to say like this that this is going to be actually a div.

04:00.870 --> 04:01.240
Right.

04:01.330 --> 04:08.380
And we can say like this class I have a logo or here press type or here now we have the door.

04:08.730 --> 04:11.000
Then within a day we're going to have an image.

04:11.000 --> 04:11.450
All right.

04:11.580 --> 04:15.690
So I'm just going to write an image and we're here with the source of we're going to go with images

04:16.140 --> 04:18.410
and then we will need a nav logo.

04:18.610 --> 04:19.150
Right.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.490
So I'm going to go with this banana right.

04:21.510 --> 04:23.380
This is where we're going to have here.

04:23.580 --> 04:27.500
And then after that we would want let's say alternative we're going to say this is going to be Nav.

04:28.010 --> 04:29.910
logo on here like this.

04:29.910 --> 04:34.560
And then after that we would want to have a phantasm like on right next to it.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.210
So I'm going to say we're here.

04:36.630 --> 04:42.480
This is going to be class here or here we're going to say far far down.

04:42.550 --> 04:45.390
So this is going to be erro down.

04:45.620 --> 04:46.250
Maicon.

04:46.290 --> 04:48.860
Now I can see that I'm not using them right now right.

04:48.870 --> 04:54.120
And you can see how much longer it takes to actually write something right there therefore actually

04:54.120 --> 04:54.980
using it.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.230
Does doesn't really speed up your work.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.240
But for these fun times I'm just going to say.

05:00.690 --> 05:06.140
This is going to be toggle here between this press table here.

05:06.180 --> 05:09.020
Now maybe let's do a closing diagram.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.940
You can see what happens right.

05:11.070 --> 05:12.160
We have an image.

05:12.390 --> 05:14.540
And then over here this is going to be are fun to us.

05:14.760 --> 05:18.560
And of course again we haven't applied any flex box nothing like that right.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.300
That's why it looks like that.

05:20.340 --> 05:26.700
And then after that one we would want is actually once the day is finished here we would want a on order

05:26.770 --> 05:28.460
list like this.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.550
I'm going to give it right away.

05:29.550 --> 05:34.290
Class and class is going to have legs or here presto.

05:34.450 --> 05:35.950
Now we have on our list.

05:36.030 --> 05:44.230
Then after that we want a list item more here within the list item we're going to have a Tref a link.

05:44.370 --> 05:47.400
And then after that we will want to say that we want.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.710
I don't know what say.

05:48.720 --> 05:54.090
Let's start with five of them right here where I'm going to say that I would want like this five of

05:54.090 --> 06:01.140
them so I'm going to say we're going this and I'm going to put put parentheses on multiplied by five.

06:01.150 --> 06:04.470
Press tab and I can see that I have five links right.

06:04.500 --> 06:11.620
And all of them have or here a Atra right and the edge is going to have it as a hash tag.

06:11.810 --> 06:17.490
And so this is going to be the debt ceiling Norio we're going to write home then we're going to write

06:17.580 --> 06:25.180
services next year we're going to say this is going to be port folio here.

06:25.380 --> 06:28.070
Then after that we're going to have a about.

06:28.450 --> 06:31.730
And last one is going to be contact contact.

06:31.730 --> 06:32.660
All right.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.800
So we have five links here.

06:34.950 --> 06:36.450
And after that we would want.

06:36.610 --> 06:36.900
Right.

06:36.910 --> 06:39.750
Or here you can see that on a smaller screen.

06:40.010 --> 06:40.250
Right.

06:40.290 --> 06:43.250
I'm actually going to have these fantastic in my All right.

06:43.290 --> 06:44.920
So you would need to create.

06:45.180 --> 06:46.690
So we're going to go back over here.

06:46.770 --> 06:47.050
Right.

06:47.070 --> 06:49.900
Still within this unheard list.

06:50.040 --> 06:50.320
Right.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.820
And this is going to be a list item.

06:51.990 --> 06:52.250
Right.

06:52.340 --> 06:58.140
And we're going to say this is going to be class and we're going to give it now have icons like this

06:58.720 --> 07:06.540
then or here in this time we're all going to say is that we would want Felix and someone to say we're

07:06.540 --> 07:08.950
here a miss.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.080
And then within.

07:10.080 --> 07:14.280
And they were going to say this is going to be I and that's right.

07:14.440 --> 07:17.340
And I can see that I have a link right.

07:17.410 --> 07:22.030
Again I'm going to have them using an order here and this is going to be a fun awesome read.

07:22.050 --> 07:27.590
You can see that I didn't finish it and I didn't write the full frontal assault like that out here.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.320
We would want a one two three four.

07:30.530 --> 07:30.740
Right.

07:30.750 --> 07:37.160
So I can just select this line and if I press control L right now it's going to copy this one.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.400
Let's say three times.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.120
Right.

07:39.130 --> 07:48.030
When are you going to start with a Facebook so far book than the next one is going to be a Instagram.

07:48.030 --> 07:57.880
So this is going to be for Instagram we're here then after that we would want a Twitter.

07:57.890 --> 08:04.710
So I would say for Twitter and then after the last one is going to be linked in once or linking then

08:04.710 --> 08:11.000
or however you want to pronounce it this is going to be a link then link it right.

08:11.330 --> 08:12.910
Now we have four icons.

08:12.910 --> 08:13.780
All right.

08:14.130 --> 08:16.750
And now you would actually want to text.

08:16.770 --> 08:17.070
All right.

08:17.070 --> 08:18.880
We would want this first banana.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.290
And this is what we do.

08:20.290 --> 08:21.820
And these two buttons.

08:21.960 --> 08:22.530
Right.

08:22.530 --> 08:25.140
And again what is going to be creating HDMI out for an hour right.

08:25.140 --> 08:30.810
We're just going to deal with CSSA first with over here with this.

08:30.880 --> 08:31.420
Right.

08:31.470 --> 08:37.380
It's just it's good if we have some kind of content the next year you can see that if we are doing some

08:37.380 --> 08:44.160
kind of changes or here whether it's actually work here once we have the nav after that we would want

08:44.160 --> 08:45.210
a banner.

08:45.210 --> 08:52.380
Someone said this is going to be ready or here with a banner so I'm going to see a D banner press time

08:52.400 --> 08:53.200
or here.

08:53.370 --> 08:58.890
And after that we were going to have a div with the class and the class over here is going to be banner

08:59.880 --> 09:01.620
text here.

09:01.770 --> 09:05.800
And within this banner text class we're going to have a few things right.

09:05.820 --> 09:07.800
First we're going to have a Hening one.

09:07.980 --> 09:11.670
And our hero is going to say that he's going to say fast.

09:12.210 --> 09:13.710
It's going right fast.

09:13.710 --> 09:18.660
And Ana you know Agnes press tab now I have my hand in one.

09:18.900 --> 09:24.630
After that I was going to have a heading three here like this and this is going to say this is what

09:24.630 --> 09:25.750
we do.

09:25.760 --> 09:31.060
I said this is what we do here again and press time.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.780
Now we have a heading three.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.680
And then it will need two things.

09:34.750 --> 09:40.560
So I'm going to say over here this is going to be our first link hashtag here and we're going to say

09:40.560 --> 09:43.940
on here start here now.

09:44.220 --> 09:49.470
This is going to be our text and we can just write all in lowercase just so later on you can see that

09:49.470 --> 09:53.890
are actually properties and values are actually changing once we apply them.

09:54.160 --> 09:59.240
So I'm going to start right now and again I'm just going to select a line and I'm going to copy this.

09:59.330 --> 10:07.110
And here we're going to say learn more and so can just in this text you know let's learn more now that

10:07.110 --> 10:08.110
we're done.

10:08.230 --> 10:12.180
We had reached him now for our.

10:12.250 --> 10:19.290
All right we're ready to move on to see a sense and actually start styling on here now.
