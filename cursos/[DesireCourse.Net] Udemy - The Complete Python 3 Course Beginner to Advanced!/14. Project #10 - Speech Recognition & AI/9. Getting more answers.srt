1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,310
Alright guys, so it wasn't actually a

2

00:00:02,310  -->  00:00:04,110
problem with my internet connection or

3

00:00:04,110  -->  00:00:07,109
anything, it's a problem with our program

4

00:00:07,109  -->  00:00:08,940
and it's not really a problem so much as

5

00:00:08,940  -->  00:00:11,849
ways that we can improve it. There are

6

00:00:11,849  -->  00:00:14,969
certain websites that, or there are

7

00:00:14,969  -->  00:00:19,920
certain Google searches that will return

8

00:00:19,920  -->  00:00:22,439
the exact element we're looking for,

9

00:00:22,439  -->  00:00:27,570
however this kind of thing this uses the

10

00:00:27,570  -->  00:00:30,929
class underscore XWk. So what we can do

11

00:00:30,929  -->  00:00:32,189
is we can copy this and add a

12

00:00:32,189  -->  00:00:36,930
conditional in there, the get_answer. What

13

00:00:36,930  -->  00:00:47,850
we're going to do...

14

00:00:47,850  -->  00:00:50,760
Alright, we need to change that because

15

00:00:50,760  -->  00:00:53,520
we're first going to look for this. If

16

00:00:53,520  -->  00:00:58,649
not answer we're going to then look for

17

00:00:58,649  -->  00:01:04,170
this, answer equals soup.find_all class

18

00:01:04,170  -->  00:01:11,700
equals that one. So let's go ahead and

19

00:01:11,700  -->  00:01:17,000
save, and let's ask who plays Kelso.

20

00:01:21,280  -->  00:01:24,390
"How to make applesauce?"

21

00:01:34,440  -->  00:01:37,470
"To make basic applesauce, peel, core

22

00:01:37,470  -->  00:01:39,540
and coarsely chop 2 pounds..." Okay, it's working

23

00:01:39,540  -->  00:01:46,130
so far. "Who plays Kelso?"

24

00:01:56,040  -->  00:01:58,440
That one failed. We will have to look at

25

00:01:58,440  -->  00:02:01,080
that more. And how to determine actually

26

00:02:01,080  -->  00:02:04,170
what class that is I'm actually just

27

00:02:04,170  -->  00:02:07,020
going to dump the entire file here, so

28

00:02:07,020  -->  00:02:10,979
with open test, sorry gotta put that in a

29

00:02:10,979  -->  00:02:20,070
string, "test.html", "w+" as f:, we're going to

30

00:02:20,070  -->  00:02:24,420
say f.write, and we're going to write our

31

00:02:24,420  -->  00:02:29,130
soup, and then f.close, so that we can see,

32

00:02:29,130  -->  00:02:32,160
actually. Let's run that same question

33

00:02:32,160  -->  00:02:34,260
again, then look at the page that we get

34

00:02:34,260  -->  00:02:36,420
back, and determine what class we should

35

00:02:36,420  -->  00:02:43,310
be using. "Who played Kelso?"

36

00:02:52,760  -->  00:02:54,860
That looks tremendously wrong but we got

37

00:02:54,860  -->  00:02:57,620
our file here, and it didn't write

38

00:02:57,620  -->  00:03:01,400
anything. Alright, so, let's actually

39

00:03:01,400  -->  00:03:03,799
look at why it didn't write anything, and

40

00:03:03,799  -->  00:03:05,720
let's find out how we can make it right

41

00:03:05,720  -->  00:03:13,790
stuff. So, let's convert this to a string,

42

00:03:13,790  -->  00:03:21,079
sorry about that. Alright, let's try again and

43

00:03:21,079  -->  00:03:25,459
this time let's say, "who won the Super

44

00:03:25,459  -->  00:03:34,430
Bowl?" We're looking for that. "Who won the

45

00:03:34,430  -->  00:03:42,730
Super Bowl?" And now we wait.

46

00:03:47,210  -->  00:03:52,820
Alright, so we have a page here and this

47

00:03:52,820  -->  00:03:54,980
is what we want at the beginning of line

48

00:03:54,980  -->  00:03:57,350
three, so what we're going to do is at end of

49

00:03:57,350  -->  00:03:59,870
line teo we're going to go right to the

50

00:03:59,870  -->  00:04:04,900
end, and we're going to look at...

51

00:04:13,620  -->  00:04:25,919
this line...sorry about

52

00:04:25,919  -->  00:04:27,630
that. I will edit that out, actually.

53

00:04:27,630  -->  00:04:30,750
Alright, so, this line wrap is what's

54

00:04:30,750  -->  00:04:33,300
causing a problem at this point. What we

55

00:04:33,300  -->  00:04:38,220
need to do is find where the top of the

56

00:04:38,220  -->  00:04:45,180
page starts and actually has content...

57

00:04:45,180  -->  00:04:48,419
we need to find the

58

00:04:48,419  -->  00:04:52,289
beginning of the results here, and then

59

00:04:52,289  -->  00:05:03,020
is that it? No, past 24 hours.

60

00:05:12,009  -->  00:05:15,189
So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to

61

00:05:15,189  -->  00:05:20,050
search this right here, that should be

62

00:05:20,050  -->  00:05:21,939
able to find the string that we're

63

00:05:21,939  -->  00:05:26,649
looking for, there we go. So this is m3b,

64

00:05:26,649  -->  00:05:30,219
that's the class we need to look up. So

65

00:05:30,219  -->  00:05:33,999
let's copy it, and this should be a lot

66

00:05:33,999  -->  00:05:37,779
easier actually. So, let's drop in here

67

00:05:37,779  -->  00:05:41,710
and put that there. Now let's run it and

68

00:05:41,710  -->  00:05:44,229
ask the question again, and Google's only

69

00:05:44,229  -->  00:05:45,279
going to give like four or five

70

00:05:45,279  -->  00:05:48,039
different types of responses so that's

71

00:05:48,039  -->  00:05:50,020
when this is going to be useful. We can

72

00:05:50,020  -->  00:05:51,759
determine what kind of questions are

73

00:05:51,759  -->  00:05:54,639
most commonly asked and then code it to

74

00:05:54,639  -->  00:05:56,620
find whichever one. And, again, this isn't

75

00:05:56,620  -->  00:05:58,779
true artificial intelligence, this is

76

00:05:58,779  -->  00:06:02,199
just kind of a connection of

77

00:06:02,199  -->  00:06:04,930
artificial intelligence. We're using a

78

00:06:04,930  -->  00:06:09,639
source of data that we, you know I mean

79

00:06:09,639  -->  00:06:11,889
we could actually create a database and

80

00:06:11,889  -->  00:06:14,379
we could tell it to go learn about

81

00:06:14,379  -->  00:06:16,389
certain things. So we could create an

82

00:06:16,389  -->  00:06:20,379
empty database and then you know when we

83

00:06:20,379  -->  00:06:22,270
input the command go learn about

84

00:06:22,270  -->  00:06:27,610
football, we could we could send our

85

00:06:27,610  -->  00:06:32,169
program to the most relevant Wikipedia

86

00:06:32,169  -->  00:06:34,539
page and have it index all of that data,

87

00:06:34,539  -->  00:06:39,099
and make sense of it by compiling facts,

88

00:06:39,099  -->  00:06:41,499
and then we would be able to ask it

89

00:06:41,499  -->  00:06:43,629
questions about it, and what it would do

90

00:06:43,629  -->  00:06:45,309
we would have to create some sort of search

91

00:06:45,309  -->  00:06:47,259
interface just like creating a search

92

00:06:47,259  -->  00:06:49,029
page on the internet like Google is done,

93

00:06:49,029  -->  00:06:50,860
and we would be able to search our own

94

00:06:50,860  -->  00:06:52,959
database, but again that is a big, big job.

95

00:06:52,959  -->  00:06:55,990
So we're not doing the memorization of

96

00:06:55,990  -->  00:06:57,669
facts we're just doing how to retrieve

97

00:06:57,669  -->  00:07:01,629
them, I guess. So, let's go ahead and ask

98

00:07:01,629  -->  00:07:08,669
it this question. "Who won the Super Bowl?"

99

00:07:16,510  -->  00:07:22,540
And we wait...New England Patriots. "Who is

100

00:07:22,540  -->  00:07:25,260
Kurt Russell?"

101

00:07:35,500  -->  00:07:38,350
Kurt Vogel Russell born March 17,

102

00:07:38,350  -->  00:07:41,350
1951, and there we go. Let me

103

00:07:41,350  -->  00:07:43,840
just stop this. So as

104

00:07:43,840  -->  00:07:46,810
you can see we can ask our program very

105

00:07:46,810  -->  00:07:49,750
simple questions, very direct questions,

106

00:07:49,750  -->  00:07:54,730
and we'll be able to get a response if

107

00:07:54,730  -->  00:08:02,950
Google has this. Otherwise, if at this

108

00:08:02,950  -->  00:08:06,430
point it doesn't have an answer we're

109

00:08:06,430  -->  00:08:12,550
going to set the answer to "I don't know."

110

00:08:12,550  -->  00:08:21,580
There we go. So, we are good to go, I

111

00:08:21,580  -->  00:08:23,500
just want to search right quick to see

112

00:08:23,500  -->  00:08:29,500
another few examples. So, let's say when

113

00:08:29,500  -->  00:08:32,979
was pizza invented? And as you can see

114

00:08:32,979  -->  00:08:34,930
we've got a nice little blurb about that.

115

00:08:34,930  -->  00:08:36,969
We could ask that question to our

116

00:08:36,969  -->  00:08:44,080
program. We could say, who invented Python?

117

00:08:44,080  -->  00:08:48,640
And we would get this guy's name right

118

00:08:48,640  -->  00:08:52,570
here Guido van Rossum, and this is just

119

00:08:52,570  -->  00:08:55,930
an example of what you can do you know

120

00:08:55,930  -->  00:08:57,460
with Python and connecting

121

00:08:57,460  -->  00:08:59,680
different dots. This again is not true

122

00:08:59,680  -->  00:09:01,450
artificial intelligence but for the sake

123

00:09:01,450  -->  00:09:05,290
of this series this can be enhanced, and

124

00:09:05,290  -->  00:09:08,890
superseded, and can be expanded so far

125

00:09:08,890  -->  00:09:10,960
that it can be artificial intelligence,

126

00:09:10,960  -->  00:09:13,510
and you guys are prepared right now to

127

00:09:13,510  -->  00:09:16,390
do that if you would want to. It's just a

128

00:09:16,390  -->  00:09:20,130
very, very big task.
