Once we have covered fluxbox and Tauriel now would be a good time to put flex books to use and what

00:07.620 --> 00:12.960
we're going to do here we're going to build our portfolio project as you can see here we're going to

00:12.960 --> 00:16.930
start with a bar or here this is going to be the logo.

00:17.010 --> 00:19.180
And these are actually going to be links.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.340
However if we're all going to make more here our screens are smaller.

00:24.510 --> 00:29.460
You can see they're all going to have a button and with the help of a button we're going to be able

00:29.460 --> 00:37.800
to actually display the links in column layout and once we have done with a number then or here this

00:37.800 --> 00:42.050
is going to be our header section we're all going to have a title now.

00:42.060 --> 00:44.610
Next section is going to be in about section.

00:44.790 --> 00:47.320
So here we're going to have a picture over here.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.880
These are going to be two links.

00:49.140 --> 00:51.810
Then these are going to be services section.

00:51.830 --> 00:58.500
So we're going to use a fantastic more here and we're going to just create six and once we're done with

00:58.590 --> 01:05.690
a services section then the next one is going to be a number section and after numbers section.

01:05.730 --> 01:07.870
We're actually going to have a project section.

01:08.100 --> 01:13.140
So we're in the project section and we're going to have pictures and as we're hovering over here you

01:13.140 --> 01:16.630
can see that our link icon is going to be displayed.

01:16.890 --> 01:20.990
And once we're done with a project section this is going to be the contact section.

01:21.090 --> 01:27.300
We're going to place three forms or here on the bottom in the bottom and the last one is going to be

01:27.300 --> 01:27.840
for real.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.210
This is going to place a social icons.

01:30.270 --> 01:34.380
So let's start working and let's start building with a flex box.
