Okeydokey we have one decent sized image and one very big oversized image.

00:08.140 --> 00:13.880
So how we can render them exactly the same size or at least the second one.

00:13.990 --> 00:15.420
Smaller than it is right now.

00:16.490 --> 00:22.190
Now before we do anything I will right away I want to tell you that while this may be the fastest way

00:22.790 --> 00:28.610
however you need to understand it later on you're going to learn better ways that some of them are going

00:28.610 --> 00:34.430
to involve success and some of them are just going to involve cropping the image before we even render

00:34.430 --> 00:39.190
it but I'm going to get into this in the next video in this video.

00:39.290 --> 00:45.070
I would just like to show you how we can use attributes the email attributes in order to do that.

00:45.810 --> 00:47.480
So first of all let's test that out.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.830
How big is the image.

00:49.340 --> 00:55.280
So let's say for the Udemy one once we Click on image notice the image is going to be rendered and there's

00:55.280 --> 00:56.500
many ways how we can check it.

00:56.510 --> 01:02.800
But first this one probably here you notice this is gonna be two hundred fifty nine by one hundred and

01:02.800 --> 01:03.980
ninety four.

01:04.010 --> 01:07.680
So those would be the pixels then for the left of our skin.

01:07.720 --> 01:09.040
This is going to be bigger.

01:09.140 --> 01:13.540
We have thousand by six hundred and sixty.

01:14.210 --> 01:18.300
So we already know that we would be looking for something like this where we have to have hundred fifty

01:18.310 --> 01:19.760
nine by one ninety four.

01:20.660 --> 01:28.130
Now whenever we're working with an image not all so we are getting the source attribute and nailed.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.620
We also have an option of height and the way.

01:31.180 --> 01:37.010
And again this is gonna be very straightforward so as I start typing notice again we're getting a suggestion

01:37.380 --> 01:39.700
that we're going to be looking for the height attribute.

01:39.770 --> 01:45.680
Now also like I said we have with now if we're gonna type with a automatically is going to adjust the

01:45.680 --> 01:46.520
height.

01:46.580 --> 01:49.100
So with this probably even going to be the fastest one.

01:49.640 --> 01:55.770
So if I'm gonna say let's say two hundred and sixty because I believe that the first one was two hundred

01:55.770 --> 02:01.040
fifty nine and you know what I maybe wouldn't want to do this with the demi logo because this is already

02:01.040 --> 02:02.290
rendered correctly.

02:02.510 --> 02:03.380
So my apologies.

02:03.380 --> 02:10.650
Let's get rid of the with the demi logo and let's navigate through the left up logo or laptop image.

02:10.760 --> 02:15.450
Let's be more precise and let's add here that we would want with off 260.

02:15.940 --> 02:17.810
Well let's notice what happened.

02:17.870 --> 02:22.080
Sure enough I'm getting my with an eye right away like I said the height was adjusted.

02:22.340 --> 02:25.870
Now if you still like to readjust the height specifically.

02:25.870 --> 02:29.670
So let's say the height in my case would be something like a hundred notice.

02:29.690 --> 02:34.430
Now I'm just going to make sure that the height this hundred but again if we're going to get rid of

02:34.430 --> 02:41.870
this then obviously we're all just going to have the width and height is gonna be adjusted automatically.

02:41.870 --> 02:49.400
And this is how we can basically the fastest way we can readjust the height and the width on the image

02:49.730 --> 02:50.720
in page email.
