WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:04.340
And the next section are going to be working on or here is going to be the skills section.

00:04.340 --> 00:05.410
All right I like this.

00:05.430 --> 00:06.500
So what are you going to do here.

00:06.570 --> 00:08.470
We're going to go back to the next issue the amount.

00:08.790 --> 00:15.110
And we're going to say this is going to be skills covering the whole line up in price here.

00:15.190 --> 00:20.130
You can put a line in place and we're going to say end of skills.

00:20.270 --> 00:20.560
Right.

00:20.570 --> 00:21.220
Or here.

00:21.460 --> 00:25.290
Then once we have this now I would want to add some major damage.

00:25.560 --> 00:31.310
So we're going to start over here by saying that this is going to be a skills correction.

00:31.430 --> 00:31.920
Right.

00:32.130 --> 00:39.300
So this is going to be section class skills and hashtags skills are like this.

00:39.340 --> 00:46.350
Once we have the section we would want a deal with the skills and we're going to say center center or

00:46.410 --> 00:50.580
here once we have this div now I would want a article.

00:50.640 --> 00:55.360
So I want to see article and this is going to have a class of skill.

00:55.370 --> 00:55.620
All right.

00:55.620 --> 01:01.020
So on here the article is going to have a class of skill and they're all going to have six of them right

01:01.460 --> 01:01.660
here.

01:01.710 --> 01:04.940
The first thing that we're going to do is we're going to have a fundraiser Maicon.

01:05.170 --> 01:11.970
So I'm going to say we're here and this is going to be a link here with a hash tag on here and we're

01:11.970 --> 01:19.420
going to say that inside this one we're going to have a high element with a B class and if a.

01:19.500 --> 01:23.630
And this is going to be five or failing this.

01:23.690 --> 01:28.290
Once we have this all here now I can see that we have the icon now once we have placed go.

01:28.320 --> 01:33.050
Now what we would want is having one here and we're going to write.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.490
This is going to be HD.

01:34.510 --> 01:43.300
Now then once we have the HD Well now I would want a paragraph with 10 letters right with 10 words.

01:43.320 --> 01:49.110
So here we're going to say I'm going to sit down on this time once.

01:49.350 --> 01:52.520
First time second time now we have a paragraph.

01:52.650 --> 01:58.670
Now what we would want to do is obviously copy and paste this five times you know to get six of them

01:58.830 --> 02:01.030
one two three four five.

02:01.180 --> 02:02.060
All right.

02:02.130 --> 02:03.880
See we have six of them.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.890
And then we just need to change the values.

02:05.970 --> 02:08.270
So the first one was the five.

02:08.430 --> 02:14.640
Then this guy was CSSA 3 and over here this one was C Ss.

02:14.640 --> 02:19.890
Then after that next one was a javascript right here.

02:19.890 --> 02:23.270
So the next article over here was a J.

02:23.350 --> 02:33.290
S here and over here with the heading one we also wrote G-S then out and then we had a node J.S. node.

02:33.510 --> 02:35.670
And and here we just right.

02:35.670 --> 02:39.250
This is going to be nold like this.

02:39.390 --> 02:46.110
And then after that we have an angle and then we have a react and so angular sort of this is going to

02:46.110 --> 02:47.400
be nolde.

02:47.530 --> 02:55.670
Then the last one let's say or here and this is going to be react to right to react and then what he

02:55.680 --> 03:01.460
would want to do here is going to change the angular and let's say Oh these guys are going to be Angleterre

03:03.180 --> 03:09.290
right now consider we have six thousand My kids are here right now what you need to do is actually go

03:09.290 --> 03:10.430
out and style.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.890
So we're going to have it over here.

03:13.020 --> 03:17.370
We're going to go back to Mansi assess and then we'll have a skills.

03:17.370 --> 03:17.690
All right.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.260
And what we would want to do.

03:19.260 --> 03:19.810
All right.

03:19.980 --> 03:23.850
So first of all we're going to have the same thing that we had with this background.

03:23.850 --> 03:24.480
Right.

03:24.510 --> 03:32.390
So I'm going to say that this is going to be a background you know here and then we'll have image and

03:32.400 --> 03:34.440
we're going to have a skills background.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.360
So let's find out where is our skills skills background.

03:38.360 --> 03:38.860
All right.

03:38.940 --> 03:43.610
So this is going to be our background then we'll right away are going to have the same things we had

03:43.650 --> 03:44.350
before.

03:44.370 --> 03:46.650
Center cover.

03:46.660 --> 03:47.310
All right.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.240
Fixed.

03:48.530 --> 03:52.410
And we're going to say no repeat no repeat here.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.130
All right.

03:53.200 --> 03:59.180
So these shouldn't be the things for the image right side right away a linear gradient also.

03:59.260 --> 03:59.580
Right.

03:59.610 --> 04:02.500
And if we really want we can actually copy and paste this.

04:02.530 --> 04:08.390
We can go ahead and we can just get this linear grade in because it's going to be exactly the same.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.620
Maybe we can make it darker.

04:10.620 --> 04:12.560
All right so this would be the only difference.

04:12.670 --> 04:17.880
So I'm going to go over here and press this thing and see that I have my linear gradient.

04:17.880 --> 04:18.280
Right.

04:18.420 --> 04:19.870
But let's make it darker.

04:19.870 --> 04:25.620
So I'm going to say six more here and I'm going to say six or here so I can see that it's a very dark

04:25.620 --> 04:31.830
image than what I would want to do is start working with a skill center which is the div that actually

04:31.830 --> 04:38.340
holds everything and holds all six articles so I'm going to say skills center.

04:38.490 --> 04:45.120
Well we're here with we're going to set it to 90 percent here this margin.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.520
0 auto right.

04:46.740 --> 04:48.180
So something like this.

04:48.330 --> 04:54.510
Then we're going to find is where is skill skill and are here for each skill.

04:54.510 --> 04:59.910
What we should do first of all going to say text the line center here like this.

04:59.910 --> 05:08.340
Then we'll have a margin 30 pixels right in between but zero left and right and after that it will be

05:08.360 --> 05:09.660
not a color.

05:10.010 --> 05:15.460
So I'm going to say over here that the color is going to be hash tag five of three or five.

05:15.640 --> 05:16.090
Really.

05:16.140 --> 05:16.870
That's right.

05:16.910 --> 05:18.730
So this is going to be for the legs.

05:18.850 --> 05:26.930
Now once I'm dealt with this skill now I would want to work with a skills here legs so I'm going to

05:26.930 --> 05:35.610
say skill a more here and I'm going to say this is going to be fun size 80 pixels or here like this.

05:35.630 --> 05:38.610
All right so the icons are 80 pixels.

05:38.690 --> 05:48.450
And we're going to have this color stack at 8 1/2 C and then we'll have B F D B D like this.

05:48.500 --> 05:52.100
Once we have this now we're going to want to work with a heading 1.

05:52.340 --> 06:01.640
So I'm going to say scale and in one order and this is going to be font size 30 pixels like this text

06:01.850 --> 06:06.890
transform to say uppercase X transform uppercase.

06:06.930 --> 06:14.780
So this is going to be all capital letters margin zero top zero all right 10 pixels bottom zero left

06:15.360 --> 06:18.750
and it's only we want to push a little bit down here right.

06:18.790 --> 06:25.630
And then we'll have a fun style it out front style it taluk here like this.

06:25.940 --> 06:29.450
And then let's do a paragraph or.

06:29.460 --> 06:30.030
All right.

06:30.290 --> 06:37.180
So it's over here and this is going to be skill like this paragraph right.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.650
And what should happen right.

06:38.730 --> 06:45.270
First of all we're going to have a line height of two in this letter spacing of five letter spacing

06:45.270 --> 06:47.180
five pixels.

06:47.190 --> 06:51.430
All right so let's go back over here and let's say five pixels.

06:51.710 --> 06:52.150
Right.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.950
That would be the letter space.

06:54.130 --> 06:59.650
And now would we would want to do is actually work with creating these lines right.

06:59.850 --> 07:05.000
So you can see or hear that if we have the bigger screen right we have these border lines right.

07:05.060 --> 07:10.470
However if we go to the smaller screen and nothing happens right but here we got the bigger one right

07:10.500 --> 07:12.520
we have these waterlines already.

07:12.540 --> 07:13.620
So how do we do this.

07:13.620 --> 07:14.050
All right.

07:14.190 --> 07:16.490
So first we're going to say a media screen.

07:16.560 --> 07:20.720
All right so well first of all going to create some rules as the screen changes.

07:21.000 --> 07:28.200
So you know we're going to say men with and we're going to say nine nine to nine and two pixels or here

07:28.520 --> 07:30.780
are you know what let's start with 776.

07:30.800 --> 07:35.070
I really went ahead a little but 7 7 6 pixels.

07:35.070 --> 07:40.520
And once we have this again we're going to work with this skill center because this is the parent element

07:40.580 --> 07:40.800
right.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.410
That's one of the reasons why recreating this one right.

07:43.590 --> 07:49.460
So I'm going to say skills center or here and we're going to save this playful X right.

07:49.740 --> 07:55.700
Then we're going to say flex and we're going to save wrap here and we're going to say we're all here

07:55.800 --> 07:56.790
right.

07:57.150 --> 08:00.830
We're going to have a justified content space between and 2.

08:01.110 --> 08:04.930
What I'm saying is once we get to 776.

08:05.100 --> 08:11.190
But before I show you an actual screen since you have flex ramp there are always going to be wrapping

08:11.200 --> 08:13.380
or here like this right on a new line.

08:13.380 --> 08:13.620
All right.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.200
So we're not going to be able to see.

08:15.390 --> 08:23.010
So what you need to do over here is we're going to say that for the skill we would want as a child to

08:23.010 --> 08:27.710
have flex 0 0 calc function.

08:27.890 --> 08:33.830
Right then we're going to have 50 percent minus and we're going to say 20 pixels or here like this.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.820
So we say this.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.120
And now let's check it out right now actually they are half the size on this.

08:42.150 --> 08:42.800
All right.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.760
And you can see what happens right.

08:44.850 --> 08:47.000
Once we have them on here.

08:47.040 --> 08:47.650
All right.

08:47.760 --> 08:52.530
And they are actually spanning the screen or here like this.

08:52.530 --> 08:59.370
Right now what we want to do is as we're going actually to a bigger screen right we would want actually

08:59.580 --> 09:00.960
a three of them right.

09:01.110 --> 09:04.100
And we would want the border or here like this right.

09:04.170 --> 09:09.490
So we're going to go back over here and we're going to say for media screen nine and two.

09:09.670 --> 09:10.320
All right.

09:10.320 --> 09:18.540
So when you say media and we're going to say screen and here we're going to say men with with or here

09:18.540 --> 09:19.130
right.

09:19.210 --> 09:23.040
I'm going to say nine nine two pixels on here like this.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.540
Now what should happen.

09:24.580 --> 09:25.140
Right.

09:25.290 --> 09:28.340
And we're here and we're going to say a little bit differently right.

09:28.380 --> 09:31.740
We already have skill center display flex flex wrap.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.380
All this is working fine.

09:33.430 --> 09:41.830
How are we going to write skill or here flex then we're going to write 0 0 and calc.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.340
And here we're going to write 3 3 3 3 3 percent on here right.

09:47.490 --> 09:48.300
Minus.

09:48.300 --> 09:52.160
And we're going to say one pixel and just so it's a little bit in between them.

09:52.170 --> 09:53.060
Right.

09:53.090 --> 10:00.370
And over here we're going to say first that the margin shouldn't be zero here all are home and padding

10:00.370 --> 10:06.840
bottom is going to be 20 panning Muharram it's going to be let's say 20 pixels here.

10:07.180 --> 10:08.470
So we are fresh.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.450
Right now we have three of them are here.

10:10.730 --> 10:14.370
And now let's go ahead and let's actually add the lines.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.070
All right.

10:15.070 --> 10:23.560
So I'm going to say here is that this is going to be a skills article here and I'm going to say first

10:23.560 --> 10:24.630
of type.

10:24.700 --> 10:25.320
All right.

10:25.420 --> 10:30.980
So I'm going to say article and we're going to say first of type and what I'm going to say here and

10:31.000 --> 10:35.840
this is going to be a border like border and we're going to say.

10:35.830 --> 10:41.200
Right and this is going to be one pixel solid and hashtag.

10:41.340 --> 10:44.230
EF 5 EF 3 5 0 0 0.

10:44.250 --> 10:45.090
All right.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.000
So let's check it out.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.420
What we have by the looks of it right.

10:48.430 --> 10:55.540
We shouldn't have it over here at this border right now after that what I would want to do is just have

10:55.630 --> 10:57.390
a type.

10:57.410 --> 10:59.980
Right so everything is going to be the same or here we would just.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.240
And F-Type.

11:01.240 --> 11:07.820
So I'm going to copy and paste this and here we're going to say this is going to be end of type and

11:07.990 --> 11:12.920
right and right and of type and I'm going to say we're here number three.

11:12.920 --> 11:16.380
All right so now we want to work with a third one.

11:16.470 --> 11:20.900
And over here I'm going to say border left is going to be one pixel solid.

11:21.070 --> 11:24.240
So I'm going to say your left here like this.

11:24.340 --> 11:29.090
Then once we have this then we would want to have a 4.

11:29.160 --> 11:32.060
So again if you see or hear or all right.

11:32.110 --> 11:40.360
So we have this guy right and this guy have work right now what he would want to select is number four

11:40.870 --> 11:42.010
right here.

11:42.150 --> 11:42.640
Right.

11:42.850 --> 11:47.860
And for number four we would want a border top and border right.

11:47.930 --> 11:49.310
And it's all here.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.680
So pretty much it works the same way it was going to be copying and pasting.

11:52.730 --> 11:53.310
Right.

11:53.410 --> 11:55.220
So I'm going to copy and paste this.

11:55.270 --> 11:58.760
This is going to be number four here.

11:58.840 --> 12:02.450
And this is going to be border right again.

12:02.530 --> 12:04.800
It's all going to say all right.

12:05.080 --> 12:10.740
And then we're going to copy and paste this and we're going to set it up saurian this is going to be

12:10.860 --> 12:12.620
the top.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.100
We're going to go back.

12:14.140 --> 12:19.910
Sure enough now we have these borders right now obviously we would need four to six and then four or

12:19.910 --> 12:20.600
five.

12:20.610 --> 12:21.050
All right.

12:21.130 --> 12:23.020
So what we're going to do here.

12:23.020 --> 12:25.320
We're just going to copy and paste this.

12:25.340 --> 12:25.560
Right.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.780
So one by one and we're going to go back over here.

12:28.810 --> 12:33.430
We're going to write six then this is going to be border left and work it up.

12:33.430 --> 12:38.680
So again we're going to change from right to left and then we'll have the last one is going to be number

12:38.680 --> 12:39.410
five.

12:39.770 --> 12:39.970
Right.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.310
So we're going to copy paste this.

12:42.310 --> 12:48.040
And for the skills number five what we would want is we would one just board it up so we can just get

12:48.040 --> 12:50.460
rid of this guy we're like this.

12:50.470 --> 12:59.500
So once we save this one we have right now we have a grid here imaginary grid meaning imaginary that
