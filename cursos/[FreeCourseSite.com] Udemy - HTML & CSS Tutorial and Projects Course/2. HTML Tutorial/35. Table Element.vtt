If in your project you were going to have to use some kind of table we also have an option of working

00:05.670 --> 00:08.110
with tables the nation email.

00:08.220 --> 00:09.390
Now before we do that.

00:09.630 --> 00:15.540
Now as always we'll need to get rid of this our list first and then let's start working with our table

00:15.630 --> 00:16.610
element.

00:16.620 --> 00:22.500
Now if you would have to guess how we would have to create the table element in an email with everything

00:22.500 --> 00:23.630
that we already know of.

00:24.480 --> 00:28.620
Well I think you probably guessed that correctly where you said well first we're gonna have to create

00:28.710 --> 00:34.200
the table element and then obviously for each and every table we would have the rows.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.470
Um well as we would have the columns.

00:36.490 --> 00:36.730
Right.

00:37.170 --> 00:42.690
So in order to create a row we would need to create a row element and then one in a row.

00:42.690 --> 00:44.650
This is where we would create our data.

00:44.730 --> 00:47.270
And again whatever columns we would like to create.

00:47.430 --> 00:53.070
Meaning if you would want to have 10000 columns more you would have four columns.

00:53.070 --> 00:59.320
The same thing would work where we would have the table data element and then within the table data.

00:59.370 --> 01:01.560
This is where we write our information.

01:01.650 --> 01:05.830
Again let's just have some kind of dummy text we the john.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.830
This is gonna be my table data.

01:07.830 --> 01:15.240
So if we're gonna copy and paste it again and let's say the second one would be Peter then again Sarah.

01:15.360 --> 01:18.150
And again for the agency melted Oriel.

01:18.270 --> 01:22.220
I don't see the point of coming up with some kind of exclusive examples.

01:22.290 --> 01:25.840
This is just going to give you a general understanding of what's happening.

01:26.050 --> 01:32.280
So the moment table data is I'm gonna be adding meaning the more columns I'm going to be adding then

01:32.460 --> 01:35.210
I see the more columns are going to be displayed.

01:35.220 --> 01:41.310
Now we also have an option of having the table headings so in our case we're gonna have let's say TR

01:41.790 --> 01:50.190
and within the first table roll we have a element of the H which will stand for table head and within

01:50.190 --> 01:53.350
the table head we can write again whatever we would like.

01:53.370 --> 01:57.420
I'm just gonna say here's some info and we're going to copy and paste it.

01:57.610 --> 02:05.260
And now I'm gonna have three table headings as well as three regular columns in the second row and if

02:05.260 --> 02:11.650
I would like to create more rows I would just have to create again new row element and just keep on

02:11.650 --> 02:13.390
adding the table data element.
