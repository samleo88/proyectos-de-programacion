00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,589
Hello everyone and welcome to the Python course that we're going to be doing. My

2

00:00:04,589  -->  00:00:08,220
name is Nick and i'm going to be the
instructor for this course, and it's

3

00:00:08,220  -->  00:00:12,210
going to be my job to get you completely
immersed in the Python programming

4

00:00:12,210  -->  00:00:18,240
language. Now, this course is going to be
aimed at somebody who may have basic

5

00:00:18,240  -->  00:00:22,470
knowledge about what a programming
language is but this would be your first

6

00:00:22,470  -->  00:00:26,699
programming language, and this is a great programming language to start with. It

7

00:00:26,699  -->  00:00:30,300
does have some limitations and sometimes this is not the right tool for the job,

8

00:00:30,300  -->  00:00:36,390
but a lot of times this offers people
who have no experience programming a

9

00:00:36,390  -->  00:00:40,410
really great way of understanding what a
programming language is and how to use

10

00:00:40,410  -->  00:00:45,899
one. So, the main differences between
Python and other languages like C++, or C,

11

00:00:45,899  -->  00:00:55,410
or Java is that Python is built around
two main focal points which I believe

12

00:00:55,410  -->  00:01:03,090
are code readability and simplicity. So,
we're gonna jump into the

13

00:01:03,090  -->  00:01:08,130
language here and in a few videos but we
need to do a few things first. First we

14

00:01:08,130  -->  00:01:14,310
need to discuss what Python is, and then
we need to get it installed, and then we

15

00:01:14,310  -->  00:01:19,560
can start discussing you know what's an
interpreter, how do you run a

16

00:01:19,560  -->  00:01:25,259
Python script, and then get into the
language itself. Now, the language is

17

00:01:25,259  -->  00:01:30,420
different but it's easy, and once we get
past an understanding of how the

18

00:01:30,420  -->  00:01:33,689
programming language works, and the
syntax, and all the different stuff you

19

00:01:33,689  -->  00:01:34,710
do with it,

20

00:01:34,710  -->  00:01:41,189
we're going to move on to actually
programming real applications and

21

00:01:41,189  -->  00:01:46,170
showing you guys different practical
applications of the python programming

22

00:01:46,170  -->  00:01:50,130
language. So, for instance, we're going to
be building a website,

23

00:01:51,119  -->  00:01:57,869
we're going to be building a web scraper,
and a graphical utility we're actually

24

00:01:57,869  -->  00:02:01,560
going to be building multiple graphical
tools because there are a few different

25

00:02:01,560  -->  00:02:06,600
graphical or GUI, GUI, whatever you want
to call it there's a few different

26

00:02:06,600  -->  00:02:09,629
frameworks for Python that we could use.

27

00:02:09,629  -->  00:02:12,750
So we're going to explore three of them. So,

28

00:02:13,319  -->  00:02:18,150
right off the bat here's a fun fact if
you didn't know python is actually named

29

00:02:18,150  -->  00:02:23,129
after Monty Python who's made some great films, so if you if you haven't seen

30

00:02:23,129  -->  00:02:26,879
Search for the Holy Grail or the Life of
Brian go do it,

31

00:02:28,170  -->  00:02:31,170
they're great movies, which is completely
beside the point.

32

00:02:31,769  -->  00:02:37,019
So, Python is actually a pretty old
programming language. It was first

33

00:02:37,019  -->  00:02:41,069
introduced in 1991 which makes it 25
years old.

34

00:02:41,909  -->  00:02:47,609
There's two current versions, now this
may be confusing as well, so there's a

35

00:02:47,609  -->  00:02:54,090
Python 2 series and there's a Python 3
series. The Python 2 is currently at 2.7.11

36

00:02:54,090  -->  00:03:00,000
and the 3 series is at 3.5.1. Now we're going to be

37

00:03:00,000  -->  00:03:06,419
using Python 3 in this course however
Python 2 shouldn't be much different if

38

00:03:06,419  -->  00:03:11,489
afterwards you want to explore using
Python 2 that's completely acceptable.

39

00:03:11,489  -->  00:03:20,340
Now as I said Python is based around
simplicity and readability and this

40

00:03:20,340  -->  00:03:25,169
means that when you look at Python code
it's all indentation based. So, if you

41

00:03:25,169  -->  00:03:29,489
looked at another code like Java you would see a lot of curly braces, and brackets, and a

42

00:03:29,489  -->  00:03:37,109
lot of things that are just there to
confuse the the novice programmer. Python

43

00:03:37,109  -->  00:03:41,310
is based on indentation so you don't
need to wrap blocks of code in curly

44

00:03:41,310  -->  00:03:45,959
braces and you guys will see what I mean
coming up in the next few

45

00:03:45,959  -->  00:03:51,419
videos. So, that's all we're going to talk
about today. I hope you guys enjoy this

46

00:03:51,419  -->  00:03:53,040
course and find it useful.
