WEBVTT

00:00.520 --> 00:07.500
To start things off let's work on our setup essentially let's create our Flex box sandbox where we can

00:07.500 --> 00:12.780
practice flex box properties while the video is not going to be long.

00:12.870 --> 00:15.170
If you don't feel like working on a setup.

00:15.360 --> 00:20.760
Feel free to skip it altogether and just download the files from the video resources.

00:20.760 --> 00:24.660
So let's start by creating a folder.

00:24.840 --> 00:30.580
I'm going to do that in desktop so always you can do it wherever you'd like.

00:30.690 --> 00:37.860
I'm going to rename it to be legs box to trial something like that.

00:38.520 --> 00:44.610
Now once I have my folder I'm going to head over to my favorite text editor which is ladies and gentlemen.

00:44.620 --> 00:50.850
Visual Studio code and then of course I'm gonna drag and drop that folder in the Visual Studio code

00:51.030 --> 00:58.490
all right now within the Visual Studio code let's create index each demo index and them all file.

00:58.540 --> 01:02.130
Let's also right away create our HDMI skeleton.

01:02.150 --> 01:06.270
And again I'm using in fact Emmett that comes with Visual Studio code.

01:06.270 --> 01:13.110
So again I just get an exclamation mark and I'm done as well as I would like to have a new file by the

01:13.110 --> 01:16.030
name of Stiles CSX.

01:16.500 --> 01:17.900
Now that's number one.

01:17.910 --> 01:24.180
Then let's open up a new browser window like so when I said it side by side.

01:24.180 --> 01:25.120
Now you don't have to.

01:25.170 --> 01:26.540
You can keep yours once.

01:26.550 --> 01:32.010
Pretty much separate and just use the bigger one but I'm gonna use two of them when I have a smaller

01:32.010 --> 01:37.560
one side by side all the time with lectures and the bigger one when let's say we would like to take

01:37.560 --> 01:43.930
a closer look at how some kind of see assess or flex box properly looks on a bigger browser window all

01:44.030 --> 01:48.180
right now as far as index age the amount is concerned.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.980
What do we would like to do.

01:50.010 --> 01:59.940
Well I have my documents so why don't we rename it and let's say legs box tutorial like so then after

01:59.940 --> 02:05.980
the title we're gonna set up right away link because I would like to link to stars.

02:05.990 --> 02:10.610
SS So lets go with link and let's look for styles.

02:10.620 --> 02:16.280
SS Right now I also like to serve the style tax and you'll see in a second why not.

02:16.410 --> 02:17.900
For now I'm just gonna leave them blank.

02:17.910 --> 02:22.740
But in the second you'll see why we're doing the work now within the body.

02:22.740 --> 02:24.770
This is what we're going to do.

02:24.930 --> 02:28.250
I'm gonna set up a container with few boxes.

02:28.320 --> 02:34.150
No there's multiple ways how we can do that but I'm gonna go right away with Emmett where I'm gonna

02:34.170 --> 02:41.910
say that there's gonna be let's say div with class of box then since I'm gonna create multiple of them

02:42.210 --> 02:48.060
I'm going to say that each and every day is going to have box then hyphen and then I'm going to look

02:48.060 --> 02:49.030
for the dollars.

02:49.530 --> 02:54.580
And then within that particular div most are gonna place a dollar sign as well.

02:54.660 --> 02:59.130
And I would like to multiply that all by five and you'll see in a second how it's going to look like

02:59.470 --> 03:04.170
by the way as you can see the suggestion right away it gives us and then this is what I have.

03:04.380 --> 03:10.680
And like I said we could have created this of course by writing manually box and then box number 1 but

03:10.930 --> 03:13.720
it's also need to use the Flex boxer.

03:13.770 --> 03:19.620
Now I'm gonna place all these boxes within the container so there's going to be a container and let's

03:19.620 --> 03:23.680
just move this particular div all the way to the bottom.

03:23.700 --> 03:29.100
So now I have my container and then I have my boxes and you'll see in second why we're doing that.

03:29.100 --> 03:36.810
But at the moment right now I would like to in fact open up my life server and I have multiple extensions

03:36.810 --> 03:37.800
that can do that.

03:37.800 --> 03:43.330
Remember we have the live server where we had the V.S. code preview server.

03:43.830 --> 03:47.960
So I'm going to go with the second one and there you go.

03:47.970 --> 03:53.820
These are my boxes and again just to head over back to my extensions just to show you that if I had

03:53.820 --> 03:58.290
0 2 extensions I have two of them that use in fact life server.

03:58.290 --> 04:04.410
So I have preview on a web server and life server at the moment I'm using the second one the preview

04:04.410 --> 04:05.280
on a web server.

04:05.330 --> 04:08.960
But of course it's really up to you which one you choose to use.

04:08.970 --> 04:09.240
All right.

04:09.690 --> 04:12.980
Now let's close the sidebar for a second.

04:12.990 --> 04:18.960
Then I have my boxes I have my style see ISIS not looks all good.

04:19.020 --> 04:25.770
So now I can close the indexation email as well as the welcome and let's just work in styles.

04:25.800 --> 04:26.320
Yes.

04:26.730 --> 04:30.570
So as far as style C assess let's just add some basic styles.

04:30.570 --> 04:32.300
So let's start with the body.

04:32.610 --> 04:38.080
And I'm going to go with one family and I'm going to set it up as a verb Donna.

04:38.940 --> 04:41.160
Then let's add a little bit of background.

04:41.340 --> 04:45.860
Let's go with background hashtag EF 3 EF 3 of 3.

04:45.870 --> 04:50.850
So essentially it's a red color name then for a container.

04:50.850 --> 04:57.450
I'm gonna add some water just so we can see how few legs box properties or maybe how all flex blocks

04:57.480 --> 05:06.280
properties essentially act is just gonna give us a good idea how our boxes are behaving within our container.

05:06.280 --> 05:06.800
OK.

05:07.030 --> 05:15.480
Now I'm going to set it up as more five pixels solid red and like so as you can see that is my container.

05:15.670 --> 05:17.730
And these are my boxes.

05:17.840 --> 05:20.900
Then let's create some styles for all the boxes.

05:20.920 --> 05:26.930
And remember we can nervously do that because we do have our indexation email and within the indexation

05:26.970 --> 05:30.570
email each and every day of has this box class.

05:30.820 --> 05:37.790
So when I'm applying styles for this box less well all of them all the boxes are gonna have those styles.

05:38.010 --> 05:43.990
However there's gonna be some specific styles more specifically colours that are gonna be applied only

05:43.990 --> 05:45.370
to a specific box.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.560
Right now within the style C assessed.

05:47.550 --> 05:52.160
Like I said Let's select all the boxes and that's number one.

05:52.160 --> 06:02.260
Well let's go with padding 30 pixels then we're gonna set up some text line next on line let's say center.

06:02.410 --> 06:10.240
Then also why don't we increase the font size font size and we're gonna go with 35 pixels.

06:10.300 --> 06:15.170
And lastly the color is going to be the same one as for the body.

06:15.190 --> 06:20.440
Now that was again hashtag EF 3 EF 3 EF 3 OK.

06:20.570 --> 06:23.680
Like so now currently we can of course see anything.

06:24.040 --> 06:28.970
We have a giant numbers there but since they are the same color as the background while we cannot see

06:28.970 --> 06:29.080
it.

06:29.350 --> 06:33.100
So that's the time when we're going to add some background colors as well.

06:33.250 --> 06:39.800
So let's start with box number one box number one and the color is going to be followed.

06:39.940 --> 06:45.730
So we're gonna set up a background property and here let's go with hashtag.

06:45.740 --> 06:51.720
5 8 then 1 and we have f 1 8.

06:51.820 --> 06:52.200
OK.

06:52.270 --> 06:53.050
Something like that.

06:53.440 --> 06:58.300
That's my box number one and what I'm going to do right now is in fact copy and paste it.

06:58.300 --> 07:01.540
So 1 2 3 4.

07:01.690 --> 07:04.320
Like so this should be five boxes.

07:04.390 --> 07:06.320
Let's just change these values here.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.320
So it's going to be box number two.

07:09.500 --> 07:16.410
This one is three and one is already four and then we have the five.

07:17.050 --> 07:23.940
And the only thing really that we need to do is in fact change these values for the X colors.

07:24.550 --> 07:29.820
Let's go with f 0 a two or two.

07:30.190 --> 07:41.580
So our yellow color let's say it then third one is the orange one so these nine five D five D and three

07:41.590 --> 07:42.460
nine.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.200
Okay that's our orange color.

07:44.200 --> 07:50.960
Then we have blue and green as far as blue is concerned 2 0 2 see.

07:51.070 --> 07:51.920
Five.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.000
Nine.

07:53.100 --> 07:53.900
So.

07:53.950 --> 07:56.260
And then lastly like I said Green.

07:56.530 --> 08:03.380
And we're gonna go with five one C B 20 and that's it.

08:03.370 --> 08:07.300
We're essentially done with our setup and rest of the work.

08:07.300 --> 08:12.590
In fact as we're working with the flux box and we're gonna do within style tax.

08:12.610 --> 08:16.870
And even though normally you're not going to do that of course all your ships.

08:16.890 --> 08:23.200
This is going to be let's say in one file or you're going to set up separate them in separate C Ss forms.

08:23.200 --> 08:28.750
The only reason why we're going to do it this way is very simple where I would like to separate the

08:28.750 --> 08:34.630
concerns where I would like to write all the C S as properties or I'm sorry hold the Flex blocks properties

08:35.140 --> 08:39.850
in a separate place so that way you're not confused Hey listen you know we have these styles and then

08:39.850 --> 08:41.750
we have some other flexible styles.

08:41.860 --> 08:48.380
Plus I don't have to switch screens so essentially we're gonna have a C Ss on the top and then all our

08:48.390 --> 08:49.790
HDMI on the bottom.

08:49.810 --> 08:55.390
Now there might be some cases where I'm going to switch back to style C Asus but most of the work and

08:55.390 --> 09:01.310
most of the styles as far as flex box is concerned we're going to write within these style attacks.

09:01.380 --> 09:04.210
That said guys congrats we're done with our setup.
