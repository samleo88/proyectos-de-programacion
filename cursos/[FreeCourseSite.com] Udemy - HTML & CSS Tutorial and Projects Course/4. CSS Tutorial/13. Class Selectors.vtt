00:00.510 --> 00:01.260
Excellent.

00:01.260 --> 00:05.610
We know how to use the I.D. selectors but see assess our offers.

00:05.640 --> 00:12.530
Also something really cool called Class selectors so where we would use these bad boys as always we're

00:12.540 --> 00:18.740
gonna start by getting rid of what we had in the previous video and let's say in indexation IMO we're

00:18.750 --> 00:23.040
gonna change this around a little bit so I'm gonna say that I'm gonna get rid of all my headings and

00:23.040 --> 00:25.580
everything and I would just like to work with.

00:25.610 --> 00:30.260
I don't know having three and again it doesn't really matter what kind of elements we're creating.

00:30.270 --> 00:32.220
The whole point is gonna be working with classes.

00:32.940 --> 00:38.560
So let's say there is going to be adding three and I'm gonna call this I am gonna have green.

00:38.610 --> 00:40.230
So that would be a green hat.

00:40.650 --> 00:47.330
Now within the second heading the other having three I'm gonna say well you know what I am red.

00:47.390 --> 00:50.670
So those are gonna be my two headings so I can save this.

00:50.780 --> 00:51.360
And you know what.

00:51.360 --> 00:55.050
We can just select them both and copy and paste a few times.

00:55.140 --> 01:01.710
So let's say that there is gonna be six headings total three of them are gonna be green and three of

01:01.710 --> 01:03.070
them are gonna be red.

01:03.180 --> 01:05.780
Now as I'm looking at it I really can see that.

01:05.940 --> 01:06.830
Yeah everything is fine.

01:06.840 --> 01:07.830
So I have red red red.

01:08.370 --> 01:09.720
Everything is correct.

01:09.720 --> 01:13.740
Now how do I actually style them green or red.

01:13.800 --> 01:18.300
Well you can say we could use the I.D. right because we cannot select them all.

01:18.450 --> 01:22.140
I cannot do like this because otherwise this is not going to make sense.

01:22.140 --> 01:25.740
I'm going to style them but all of them are going to be exactly the same.

01:25.770 --> 01:30.870
So if I'm gonna write color green all of them are gonna be green and if I'm gonna write color red all

01:30.870 --> 01:32.720
of them are gonna be color red.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.580
So what would be the solution.

01:35.050 --> 01:41.220
Well you can say OK we can go back and we can start adding the I.D. we can say I don't know maybe one

01:41.350 --> 01:41.670
right.

01:41.670 --> 01:48.270
So this would be number one then number two three four and then go back yeah you could technically do

01:48.270 --> 01:51.270
this but that probably wouldn't be the fastest way.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.700
There's actually a better way now would be using the class now.

01:54.810 --> 02:02.580
Class is gonna be again attribute on our HMO and safe self-explanatory the name is gonna be class.

02:02.580 --> 02:08.270
So class selectors would be using the class attribute and again for a class attribute we would need

02:08.270 --> 02:09.600
to right the value.

02:09.600 --> 02:15.080
Now this is not the best naming convention I can tell you right away naming is green and we'll gonna

02:15.090 --> 02:21.900
cover this a lot in the project but for now let's just go with class of green where for every heading

02:21.900 --> 02:25.530
that I would like to have green I'm going gonna have this class of green.

02:25.920 --> 02:31.140
So instead of using that is we're going to create a class and for every hearing.

02:31.140 --> 02:33.250
Like I said that I would like to have green.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.490
I'm going to copy and paste this and add the value of green.

02:36.720 --> 02:39.570
Now for all the red ones I'm gonna change it.

02:39.570 --> 02:41.220
I'm not gonna say green.

02:41.220 --> 02:43.050
I'm going to use a red.

02:43.090 --> 02:50.050
So again let me select this value for this guy and let's say for the red one copy paste and for the

02:50.050 --> 02:51.060
last one the same.

02:51.640 --> 02:54.110
Now how do we select them and see as though.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.170
So we'll head over back and we're gonna get rid of the string three.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.060
I'm not interested in this.

02:59.260 --> 03:04.730
And now instead of the hash tag that we used for the 80s we need to use that.

03:04.840 --> 03:10.930
This is how we can select classes and again we need to write the name of the class and don't write Grandma

03:10.940 --> 03:14.580
Madea because you do have this class in your document.

03:14.590 --> 03:17.580
Well maybe you do have in yours but I don't have in mind.

03:17.870 --> 03:21.950
So in my case we're gonna write Green and now I again I can write whatever I would like.

03:22.290 --> 03:28.630
So in our case since this is gonna be best visual example we're gonna use green and what happens.

03:28.810 --> 03:33.010
Only the headings that have a class of green turn green.

03:33.010 --> 03:34.090
Simple enough.

03:34.090 --> 03:40.810
Now it's covering paste this let's say we're gonna select not the green bar instead we're gonna work

03:40.810 --> 03:41.880
with red.

03:42.190 --> 03:43.120
And what happens.

03:43.120 --> 03:47.590
Well we're gonna light let's say color red and also background.

03:47.590 --> 03:52.180
I don't know grey background is gonna be grey.

03:52.330 --> 03:54.130
Now what do you think is gonna happen in this case.

03:54.760 --> 04:01.570
So only the classes that were added to the hiring freeze with the value of Red were styled this way.

04:02.080 --> 04:07.680
So this is all we can use class directors in C assess and they are very very powerful.
