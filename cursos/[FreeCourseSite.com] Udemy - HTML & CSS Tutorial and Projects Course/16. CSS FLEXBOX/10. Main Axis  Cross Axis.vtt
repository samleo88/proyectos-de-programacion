00:00.590 --> 00:07.790
One last thing that I would like to cover before we start working with Flex items properties is main

00:07.790 --> 00:13.560
axes and cross axes and how in fact is going to affect your layout.

00:13.610 --> 00:21.800
First and foremost I'm gonna show you a nice representation where when we have a flex box rule our main

00:21.800 --> 00:27.780
axis is going horizontal and our cross axis is in fact going vertically.

00:28.250 --> 00:36.110
However when we switch the Flex box column remember that was done by using flex direction where we set

00:36.110 --> 00:43.530
it up to where column our main axis easy in fact vertical and our cross axis is going horizontal.

00:43.550 --> 00:49.040
Now let me also show you example where you're going to see that in action.

00:49.350 --> 00:53.780
Now first and foremost I don't think I need these generic boxes.

00:53.870 --> 00:55.820
That's number one.

00:55.820 --> 01:03.320
Then also let's create another container and let's just do simply by container number one.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.150
Okay.

01:04.250 --> 01:08.570
And I'm also going to place all the same boxes in here.

01:08.570 --> 01:10.190
We're not going to be very original.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.030
So I have my second container.

01:12.340 --> 01:18.850
However for my second container the container number one I'm going to add a different border.

01:19.100 --> 01:26.810
So when you say container number one I'm also gonna add a little bit of more height let's go with 800

01:26.860 --> 01:28.120
pixels.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.330
Like so that's my container number one.

01:31.390 --> 01:39.860
Then let's add like I said another border border five pixels solid below like so.

01:39.870 --> 01:44.470
And lastly let's do a display flex display flex.

01:44.470 --> 01:52.800
However in this case remember we have our default on flux direction is set to 0 or in our case.

01:52.810 --> 01:57.280
I'm gonna go with Alex direction and we're gonna go with Carl here.

01:57.730 --> 02:05.260
Now let's imagine this scenario where I would like to place my atoms in a center horizontally and also

02:05.260 --> 02:06.230
vertically.

02:06.220 --> 02:07.980
Well no big deal right.

02:07.990 --> 02:12.220
We know we have just very content and we go with center correct.

02:12.250 --> 02:13.400
That's number one.

02:13.420 --> 02:17.550
So for our first container they're sitting horizontally innocent.

02:18.130 --> 02:24.280
And also we have a line items and that one is of course responsible for vertical line.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.690
And again we just set them up in a center.

02:26.710 --> 02:29.380
So everything works just like we planned.

02:29.540 --> 02:37.690
However what if our like to do the same thing with my container no one does in fact has the Flex direction

02:37.690 --> 02:38.400
of column.

02:38.650 --> 02:40.160
So how it's going to work.

02:40.420 --> 02:45.820
Well we know already that in order to place them let's say vertically what is the property.

02:45.850 --> 02:50.080
Well there is a line items and then a line item is innocent.

02:50.680 --> 02:57.340
However you're going to notice something really really interesting where for my flex direction of column

02:57.760 --> 03:01.340
we did not set them right now vertically in the center.

03:01.390 --> 03:05.010
In fact we set them up actually horizontal in the center.

03:05.050 --> 03:12.010
And the reason for that because again our axis change where our Flex blocks row at the main act is going

03:12.010 --> 03:13.450
here horizontally.

03:13.450 --> 03:20.710
Our flex box column has the main axis going in fact vertically and that's the reason if I would want

03:20.710 --> 03:27.930
to place it vertically in the center instead of on line items I would need to use justify content.

03:27.930 --> 03:34.660
And in this case once I set it up in fact justify content equal to center then I place them in fact

03:35.350 --> 03:36.700
vertically in a center.

03:36.730 --> 03:44.290
So please keep in mind when you're going to work with Flex box please keep in mind which is your flex

03:44.290 --> 03:50.290
direction whatever it is that column and if it is a column then your main axis changed right.

03:50.590 --> 03:55.720
So then the properties that you had previously for the role while you need to keep in mind which one

03:55.720 --> 03:58.840
is your main axis in which one is your cross axis.

03:59.200 --> 04:06.170
And that way you can in fact avoid any kind of confusion which would happen if you're trying to place

04:06.170 --> 04:11.470
something horizontal in the center and you know what it is not work you are actually in fact placing

04:11.470 --> 04:12.760
it vertically.

04:13.090 --> 04:17.440
So that's something you need to keep in mind when you work when the Flex box that there is something

04:17.440 --> 04:19.420
called main axis and cross axis.

04:19.570 --> 04:22.930
And it does change when you change your flex direction.
