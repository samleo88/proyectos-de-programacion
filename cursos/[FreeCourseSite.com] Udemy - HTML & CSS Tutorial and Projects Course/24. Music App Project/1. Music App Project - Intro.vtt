00:00.060 --> 00:05.700
What is going on guys and welcome to our next project and this project we're going to be creating a

00:05.700 --> 00:09.160
music app so you can see we're here we're going to have a logo.

00:09.190 --> 00:13.170
We're here with links on the site over here.

00:13.220 --> 00:17.490
We're going to have all here a button and actually hides in a bar.

00:17.730 --> 00:21.260
And once we click it again tax actual number shows up.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.020
Then over here these are going to be awesome.

00:24.210 --> 00:27.570
And this is going to be the input this is going to be another image right.

00:27.570 --> 00:30.060
This is going to be the whole thing is going to be top notch.

00:30.510 --> 00:37.020
Then over here we're going to have a song list with a picture artist song and then we're going to have

00:37.020 --> 00:38.930
fun Tarsem icons over here.

00:39.270 --> 00:46.260
And then next we're going to be using a whole curso for our Here the artist in a song right.

00:46.270 --> 00:48.270
So these are going to be top songs.

00:48.270 --> 00:52.900
Now as I'm hovering over the image you'll see that I'll have icons showing up here right.

00:53.060 --> 00:57.940
And the actual images is going to be zooming in and again this is going to be the carousel and we're

00:57.950 --> 01:00.090
going to look at how we can customize it.

01:00.120 --> 01:07.340
And then over here once we go to the small screen or here the knob bar is going to disappear actually

01:07.350 --> 01:07.960
right.

01:07.970 --> 01:10.320
And over here we're going to have now borrow bottle here.

01:10.370 --> 01:10.930
Right.

01:11.010 --> 01:12.980
And again this is going to be the top now.

01:13.200 --> 01:17.200
Right now the button is going to be all here instead of all here right.

01:17.250 --> 01:21.350
So we're going to get rid of this button and there's going to be a button over here.

01:21.810 --> 01:27.350
And then again as I scroll down right Hogan-Howe we'll see that we're going to have the same map.

01:27.390 --> 01:30.400
So let's get going and let's start working on this project.
