00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:05,069
Hey guys, welcome back. So, now that we've learned how to actually build an

2

00:00:05,069  -->  00:00:07,500
application, it's still pretty bare,

3

00:00:07,500  -->  00:00:10,469
and so what we're going to be learning
about is templates and how to use them

4

00:00:10,469  -->  00:00:17,160
effectively. And so what we're going to
do is create a template here, and it's

5

00:00:17,160  -->  00:00:20,609
just going to be inside of a directory
so let's go ahead and create a directory

6

00:00:20,609  -->  00:00:30,119
called "resources" Now we're also going to be storing bootstrap here later on and

7

00:00:30,119  -->  00:00:34,469
so we're just going to create a new HTML
file in here and we're going to call it

8

00:00:34,469  -->  00:00:47,850
"main" and in here let's just type, I'm
going to type some HTML so that you guys

9

00:00:47,850  -->  00:00:50,850
can see basically what this is going to
look like.

10

00:00:51,420  -->  00:01:03,359
So let's create "&lt;h1&gt;Name: $name&lt;/h1&gt;"
and the way that you access the

11

00:01:03,359  -->  00:01:14,010
variables that you pass into this is
through the "$" there and so

12

00:01:14,010  -->  00:01:19,740
what we're going to do is we need to
actually import that into this HTML file

13

00:01:19,740  -->  00:01:26,130
and you do that as "$def with (name)" and then the variables that you're going to be

14

00:01:26,130  -->  00:01:28,020
capturing into this file.

15

00:01:28,020  -->  00:01:34,350
Let's go ahead and remove actually all this, just write it for right now just with

16

00:01:34,350  -->  00:01:46,470
HTML, and we're also going to be passing
along an age. So, your "&lt;p&gt;Your age is $age&lt;/p&gt;"

17

00:01:46,470  -->  00:01:55,110
What we need to do here is import ", age"
variable as well. So let's go ahead and save

18

00:01:55,110  -->  00:02:00,810
this. Now if we jump back over to our
main Python file we're going to actually

19

00:02:00,810  -->  00:02:06,119
have to tell Python where to find all
our templates, so let's go ahead and type

20

00:02:06,119  -->  00:02:11,940
"render = web.template.render"

21

00:02:12,510  -->  00:02:22,799
and tell it to look in the "("resources/")" Now, when we create

22

00:02:22,799  -->  00:02:29,849
the, when we create the function down
here, what we actually need to do is we

23

00:02:29,849  -->  00:02:37,829
need to "return render.main" and our files
called main so we're going to put the name

24

00:02:37,829  -->  00:02:42,569
of the file, and then we're going to
capture the variables "(name, age)" in

25

00:02:42,569  -->  00:02:49,049
here. Now we need to extend this a little
further to also pass name/age into here.

26

00:02:49,769  -->  00:02:57,269
So what we're going to do put another "/" and that right there  "(.*)"

27

00:02:58,079  -->  00:03:02,579
We're going to go ahead and save that, so
what we should be able to do now is

28

00:03:02,579  -->  00:03:08,849
access nick/ and then my age, it's to come here it's going to run this method right

29

00:03:08,849  -->  00:03:12,900
here within the index class because
again we're telling it to look for the

30

00:03:12,900  -->  00:03:20,129
index class if this URL is accessed. It's
going to render the main HTML file,

31

00:03:20,129  -->  00:03:22,199
and let's just run it and see,

32

00:03:22,199  -->  00:03:31,530
stop that there, run it again, we're
say that as you can see this is

33

00:03:31,530  -->  00:03:38,340
Name: Nick, Your age is 27. So just a little
note if you're wondering how can we get

34

00:03:38,340  -->  00:03:42,030
them in these names if we're not
specifying the name of each variable,

35

00:03:42,030  -->  00:03:46,709
this is going to be the first argument
here, and this is going to become the

36

00:03:46,709  -->  00:03:48,449
second argument here.

37

00:03:48,449  -->  00:03:53,669
So, again, if we wanted a third one we'd
have to pass them in the same order into

38

00:03:53,669  -->  00:04:00,510
this function in order to name them and
then use them elsewhere. Now, again we're

39

00:04:00,510  -->  00:04:04,560
going to define this with these two
variables, so you need to name the

40

00:04:04,560  -->  00:04:09,629
variables that you're pushing into this
render method, you need to push those

41

00:04:09,629  -->  00:04:14,790
down to the HTML file, and then use them
by using dollar side proceeding that

42

00:04:14,790  -->  00:04:20,880
variable name. And that is how to
get a basic template setup and we're

43

00:04:20,880  -->  00:04:23,610
going to be following this a little
further as well, actually what we're

44

00:04:23,610  -->  00:04:25,340
going to be doing we're going to be
setting up

45

00:04:25,340  -->  00:04:30,169
Mongo to this web application that we're creating.
