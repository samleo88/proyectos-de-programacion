00:00.450 --> 00:06.660
Thankfully position relative is much more exciting than the position static and maybe we can test it

00:06.660 --> 00:06.840
out.

00:07.170 --> 00:10.730
So we have right now maybe the the class of 1.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.350
So we have a date with the class one man.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.350
We can I think work on this guy.

00:15.360 --> 00:20.190
So let's say we have position and we already know that we have an option for the static.

00:20.260 --> 00:22.800
Now the moment we save it was position relative.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.630
You notice nothing changes.

00:24.660 --> 00:26.470
We might be tempted to say no.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.050
Okay so it's pretty much like.

00:28.290 --> 00:35.190
However you would be a tiny bit wrong because with a position relative what we can do is we can set

00:35.190 --> 00:42.100
it relative to its normal position so whenever it was sitting normal in flow we can actually adjust

00:42.100 --> 00:42.740
that.

00:42.750 --> 00:46.830
Now we can do that with four properties and the first one is gonna be top.

00:46.860 --> 00:50.610
So let's say relative to a top port was.

00:50.790 --> 00:55.620
So in our case what we can do we can say I don't know for example 50 pixels.

00:55.630 --> 01:03.010
What happens is I move that 50 pixels away from where it was sitting relatively with its normal position.

01:03.100 --> 01:07.740
So now it's sitting basically 50 percent or I'm sorry 50 pixels down.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.550
Now it can use multiple values here.

01:09.550 --> 01:11.790
We can say let's say maybe arms.

01:11.820 --> 01:20.400
So for the left one I'm going to use like 20 arms so not only going to place it 50 pixels down relative

01:20.400 --> 01:22.070
to where it was normally.

01:22.160 --> 01:28.890
Also will all gonna do 20 hour games left from where it was sitting relatively now since I would like

01:28.890 --> 01:32.440
to use multiple values I'm going to say at an all right.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.330
He's gonna be now.

01:33.330 --> 01:39.830
I don't know 50 percent and I was then this is gonna be more so now we are also using this top one.

01:40.020 --> 01:45.090
So maybe that wouldn't be the best example where we have already left one and then we're using the right

01:45.090 --> 01:45.610
one.

01:45.720 --> 01:46.730
So why don't we do this.

01:46.730 --> 01:49.960
Why don't we come on this out and now we're going to move it to the right.

01:50.160 --> 01:57.610
Now this way we're pushing it relatively to where it was sitting normally 50 percent from the right.

01:57.660 --> 02:02.250
Now also we have the bottom so we could push it from the bottom and again within doing the same thing

02:02.250 --> 02:07.230
where top is gonna be commented out and then we're going to work with the bottom line for the bottom.

02:07.230 --> 02:07.710
I don't know.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.650
We had our yams we had percent.

02:09.780 --> 02:11.570
I guess we can again do with the pixels.

02:11.590 --> 02:12.930
Doesn't really matter.

02:12.930 --> 02:17.360
So I can just say to two hundred pixels and now we pretty much moved it away from the screen.

02:17.850 --> 02:20.190
So maybe let's not be that drastic.

02:20.550 --> 02:27.750
We can also do 20 pixels and now we just move 20 pixels relative of where it was sitting up because

02:27.750 --> 02:30.490
moved it 20 pixels from the bottom.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.380
And that's how we can work with position relative in the same.
