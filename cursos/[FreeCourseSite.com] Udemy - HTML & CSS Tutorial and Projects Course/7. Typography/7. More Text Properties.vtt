WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:00.670
You know what.

00:00.700 --> 00:05.890
I changed my mind just because I would like to be done covering the tax properties.

00:05.920 --> 00:11.190
We're gonna cover five properties in this video and then we can move on to the next module.

00:11.190 --> 00:13.820
How are we gonna do a little bit of spring cleaning.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.820
So first I'm gonna get rid of the Google fonts.

00:17.070 --> 00:20.120
Then as well we're gonna get her of rest of the styles.

00:20.320 --> 00:27.060
I'm gonna delete them and within the next session email let's do a little bit of different setup where

00:27.210 --> 00:27.930
we again.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.440
I just want to delete everything and we're gonna start from scratch.

00:30.900 --> 00:35.050
So first I would like to create a link and then we can create this dummy link.

00:35.100 --> 00:39.760
So if this link is not going to work going anywhere we can just add a hashtag and we're good to go.

00:39.970 --> 00:44.860
And let's right over here let's say Google is gonna be a link which is not gonna go anywhere.

00:45.210 --> 00:55.870
And then we're all gonna have one having one and we're gonna say Hey I am I am the main heading something

00:55.870 --> 00:56.290
like this.

00:56.290 --> 01:00.050
Main heading lets say this and see what we have.

01:00.050 --> 01:01.760
This is going to be your main heading.

01:01.760 --> 01:06.520
And then we can have two paragraphs with let's say each of them class of one two three.

01:06.690 --> 01:08.200
First let's create a paragraph.

01:08.210 --> 01:11.000
This paragraph is gonna be Laura I'm on.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.100
Twenty five.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.820
I actually want multiple lines.

01:13.870 --> 01:15.520
So that's kind of my important thing.

01:15.790 --> 01:18.180
I think three lines is more enough.

01:18.270 --> 01:19.190
I'm just gonna say here.

01:19.190 --> 01:20.140
Class.

01:20.270 --> 01:21.810
Class is gonna be number one.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.970
And now we'd like to copy and paste this.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.520
So I'm gonna select all of this on one too.

01:26.660 --> 01:29.910
So there's gonna be paragraph where the class of number two.

01:29.930 --> 01:34.150
You know what I can just use the multiple sectors deleted here.

01:34.340 --> 01:38.450
Then head over back to my class number two.

01:38.510 --> 01:39.960
That class actually.

01:40.430 --> 01:43.090
Let's say that class is going to be number two.

01:43.310 --> 01:47.340
And then for a third guy this is gonna be the class of number three.

01:47.360 --> 01:53.440
Again not very original but this is gonna do a job now within the tiles.

01:53.470 --> 01:54.430
Yes yes.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.630
We're gonna start by simply looking at the line right now.

01:57.650 --> 02:03.290
The line high is going to control how the lines have the space in between them.

02:03.650 --> 02:06.670
So let's start out on the paragraph number one.

02:06.770 --> 02:08.220
And here let's write.

02:08.240 --> 02:13.690
Line height property since that is obviously the names that we're looking for and for the line height.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.210
This is gonna be relative.

02:15.620 --> 02:20.630
Again at the moment we haven't set it up and anything that the parent which would be the body but in

02:20.630 --> 02:22.850
general this is gonna be relative to something.

02:22.850 --> 02:25.400
So at the moment this is gonna be relative to the browser.

02:25.400 --> 02:31.610
So we're gonna say one point five M's notice right down my line heights are getting bigger don't believe

02:31.610 --> 02:31.850
me.

02:31.850 --> 02:36.530
Let's try 2.5 and you'll see that right now I have way bigger line height.

02:36.980 --> 02:40.480
But again if we're going to change this somewhere in the body or the parent element let's say there

02:40.480 --> 02:46.960
is gonna be div then this is going to depend again of how we're controlling for the parent at the moment.

02:46.970 --> 02:52.320
This is working with the browser and let's say I'm gonna say zero point five then my lines are going

02:52.320 --> 02:53.270
to be very small.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.280
And that's how the line height would work.

02:55.280 --> 03:00.390
Next up we have the letter spacing so let's write for the paragraph number two.

03:00.400 --> 03:06.500
We're going to be looking for the letter spacing and will be the name and again let's go with pixels

03:06.500 --> 03:07.150
in this case.

03:07.160 --> 03:10.620
But you can use different values and four letter spacing.

03:10.640 --> 03:14.600
We're gonna add a five pixels and what do you think is gonna happen.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.320
I think the name is quite self-explanatory.

03:17.370 --> 03:18.460
The one we're going to save it.

03:18.500 --> 03:24.740
I'm gonna be getting these five pixels in between each and every letter on the actual element that I

03:24.740 --> 03:27.100
have selected so far so good.

03:27.110 --> 03:33.770
We also have the word spacing so let's say for the guy number three we're gonna have the word spacing

03:33.770 --> 03:36.900
property so let's say what is words spacing.

03:37.040 --> 03:40.910
Yeah let's do the same thing 20 pixels should be more than enough.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.660
Now in between each and every word we are getting our 20 pixels.

03:44.660 --> 03:47.400
Again extremely self explanatory.

03:47.570 --> 03:54.770
The two properties with letter spacing and word spacing as well as line height is also very self-explanatory.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.210
Then we have text transform.

03:56.450 --> 03:59.140
So why don't we practice on our heading here.

03:59.140 --> 04:04.790
I'm going to say we're still having one and then we're going to be looking for text transform and in

04:04.790 --> 04:07.890
the text or form we're going to have capitalized.

04:08.010 --> 04:11.390
I'm going to have lowercase and we're going to be looking for uppercase.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.720
So these are the ones that we will going to use most of the time.

04:15.290 --> 04:20.570
So let's say I start with an upper case the whole text is gonna be uppercase and sure enough write down

04:20.570 --> 04:28.520
my headings uppercase I can also do let's say capitalized then the letter of each word is going to first

04:28.520 --> 04:31.100
letter is going to be capitalized just like this.

04:31.100 --> 04:36.590
And then if we want to test that out lowercase Obviously again we're gonna have to go to the body and

04:36.590 --> 04:43.040
let's say for all of them for all the elements I have text transform is gonna be the uppercase and here

04:43.040 --> 04:47.450
for the heading I'm going to change my mind and I'm gonna say I would like to go with the default one

04:47.450 --> 04:48.550
which is lowercase.

04:48.860 --> 04:55.250
But if you're not gonna add anything to the parent element which in our case would be the body then

04:55.400 --> 05:01.130
obviously nothing is gonna happen if you're going to add lowercase because this comes by default as

05:01.130 --> 05:03.350
well as we have text decoration.

05:03.440 --> 05:09.410
Now the easiest way to show you text declaration especially the default one for the length is by looking

05:09.410 --> 05:09.850
at the link.

05:10.550 --> 05:15.180
Ok maybe let's make it a little bit bigger just so I can get my point across.

05:15.200 --> 05:20.240
So in order to select the link I can use the easiest selector that is out there which is an element

05:20.240 --> 05:24.610
selector because you guessed the right link as what.

05:24.860 --> 05:26.790
Well the element is a.

05:26.830 --> 05:33.860
So I'm just selecting the link and let's have the property we already know the font size let's say 40

05:33.860 --> 05:34.520
pixel.

05:34.820 --> 05:36.950
Now I have a massive massive link.

05:37.130 --> 05:43.460
Now one of the things that is kind of annoying about the link here is the fact that it has this underline

05:43.580 --> 05:44.810
by default.

05:44.810 --> 05:49.220
So what you are going to do a lot whenever you're going to be working with he you're going to be looking

05:49.220 --> 05:55.850
for text decoration and in this case we're not going to be looking for colors going to say that we would

05:55.850 --> 06:02.150
want text decoration not so you're gonna get rid of this underline unless you really dig down the line

06:02.800 --> 06:08.090
and let's look at different properties that we have down the line and let's say not for the whole body

06:08.120 --> 06:09.950
but for the heading One.

06:09.980 --> 06:13.880
Let's again go for tax decoration and for tax decoration.

06:13.880 --> 06:19.350
Let's do a line through I'm not going gonna have line Eric through our Eric one.

06:19.490 --> 06:22.610
Also we have the on over line option.

06:22.700 --> 06:28.360
Why don't we test it out on this guy on paragraph number two where we have the line.

06:28.610 --> 06:37.130
I'm sorry that line text tax declaration would be in our case over line and this would go not underline

06:37.220 --> 06:38.940
and not hold delays.

06:39.180 --> 06:45.050
We're going to have over line and sure enough what happens is you see that we have overlap.

06:45.470 --> 06:47.450
Now again it kind of does make sense.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.910
We have multiple lines right.

06:49.280 --> 06:54.800
So you might be thinking well it's kind of like an underline Yeah it is underlined because if you're

06:54.800 --> 07:00.960
looking from this perspective and just to kind of give you an idea we know we can use line height.

07:01.160 --> 07:06.260
So why don't we get really creative and add this line right now for sure.

07:06.320 --> 07:11.690
You must agree with me that this is going to be overlap and last but not least we have the underlying

07:11.960 --> 07:13.520
which again we can use it.

07:13.550 --> 07:18.590
So let's say for this guy we will gonna change and to underline so.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.560
That's right.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.620
Tax uh decoration Yeah.

07:23.030 --> 07:24.010
Not text decoration.

07:24.020 --> 07:24.200
Yeah.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.250
Text decoration.

07:25.280 --> 07:29.370
Uh it was the underlined and sure enough we have it as an underline.

07:29.870 --> 07:37.070
So this is how we can use all these five properties line night layer spacing words spacing text transform

07:37.430 --> 07:39.050
as well as text decoration.
