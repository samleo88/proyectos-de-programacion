00:00.330 --> 00:06.030
Before we deploy our awesome projected in that fire why don't we add more pages because like I talked

00:06.030 --> 00:11.670
before whenever we are gonna be having a finished project we're gonna have multiple pages.

00:11.670 --> 00:16.380
No we're not going to do any kind of coding anymore meaning worlds are going to copy and paste whatever

00:16.380 --> 00:18.530
setup we have in the next session email.

00:18.730 --> 00:22.950
However the moment we're going to click on the skills right now there's obviously no skills actually

00:22.950 --> 00:23.880
on our page.

00:23.880 --> 00:25.830
So in this case we're gonna fix this.

00:25.900 --> 00:30.750
When I had our back to indexation email now we're gonna make this sidebar obviously bigger because we

00:30.750 --> 00:34.410
need to see what we're working with and the setup is gonna be very basic.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.230
So we're gonna say skills.

00:36.390 --> 00:41.730
Now this is gonna be in the name and the name in this case doesn't need to match if you already set

00:41.730 --> 00:42.030
it up.

00:42.030 --> 00:43.320
Here are the links with me.

00:43.440 --> 00:47.940
So make sure that if you had a skills here then also the pages the skills.

00:47.970 --> 00:52.800
And in this case I would like to select everything that I have in the annexation email and then we're

00:52.800 --> 00:56.040
gonna head over back the skills and copy and paste it.

00:56.130 --> 00:59.610
So now we have already some kind of code here maybe let's change this.

00:59.610 --> 01:01.800
Now we don't need the recording anymore.

01:01.980 --> 01:09.320
Can say skills or our skills and say our our skills.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.500
So that's gonna be our page.

01:10.500 --> 01:16.080
We can leave everything here but what I would like to do is to have some kind of little bit of difference.

01:16.140 --> 01:20.530
I will just gonna leave here the skills so everything within the skill section.

01:20.640 --> 01:21.470
Hold a moment.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.690
This is gonna be the end of both skills.

01:23.760 --> 01:29.340
I'm gonna delete everything apart from the closing div here with the footer.

01:29.340 --> 01:34.400
So I'd like to delete all this or meaning you know what I actually went a little bit too far didn't

01:34.400 --> 01:40.620
want to delete the folder so sorry I'm gonna head over back and I would want to delete everything up

01:40.620 --> 01:45.810
to the folder now the folder I don't want to delete because I think that footer we can just leave.

01:45.840 --> 01:52.080
As for all the rest of the pages so let's see this would be the feather and the contact and now I'm

01:52.080 --> 01:53.260
just gonna delete this.

01:53.370 --> 01:56.700
Now the moment we save it again we don't see the skills we can refresh.

01:56.760 --> 02:01.530
This is gonna be my skills now on the skills page again we're just gonna have the header the working

02:01.530 --> 02:05.160
header but then we're gonna have footer again very simple.

02:05.160 --> 02:09.430
Now in this case we're gonna select the skills we all gonna create a new one.

02:09.510 --> 02:14.600
Now the other one was what we see with missing indexation amount.

02:15.460 --> 02:19.210
It was about page so let's call this about.

02:19.220 --> 02:23.540
We're going to copy and paste it at this point we can again change the name.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.080
Uh about us let's say about um about us.

02:28.110 --> 02:35.600
That's gonna be then title the page then in this case we do want to get rid of the skills because skills

02:35.620 --> 02:41.030
is only for a skills section and then we're going to be looking we're still gonna can keep the content

02:41.030 --> 02:44.870
divider let's say skills section is gonna be gone.

02:44.870 --> 02:49.410
So we're gonna write something like this then this is gonna be my div.

02:49.540 --> 02:51.680
Obviously this is gonna work out or you know what.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.410
Again I went too far.

02:54.230 --> 02:58.870
May make the footer a little bit smaller otherwise I don't see anything.

02:58.970 --> 02:59.350
Again.

02:59.360 --> 03:05.430
Let's see where the skills let's select the skills let's see where's the footer.

03:05.590 --> 03:06.760
We can delete it.

03:06.940 --> 03:12.250
Now we're gonna head over back to indexation UML and I would just like to select the about one I got

03:12.250 --> 03:17.560
normally would you do you would add more content but since I think that we already have worked hard

03:17.560 --> 03:23.020
on this project what I can do is we can just cheat a little bit and add whatever items we have only

03:23.020 --> 03:29.170
in the end but not this is gonna be the end of about so I can just copy and paste it and place it here.

03:29.170 --> 03:35.500
In between the content divider and after that once we're gonna save it notice and we're gonna have my

03:35.590 --> 03:38.540
number and within that bar I click on about.

03:38.710 --> 03:43.420
And again here I'm gonna have my about section you already should know what we're going to be doing

03:43.420 --> 03:44.590
with the product.

03:44.770 --> 03:54.670
So there's gonna be a new file for some reason I'm gonna type it created again new file name products

03:55.480 --> 04:02.150
HDMI all and then we can either use the skills or we can use the amount and doesn't really matter.

04:02.350 --> 04:05.210
I'm gonna select about again we're going to copy and paste it.

04:05.380 --> 04:07.690
The name is gonna be different.

04:07.920 --> 04:16.660
We're gonna name this our product and then we will gonna get rid of the about some voters are not going

04:16.650 --> 04:23.370
to be necessary to make sure that this time I don't delete the footer or at least attempt to delete

04:23.370 --> 04:24.290
the footer.

04:24.390 --> 04:25.330
And you know what.

04:25.410 --> 04:28.360
Within the indexation email we have right away the product.

04:28.980 --> 04:34.210
So why don't we select the product single product single product area.

04:34.640 --> 04:40.100
I'm going to copy and paste this guy and within the product we're gonna copy and paste the product and

04:40.110 --> 04:46.200
this way I can head over back to a larger browser window and we should have everything set up with the

04:46.200 --> 04:50.520
pages as well as the SS and JavaScript so I'm going to close everything here.

04:50.520 --> 04:56.490
Hopefully everything is working this is gonna be my mighty station now maybe make this hundred percent

04:57.050 --> 05:06.330
I want home to be my home if I want the skills and have the skills and I think everything is gonna be

05:06.330 --> 05:07.690
fine What's that about.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.340
And last but not least we also have the product.

05:10.530 --> 05:11.890
And congrats guys.

05:11.910 --> 05:18.600
We finished this amazing project with just the assessed world by the way which is a big accomplishment.

05:18.670 --> 05:21.620
And now let's head over and notify.

05:21.620 --> 05:23.090
Who's gonna do the rest of the job.

05:23.220 --> 05:25.450
Because we would like to deploy it on Butterfly.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.400
So the whole world can see our site.
