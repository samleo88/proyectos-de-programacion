Hopefully you understand the general idea behind inheritance.

00:03.930 --> 00:08.220
Now let's look at some caveats to the inherit no in order to do that.

00:08.220 --> 00:14.220
We're gonna head over back to the style assess and we're gonna have a selection for the body and for

00:14.220 --> 00:17.220
the body would like to have some kind of fun family.

00:17.220 --> 00:22.440
Now I know I keep repeating this but please don't focus on the properties and the values because we

00:22.440 --> 00:29.620
will gonna cover them in general I would have to cover some very major topics first and then we're going

00:29.620 --> 00:31.770
to look at the specific properties and the value.

00:32.310 --> 00:36.750
Now like I said we're going to be looking for the family and in our case we're gonna go forward the

00:36.770 --> 00:43.110
model space and we're also gonna add some line height let's say line height is gonna be one point five

00:43.460 --> 00:45.450
OEM's or something like that.

00:45.570 --> 00:47.390
So notice something interesting.

00:47.430 --> 00:52.560
Now all my children element are inheriting this from the body.

00:52.590 --> 00:59.940
Now the reason for that is not only we are just using some kind of assets we are not overwriting this

00:59.940 --> 01:01.320
specific property.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.640
So this is important.

01:02.760 --> 01:08.550
Now let's say again we're going to add the color of red within the body then because we are selecting

01:08.550 --> 01:12.330
this color within the div as well as within the heading to.

01:12.520 --> 01:18.450
This is where we are more specifically working with this element or if there is gonna be properties

01:18.450 --> 01:21.120
that we're passing down from the parent.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.470
We will get the inherited.

01:23.010 --> 01:29.490
So this is kind of important point because understand that this will be inherited unless you specifically

01:29.730 --> 01:31.980
overwrite that specific property.

01:32.370 --> 01:37.680
So please don't get confused and don't think that just because you added color blue in a div doesn't

01:37.680 --> 01:41.400
mean that you are going to also overwrite the font family in line break.

01:41.550 --> 01:42.710
It doesn't work that way.

01:42.750 --> 01:45.170
It needs to be a specific property.

01:45.240 --> 01:50.790
Now in that case I was all going to be using different value like with heading to where you have the

01:50.790 --> 01:56.700
same property with different value but if you are not working with that property then you will gonna

01:56.700 --> 01:58.680
be inheriting that property.

01:58.680 --> 02:03.090
Now what's also important is that not every properties are going to be inherited.

02:03.630 --> 02:08.610
So let's say we're going to work with a border and in this case we're going to add like three pixels

02:09.030 --> 02:11.210
solid and I don't know black.

02:11.220 --> 02:12.480
Something like this.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.920
Check this out only Dave right now has this property.

02:16.110 --> 02:19.830
So not all the properties can be inherited by children.

02:19.830 --> 02:21.570
So that's also something to remember.
