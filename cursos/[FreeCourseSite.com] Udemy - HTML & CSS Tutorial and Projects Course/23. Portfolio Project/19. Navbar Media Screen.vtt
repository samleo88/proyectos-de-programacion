WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:06.600
In order to actually change the lay out with a screen says we need to create a media where are you going

00:06.600 --> 00:14.880
to say media screen here and I'm going to say and I know this is going to be mine with all here.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.360
And for the men with we would want 768.

00:19.500 --> 00:26.370
So we're going to say 768 pixels here first what I would want is I would want to start working with

00:26.370 --> 00:27.050
an app.

00:27.210 --> 00:31.750
So I'm going to say we are now have and like I said since we're here now.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.080
Now is this played like this.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.660
So you can see that we have one element and the second one.

00:37.800 --> 00:44.430
Now I would want a display flex so I'm going this display and we're going to say flex and now in this

00:44.510 --> 00:49.260
video we're going to be switching back and forth a lot because I think this is going to be probably

00:49.260 --> 00:52.350
the most complicated section actually.

00:52.350 --> 00:55.180
So once I say it you can say this is what I have.

00:55.350 --> 01:00.940
So I have a few things going on right now they're actually sitting all side by side like this.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.870
So this is obviously not something that we want.

01:03.870 --> 01:10.650
So first I don't want to get rid of this mortar here here for the header and also want to get rid of

01:10.650 --> 01:11.650
this button.

01:11.670 --> 01:17.080
So I'm going to go back over here and if I'm just going to say we're here like this then I want a nav

01:17.890 --> 01:19.660
header here.

01:19.690 --> 01:24.130
I don't know we're going to save water and we're none on here like this.

01:24.180 --> 01:31.670
And also what I would want is a nav between and display of none like this.

01:31.700 --> 01:37.530
So if I'm going to go back over here and if I am saved if this is what we have now honestly this is

01:37.530 --> 01:40.190
not going to be working great either.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.220
We do actually have a few things.

01:42.370 --> 01:48.870
So the first one is actually going to be a border bottom and then we're going to do a flex ramp once

01:48.870 --> 01:51.360
we're actually wrapping the elements.

01:51.360 --> 01:58.800
So we're going to go back over here and we're going to see if we're to have want a flex and it's a wrap

01:58.950 --> 02:07.710
and we're going to be wrapping then also what I would want is a border bottom border bottom and for

02:07.710 --> 02:14.110
the border bottom we're going to have 0.5 RPMs solid and voire.

02:14.340 --> 02:15.610
And this is going to be dark.

02:15.780 --> 02:18.630
So pretty much the color we already used before.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.540
So we're going to go back over here.

02:20.790 --> 02:29.490
Now I actually should have my car now once we actually have the border and we got rid of the button.

02:29.490 --> 02:31.970
Now we will want to work with the next.

02:32.070 --> 02:35.480
So we're going to go back over here and we're going to stay like this.

02:35.480 --> 02:44.120
So first one out one for now links and have links and for the links we would want first a background.

02:44.230 --> 02:46.500
And we're going to say we're here background transparent.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.650
So we want them transparent.

02:48.660 --> 02:57.380
However remember when we set the height of 0 0 0 here and only the bottom could change it to 88.

02:57.450 --> 03:04.010
Now with a bigger screen let's do it like this let's say height and let's put it to auto on here.

03:04.260 --> 03:09.130
So once I say it you can see right now all of them are showing right away.

03:09.510 --> 03:19.020
So next what I would want is I would want to set this UL so on or list as a flex burn and actually display

03:19.020 --> 03:20.360
them flex like this.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.410
Because right now we have the flex box.

03:22.410 --> 03:27.400
However we will want to display the actual child and created the parent.

03:27.480 --> 03:30.380
So as you can see or hear these are the properties.

03:30.420 --> 03:36.530
As a child because again this is going to be the child of Nav. of parent of the flags box.

03:36.540 --> 03:40.520
However we can also set the properties as a parent.

03:40.620 --> 03:44.340
So we're going to say we're here then we would want to set it as a parent.

03:44.340 --> 03:50.900
Now the last one as a child what we would want is a flex here 1 0.

03:51.180 --> 03:57.590
So grow as much as you have to shrink don't shrink and the base is going to be auto.

03:57.600 --> 04:04.650
So what I'm saying here is since I know that I'm going to be setting them has a flex neuro how one does

04:05.160 --> 04:09.170
actual logo to take as little space as possible.

04:09.170 --> 04:14.320
So that's what I'm seeing or hear stickle here and the actual nav links is going to take the rest of

04:14.320 --> 04:15.280
the space.

04:15.330 --> 04:23.760
So I'm going to go back here and I'm going to say that now as a parent as a parent parent now what we

04:23.760 --> 04:25.430
would want as a parent.

04:25.620 --> 04:29.970
Now we're going to say first that we would want is this play flex.

04:30.210 --> 04:34.950
So check it out and we have Sure enough now I can see that I have my looks.

04:35.500 --> 04:40.530
Now also I would want is a flex up so I would be able to wrapping.

04:40.540 --> 04:47.590
So Flex wrap and wrap so if there's not going to be enough screen size we're going to be wrapping we're

04:47.610 --> 04:52.360
going to do just content space around them is going to be another one.

04:52.380 --> 04:58.010
Now I also want to line them up with an image see or hear the actual logo is better.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.930
And the links on top.

05:00.120 --> 05:03.050
So I'm going to say we're here on line self.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.280
We're going to do a center here.

05:05.520 --> 05:11.270
So once I serve it sure enough now I can see my links are in actually the center.

05:11.460 --> 05:17.890
And also what I would want is to work more here with this hovering and in general with these links.

05:17.900 --> 05:18.590
All right.

05:18.860 --> 05:22.510
So may go back here and let's say we're here like this.

05:22.560 --> 05:27.060
Now I have saying no I don't we're going to call this link.

05:27.060 --> 05:33.680
Now what I would want for the single link first I would want background transparent like this.

05:33.780 --> 05:40.640
Then I would want flex since these are children right now for on a list and I'm going to say one so

05:40.650 --> 05:42.860
grow as much as you have to.

05:43.020 --> 05:44.720
Don't shrink zero.

05:44.890 --> 05:47.890
We're going to set it a 100 pixels on here.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.550
So again we're a service here this is what we're.

05:51.810 --> 05:58.320
Now let's get rid of all this padding because as you can see or hear this doesn't look very good if

05:58.320 --> 06:03.390
it's actually going left and right now I mean if you want to you can actually keep it here this is what

06:03.390 --> 06:05.580
you like but I'm just going to get rid of it.

06:05.580 --> 06:06.950
So here I'm going to say I like this.

06:06.950 --> 06:13.910
We're going to say more have and link over here a single link and however.

06:14.010 --> 06:17.900
So what should happen as we're hovering padding or here left.

06:17.940 --> 06:23.820
And remember when we had the padding we set the padding for one left and right.

06:23.850 --> 06:27.740
So we're going to do all here would you say padding left is also going to be one.

06:27.900 --> 06:32.870
So basically it's not changing color and the color let's change the color to voire.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.340
And I know we're going to say dark really this.

06:36.390 --> 06:38.650
So let me just say this.

06:38.700 --> 06:43.320
And as you can see as I'm hovering the color is going to be changing and dark but there's not going

06:43.320 --> 06:44.540
to be any movement.

06:44.580 --> 06:49.480
So this is how we can actually change and have more in our flex box project.

06:49.550 --> 06:53.670
And as you can see or hear it doesn't have enough space.

06:53.730 --> 07:00.430
So actually since the knife is a flex box pen you can see that it's wrapping on a new line or where

07:00.480 --> 07:04.160
once it gets to the small screen now you can just click the button.

07:04.260 --> 07:06.380
And now we have our Lynx ready to go.
