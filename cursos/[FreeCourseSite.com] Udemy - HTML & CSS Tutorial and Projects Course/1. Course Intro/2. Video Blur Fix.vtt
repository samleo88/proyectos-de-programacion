Hey guys.

00:01.120 --> 00:05.470
As you were watching the course you might experience these two following issues.

00:05.470 --> 00:12.050
The video quality goes bananas and the transcript does not match exactly what I'm saying in the video.

00:12.070 --> 00:17.740
Please be aware that both of these issues have nothing to do with this specific course or how the course

00:17.740 --> 00:23.500
was recorded meaning you might experience the same issues in different courses as well.

00:23.530 --> 00:29.620
So the first issue you might encounter could be a bad video quality where as you were watching the course

00:29.950 --> 00:35.350
screen might go blur and it will be very very hard to read anything off the screen.

00:35.440 --> 00:39.750
Well I don't want to bore you with details of what causes that particular issue.

00:39.770 --> 00:42.250
Short answer would be auto resolution.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.780
The fix is very simple.

00:43.780 --> 00:47.920
Just click on the settings cog and choose 720.

00:48.220 --> 00:54.610
If your internet connection is slow you might need to go for even lower resolution but in most cases

00:54.610 --> 00:57.240
720 will do the job.

00:57.250 --> 01:02.570
So imagine you're watching the course and all of a sudden the video quality gets bad.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.140
Just head over to a cog icon.

01:05.140 --> 01:08.020
Click on it and pick 720 AP.

01:08.260 --> 01:12.690
If your internet connection is slow you might need to go for lower resolution.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.390
But in most cases 720 will do the job.

01:16.390 --> 01:20.050
Now the second issue you might encounter is transcript being off.

01:20.050 --> 01:25.720
Meaning if you're watching the course with subtitles on and the text does not match exactly what I'm

01:25.720 --> 01:26.920
saying in the video.

01:27.130 --> 01:33.730
Again instructors have no control over it and unfortunately at this point in time I cannot provide you

01:33.730 --> 01:37.050
with any possible fix for this particular issue.
