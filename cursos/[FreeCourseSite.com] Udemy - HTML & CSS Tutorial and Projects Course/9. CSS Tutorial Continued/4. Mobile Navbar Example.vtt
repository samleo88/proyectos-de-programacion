WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:07.110
We also need to cover the fact that browser does respect top bottom margin and padding for block elements

00:07.560 --> 00:10.310
but does not respect it for inline elements.

00:10.830 --> 00:15.900
And in order to hit this home we'll make a simple mobile number in the process.

00:15.900 --> 00:21.390
We're also gonna cover less style type property and the selectors in CSI.

00:21.870 --> 00:23.460
Let's start with an easy one.

00:23.580 --> 00:26.690
The block level elements or the block element.

00:26.700 --> 00:31.070
So for this I'm just going to get rid of everything that we have right now in a C assess.

00:31.140 --> 00:33.270
I'm gonna head over to the next page the email.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.950
Later on we're gonna change it.

00:34.950 --> 00:40.020
We're going to add obviously some different elements here but for now I just want to show that if I

00:40.020 --> 00:44.160
have let's say div 95 I'm gonna go here and see Asus.

00:44.310 --> 00:45.350
We already covered this.

00:45.350 --> 00:51.980
That if I'm going to add the background and say background on blue collar or white and if I'm going

00:51.980 --> 00:59.010
to add let's do the easy one padding all around is going to be 20 pixels and margin all around is also

00:59.010 --> 01:00.430
gonna be 20 pixels.

01:00.450 --> 01:01.300
Now what's going to happen.

01:01.770 --> 01:06.450
Well margin is going to be respected as well as the padding is gonna be in respect.

01:06.510 --> 01:10.550
Now it's gonna make a little bit more sense once we're gonna work with the inline ones because you'll

01:10.560 --> 01:14.880
see what happens with these elements and why they differ.

01:14.940 --> 01:18.340
Now in this case maybe we can get rid of dave AGAIN.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.590
ALL GONNA SAVE THE C assess.

01:20.870 --> 01:25.260
We all gonna delete it in nature CML and let's create our neighbor.

01:25.300 --> 01:31.500
Now no we're gonna use these on our list then we know that within the on our list we have a list element

01:32.100 --> 01:34.720
and within the list element let's place a link.

01:34.890 --> 01:38.990
Now for the link we're gonna place hash tags since this link is not going to go anywhere.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.390
And then I just gonna write home.

01:40.620 --> 01:42.330
So this is gonna be our first link.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.830
Now let me maybe make three more.

01:45.130 --> 01:49.440
And I was gonna change the values here so first and foremost I'm gonna select few of them I'm gonna

01:49.470 --> 01:51.820
delete them all of them at the same time.

01:51.990 --> 01:53.270
Then we're gonna add I don't know.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.310
This is gonna be about us page.

01:55.590 --> 01:57.620
And we're also gonna have the link to.

01:57.630 --> 02:05.370
I don't know products page and last but not least we have the link to contact us page so for pages so

02:05.370 --> 02:06.350
far so good.

02:06.420 --> 02:11.730
Once the HMO has been set up we're gonna head over back to Stiles is this and we're gonna do our styling

02:12.200 --> 02:12.650
now.

02:12.750 --> 02:18.840
First we need to understand that for now we're having these margins here that are coming by default

02:18.840 --> 02:20.040
from the browser.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.410
So we'd like to get rid of them.

02:21.480 --> 02:26.590
And remember we have an option of changing or selecting sorry all the elements.

02:26.700 --> 02:31.060
And now we already have covered these two properties where I'm just gonna add the margin.

02:31.380 --> 02:37.320
So margin right away by default at the moment is gonna be zero for all of them as well as we're gonna

02:37.350 --> 02:42.660
get rid of the padding and then there's gonna be properties that we're gonna cover in a few videos which

02:42.660 --> 02:47.730
is gonna be box sizing and we're gonna write back sizing and in this case we're going to write motorbikes

02:47.990 --> 02:48.560
again.

02:48.780 --> 02:53.280
I'm not going to cover this right now we're gonna cover it in a separate video because it's gonna make

02:53.280 --> 02:55.680
a little bit more sense so far so good.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.870
So we have right now the margin is zero.

02:57.870 --> 03:00.760
The padding is zero as well as the box sizing.

03:00.870 --> 03:04.250
So now we're having actually a far different view right now.

03:04.320 --> 03:08.300
So we got from the we got away from all the default styles.

03:09.030 --> 03:09.570
Okay.

03:09.660 --> 03:10.590
What's next.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.720
Well let's maybe add some fun family.

03:12.720 --> 03:19.850
We know that we can add it for a whole body it was great fun family is gonna be let's go with Madonna

03:20.180 --> 03:25.740
and we already know that this is gonna give us the fun snack and the last one is gonna be Eric sans

03:25.740 --> 03:31.710
serif and obviously we see right away that the fans have been successfully changed now since I want

03:31.710 --> 03:34.830
to show you the property of list style type.

03:34.830 --> 03:36.510
Let me just comment this out for now.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.780
No you don't have to do this on your end.

03:38.850 --> 03:43.400
I'm just gonna do it all here just so you can see what this property is doing because otherwise it's

03:43.410 --> 03:50.250
gonna be like well I'm sure that he's doing it correctly because nothing is changing also in the CSF

03:50.280 --> 03:53.590
we can select the children now in our case what's happening.

03:53.760 --> 04:00.260
So we have on our list correct then we have a list item which is the child of the on our list and there

04:00.260 --> 04:06.040
is actually four children and then each and every list item has the child of the link.

04:06.090 --> 04:07.570
So how we can select them.

04:07.860 --> 04:10.680
Well we have an option here of going on our list.

04:10.800 --> 04:16.590
So we're selecting on our list and then we're saying all the list items that are children off on our

04:16.590 --> 04:22.950
list we would like to select them now for them we would like to select the property of list style list

04:22.950 --> 04:27.220
style because this is obviously a list and then we have list style type.

04:27.270 --> 04:33.330
Now we have many options here again we have our mania in circle whatever disk maybe we can check it

04:33.330 --> 04:39.990
out this code works and yeah it doesn't really change anything let me see another one square me square

04:39.990 --> 04:43.650
is gonna be different now you can see that there is gonna be square.

04:43.650 --> 04:50.400
Let me try one more last one that I want to spend the whole day on them we have up a room one we have

04:50.530 --> 04:53.690
alpha let's try this maybe f or Roman.

04:53.790 --> 04:59.220
So now I have Roman numerals but mostly what you're always gonna do with the list you're gonna write

04:59.220 --> 05:04.510
some like this you're gonna say I don't want these dots I just want them clear because you will use

05:04.510 --> 05:06.980
these lists for your navigation.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.320
So in this case you're gonna be setting this up and you're gonna say a list out of none.

05:11.320 --> 05:17.680
So once we have successfully added this property list style type with a value none now we can head over

05:17.770 --> 05:19.520
or I can head over I don't know.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.410
Did you uncommon this or not.

05:21.460 --> 05:23.740
And now I'm going to uncommon this again.

05:23.740 --> 05:29.860
And now we can place it again without any default margins pairings as well as set the box sizing to

05:29.860 --> 05:31.220
the bar box.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.400
And now let's work with our links and again we can do the same thing.

05:34.450 --> 05:36.540
We have the on our list correct.

05:36.730 --> 05:38.910
Then within our list we have what.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.740
Well we have these links.

05:40.810 --> 05:46.360
Now I can do this directly I can just say all the links that are gonna be within the one on our list

05:46.810 --> 05:52.840
or we can be more precise I can say here that if there is going to be let's say for example some other

05:53.260 --> 06:00.130
link elements directly here as the children maybe it would be a little bit more precise to use this

06:00.240 --> 06:01.650
ally in our case.

06:01.660 --> 06:03.430
This is not going to make any difference.

06:03.430 --> 06:08.180
It will only make a difference if you're going to have some link elements without these list items here.

06:08.290 --> 06:13.280
That would be the case where if you want to select only those ones you'd like to use this ally.

06:13.510 --> 06:16.100
But in our case either of them would work.

06:16.210 --> 06:23.110
We can either do you well lie and then the link or you can just say well so on our list and then we're

06:23.110 --> 06:28.080
looking for the link please understand what we're going to do with the links won't let us decide.

06:28.090 --> 06:31.360
We know already that we have the tax declaration.

06:31.360 --> 06:36.220
So let me get rid of the tax declaration and I was gonna say none so far so good.

06:36.220 --> 06:42.220
Then also we know the property tax transform and for the tax transform value we're gonna use capitalized.

06:42.220 --> 06:47.860
So now while our tax is going to be capitalized also let's add some letter spacing let's say for the

06:47.860 --> 06:51.590
spacing we're going to have two pixels so far so good.

06:51.700 --> 06:52.930
And we have two pixels.

06:52.930 --> 06:55.300
Also maybe let's add some background.

06:55.450 --> 06:58.810
Let's say that the background is gonna be hashtag 2 2 2.

06:58.810 --> 07:07.020
So the background is going to be black and the color is gonna be let's say are orange f 1 5 0 2 4.

07:07.570 --> 07:08.790
So so far so good.

07:08.830 --> 07:10.410
Everything is working out.

07:10.490 --> 07:17.310
However what if I would like to make sure of f 1 5 0 2 0 0 2 5.

07:17.410 --> 07:19.630
Hopefully this is gonna be the orange one.

07:19.660 --> 07:26.410
Now the key here is I would like to add some paring here top and bottom for my element as well as maybe

07:26.410 --> 07:31.270
a little bit of margin in between now eventually once we set up everything we're not gonna have any

07:31.270 --> 07:35.800
margin but just to prove we point let's say that I would want both.

07:35.800 --> 07:41.010
I would want some padding tomorrow as well as I would want some margin to ban him.

07:41.170 --> 07:41.470
Okay.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.370
Let's try it out.

07:42.730 --> 07:48.280
Let's say first of all pairing is gonna be all around and we're just gonna say patting is gonna be five

07:48.280 --> 07:49.550
pixels.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.660
Okay already something interesting is happening.

07:52.900 --> 07:58.100
I'm having the padding but they are overlaying one on top of each other.

07:58.210 --> 08:00.720
That's definitely not the look that I want.

08:00.730 --> 08:06.730
No okay we're gonna keep on moving and I'm going to say margin is also gonna be top bottom and something

08:06.730 --> 08:07.650
left and right.

08:07.690 --> 08:12.700
However maybe since you don't believe me would be like Well okay you're just writing it incorrect.

08:12.790 --> 08:13.800
Let me try a different way.

08:13.810 --> 08:19.810
Let's say top bottom is gonna be 10 pixels as well as 10 pixels is gonna be left and right now what

08:19.810 --> 08:20.620
happens.

08:20.710 --> 08:25.600
The links are moving left and right and obviously in this case we just see the left side because there

08:25.600 --> 08:30.910
is nothing here on the right hand side but they're not moving top and bottom so what's happening.

08:30.970 --> 08:37.810
Well remember links were in line they were inline elements and what happens is that browser is not gonna

08:37.870 --> 08:43.830
respect that as you start adding these patterns here as well as the margins for the top bottom.

08:44.380 --> 08:50.090
So in our case in order to fix this we would need to make them as the block level element.

08:50.170 --> 08:51.010
So how do we do that.

08:51.430 --> 08:52.980
Well first of all let me get rid of this.

08:53.050 --> 08:55.320
Let's say that I would like to get a margin padding.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.080
We're just gonna really write this.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.350
And in this case I'm going to say this play.

08:59.350 --> 09:04.560
And now instead of in line which was the original one the default one I'm going to say display block.

09:04.960 --> 09:05.880
So check this out.

09:06.150 --> 09:11.620
So now my links are all the way from one side to another side of the screen.

09:11.620 --> 09:17.340
And now if we're gonna start adding padding and let's say for us the padding is gonna be top bottom

09:17.340 --> 09:21.640
is going to be let's say 10 pixels and then left and right is gonna be 10 pixels.

09:21.640 --> 09:25.930
Now obviously again the padding is gonna be only shown on the left hand side because there's plenty

09:25.930 --> 09:27.120
of space right here.

09:27.190 --> 09:33.970
So I'm not going to be able to see what happens right now my links are actually respecting this padding

09:33.970 --> 09:34.780
top bottom.

09:34.780 --> 09:38.040
The browser is respecting because their block element.

09:38.170 --> 09:43.210
Now the same thing if we would want to do this but again we are not technically wouldn't want to do

09:43.210 --> 09:45.440
it in the mobile menu.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.350
But I mean maybe who knows.

09:47.470 --> 09:52.720
But you could add the margin so let's say I could do just the marginal around in this case and now these

09:52.720 --> 09:58.600
10 pixels of margin of left and right are going to be respected not just the left and right just like

09:58.600 --> 10:01.310
we had previously but again in this case probably.

10:01.310 --> 10:03.260
This is not something that we're going to use.

10:03.410 --> 10:09.650
But again just to show you the four block elements the browsers will going to respect the top bottom

10:09.980 --> 10:11.270
beheading and margin.

10:11.270 --> 10:18.620
However for the inline elements they are not going to respect the top and bottom margin and padding.
