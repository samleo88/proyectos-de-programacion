WEBVTT

00:00.520 --> 00:05.280
Just to give you a taste of what we're going to be doing in the project why don't we make a three column

00:05.280 --> 00:07.990
layout with devs and with.

00:08.570 --> 00:10.250
Now an index and HDMI.

00:10.260 --> 00:14.190
We're going to create first of all we're gonna get her of this closing dear.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.960
I don't want that.

00:16.040 --> 00:16.650
And you know what.

00:16.650 --> 00:21.750
Let me make this a little bit smaller for now and let's write that there's gonna be a Dave.

00:21.780 --> 00:28.100
Now Dave is gonna have some kind of class so I'm gonna say class of one and maybe we can add some texture.

00:28.110 --> 00:29.270
I don't know 10 words.

00:29.460 --> 00:30.820
This is gonna be good enough.

00:30.900 --> 00:35.510
Now I'm gonna copy and paste this two more times and I'm gonna change these class names.

00:35.520 --> 00:38.000
I'm going to say this is not gonna be number one.

00:38.070 --> 00:45.310
Instead we're gonna be looking for number two that's gonna be my name and the third one is gonna be

00:45.310 --> 00:46.190
number three.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.250
Again very very original.

00:48.250 --> 00:54.550
I'm gonna head over back to my C assess and just because this is a little bit annoying to me the default

00:54.550 --> 00:59.910
ones that come with because I would like to show you how the three column layout is gonna come up I'm

00:59.910 --> 01:06.110
going to do a reset again where I'm just gonna say margin is gonna be equal to zero.

01:06.110 --> 01:14.740
Adding is gonna be equal again to zero and border box is gonna be equal to a box sizing voter but I'm

01:14.740 --> 01:21.310
sorry it was box sizing box it's not shadow I haven't covered I have one air and water box.

01:21.300 --> 01:26.680
Again it might be an overkill in general for small examples that we're doing but I just like to show

01:26.680 --> 01:32.140
you a correct three column layout and otherwise it's not gonna good look good as good as I want.

01:32.690 --> 01:36.730
OK so let's start with the class number one let's say that for the class number one.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.570
Well first of all graph loaded to the left.

01:39.640 --> 01:45.640
Now again we notice 13 something is happening because our layout changed but I think it's gonna be easier

01:45.640 --> 01:46.450
to show you.

01:46.450 --> 01:52.090
Background on background attachment is something we covered but I don't want it to say background is

01:52.090 --> 01:52.990
gonna be red.

01:53.230 --> 01:54.860
And what else I would want.

01:54.860 --> 01:59.510
Well maybe let's add some height of I don't know 200 pixels.

01:59.650 --> 02:01.120
Well that's gonna be my first thing.

02:01.250 --> 02:04.750
And now let's add some width so I already have floated to the left.

02:05.110 --> 02:11.210
And since that 1 3 column layout since I have three days I'm gonna sit with with percentage.

02:11.230 --> 02:17.620
Now you don't have to do this as 3 three if you have four layers then use for 25 percent if five divs

02:17.920 --> 02:20.070
20 percent and so on and so forth.

02:20.100 --> 02:23.110
There's no rule that you have to use this kind of percentages.

02:23.110 --> 02:28.760
The only reason why I'm doing this because I have three column layout so I know that I need to divide

02:28.770 --> 02:32.500
hundred percent by three and this is gonna be the closest one that I want.

02:33.030 --> 02:33.780
Okay.

02:33.880 --> 02:34.570
What else I have.

02:34.570 --> 02:38.250
Well I believe I had the div number two.

02:38.380 --> 02:39.620
So I'm going to say here.

02:39.640 --> 02:44.790
Class was number two and obviously we can head it over here and say for the day of all of them are going

02:44.790 --> 02:50.080
to be floated to the left I am copying pasting a little bit too much meaning I'm repeating the same

02:50.080 --> 02:52.860
things but just so we are on the same page.

02:52.870 --> 02:54.480
Let's work one by one.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.970
And here again we're going to say the same thing.

02:56.980 --> 02:58.750
So this is gonna be my second one.

02:59.140 --> 03:04.150
And you already have guessed that that if I would one the third one I would again need to do something

03:04.150 --> 03:10.630
like this where this is gonna be number three and let's do this one as a green one.

03:10.870 --> 03:12.130
Let me delete this.

03:12.130 --> 03:15.950
This is gonna be number three and then we're gonna use the green.

03:15.970 --> 03:20.770
So this is gonna be something we're going to be doing in a project we're gonna be doing whole but more

03:20.770 --> 03:26.920
sophisticated not with red blue and green and all that but the general idea would be that if you want

03:26.920 --> 03:33.160
some kind of column layout we're gonna be using the floating loft and just tell you that why this was

03:33.280 --> 03:39.250
technically incorrect because I was repeating the actual properties with values I didn't have to do

03:39.250 --> 03:44.320
that since all of them is gonna have the let's say height here with two hundred pixels I could have

03:44.320 --> 03:45.950
just done something like this.

03:46.150 --> 03:49.930
So I'm gonna cut this out and I'm gonna also cut it out.

03:49.930 --> 03:55.530
These guys let's say like this now I'm floating all of them.

03:55.670 --> 04:01.100
So all the divs Now obviously if you're gonna be adding more divs This isn't gonna mess up but since

04:01.100 --> 04:02.770
in our case we just have three days.

04:02.810 --> 04:08.020
I can just use this element selector and then what else we can do well we can get rid of all of them

04:08.630 --> 04:14.750
so I can just say here that for each one of them the only that I would be interested is in fact the

04:14.750 --> 04:15.510
background.

04:15.590 --> 04:16.840
Now that way again.

04:17.030 --> 04:18.810
Notice when the moment I'm saved.

04:18.980 --> 04:20.740
Nothing changes everything.

04:20.750 --> 04:21.890
Nothing breaks.

04:21.890 --> 04:23.770
I still have my three column layer.

04:24.020 --> 04:30.560
Now the reason for that is because I know I have all the divs so I had it for all of them left and then

04:30.650 --> 04:31.820
some type of height.

04:31.820 --> 04:37.090
Now you're not limited I can just say something like this here and just say that the height is gonna

04:37.100 --> 04:41.430
be I don't know 400 so I'm still gonna have the 400 height.

04:41.660 --> 04:43.740
Now my columns are going to be bigger.

04:43.910 --> 04:50.840
And regardless of the screen size I'm still gonna have three column layout I do want to mention though

04:51.080 --> 04:53.310
that we do need to work with clear.

04:53.420 --> 05:01.430
So in my case what if I'm going to say having one with a simple Hello World I save it okay.

05:01.440 --> 05:02.940
Everything is looking fine.

05:03.060 --> 05:09.540
So technically we have cleared the ship and we have three column layout and we do have all here right

05:09.540 --> 05:16.200
now we're having one but we know that if we're gonna go and let's say I had one more dev and this is

05:16.200 --> 05:18.790
not gonna be the layout we're looking for.

05:18.930 --> 05:25.530
So we're gonna go here and now having one is gonna be sitting actually side by side because again we

05:25.530 --> 05:28.190
do have the property for the clearing there.

05:28.680 --> 05:35.250
So in my case I would want to take adding one and you're gonna have the clear and the option would be

05:35.340 --> 05:37.880
I guess the best case scenario would be.

05:38.130 --> 05:42.770
Now I know in this case this might look like a unnecessary example.

05:42.930 --> 05:48.300
You could say well having one was still fine order and then there's gonna be cases if you're using with

05:48.300 --> 05:53.640
floats and by the way I want to let you know that in most cases you're going to use at this point already

05:53.640 --> 05:54.360
probably flags.

05:54.370 --> 05:59.760
But I do want to cover floats though and we will going to do the project when the float because I think

05:59.760 --> 06:06.210
it's important for you to know the float but whenever you're using the float you do need to start practicing

06:06.210 --> 06:11.760
of the fact that whenever is gonna be coming after something that you're floating you're adding this

06:11.760 --> 06:13.000
clear property.

06:13.140 --> 06:17.550
Otherwise there's gonna be cases where you're looking for mistakes and it's really hard to find and

06:17.550 --> 06:22.010
that's why this is the easiest way where you right away use the clear property.

06:22.020 --> 06:23.940
And again you can set it to left.

06:23.940 --> 06:30.240
You can set it whatever direction you want but where you can use the both which in that case at least

06:30.240 --> 06:34.550
you're making sure that whatever direction you're floating this is going to be fine.

06:34.620 --> 06:40.950
But I would suggest using the property right away just in case you don't run into some kind of mistakes

06:40.950 --> 06:41.400
later on.
