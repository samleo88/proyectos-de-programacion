00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,300
Hey guys, welcome back. I'm going to style

2

00:00:02,310  -->  00:00:04,309
the app up a little bit to make it look

3

00:00:04,319  -->  00:00:06,470
less basic and simple for the rest of

4

00:00:06,480  -->  00:00:09,200
this section of videos, but before I do that

5

00:00:09,210  -->  00:00:11,390
I want to allow you guys to do the same,

6

00:00:11,400  -->  00:00:13,490
so I'm own going to explain the concept of

7

00:00:13,500  -->  00:00:17,630
static files in Django. So with Django as you

8

00:00:17,640  -->  00:00:19,279
can see most of the files we've created

9

00:00:19,289  -->  00:00:21,980
so far have been loaded through Python

10

00:00:21,990  -->  00:00:24,740
and served through Python and we

11

00:00:24,750  -->  00:00:26,000
actually can't link to any of these

12

00:00:26,010  -->  00:00:29,029
files just by putting a link into the

13

00:00:29,039  -->  00:00:32,299
template files. What we need to do if we

14

00:00:32,309  -->  00:00:35,900
want to load say a custom style sheet is

15

00:00:35,910  -->  00:00:38,600
we need to use the static files directive,

16

00:00:38,610  -->  00:00:41,720
and so how we do that is basically just

17

00:00:41,730  -->  00:00:43,790
in the settings file here make sure that

18

00:00:43,800  -->  00:00:45,020
at the bottom of your file you have a

19

00:00:45,030  -->  00:00:49,819
static URL constant set to this '/static/'

20

00:00:49,829  -->  00:00:51,770
and then what we're going to do is that

21

00:00:51,780  -->  00:00:57,139
relates to our...to each app. So what we're

22

00:00:57,149  -->  00:00:59,000
going to do is in the blog here we're

23

00:00:59,010  -->  00:01:00,860
going to create a new directory called

24

00:01:00,870  -->  00:01:06,109
static, and then in that static directory

25

00:01:06,119  -->  00:01:07,190
i'm going to create a new directory

26

00:01:07,200  -->  00:01:12,350
called css, and then in the css directory

27

00:01:12,360  -->  00:01:14,090
i'm going to create a new style sheet

28

00:01:14,100  -->  00:01:18,080
and i'm going to call it style.css. Now

29

00:01:18,090  -->  00:01:19,700
in here just to make sure it works i'm

30

00:01:19,710  -->  00:01:21,469
going to change the background of the

31

00:01:21,479  -->  00:01:26,570
body to an ungodly color of bright red "body {background:#f00;}"

32

00:01:26,580  -->  00:01:30,289
and to make sure that bootstrap doesn't

33

00:01:30,299  -->  00:01:32,300
override this going to add the "!important"

34

00:01:32,310  -->  00:01:35,480
flag here and this is going to make this

35

00:01:35,490  -->  00:01:39,080
always no matter how much specificity is

36

00:01:39,090  -->  00:01:42,289
involved in another CSS style

37

00:01:42,299  -->  00:01:44,960
this is not going to be overridden by

38

00:01:44,970  -->  00:01:48,260
any of those. Now what we're going to

39

00:01:48,270  -->  00:01:52,910
have to do is in the index file here, and

40

00:01:52,920  -->  00:01:54,679
drop down a few lines here, and i'm going

41

00:01:54,689  -->  00:01:59,450
to open up some ah so curly brackets and

42

00:01:59,460  -->  00:02:01,639
percent symbols here i'm going to

43

00:02:01,649  -->  00:02:04,609
call this tag from now on, that's what this is.

44

00:02:04,619  -->  00:02:07,819
So this allows us to enter Python code in

45

00:02:07,829  -->  00:02:10,160
Django code, so what I'm going to do is

46

00:02:10,170  -->  00:02:11,770
"{% load static %}"

47

00:02:11,780  -->  00:02:15,280
and then underneath that i'm going

48

00:02:15,290  -->  00:02:20,380
to add &lt;link rel="stylesheet"

49

00:02:20,390  -->  00:02:25,660
type="text/css and the

50

00:02:25,670  -->  00:02:33,130
href="{% static %}"

51

00:02:33,140  -->  00:02:36,790
and then in

52

00:02:36,800  -->  00:02:41,110
single quotes in here write 'css/style.css'

53

00:02:41,120  -->  00:02:47,949
and then save it, rerun the

54

00:02:47,959  -->  00:02:51,220
application, and if we refresh the page

55

00:02:51,230  -->  00:02:54,040
you'll see that this actually did work.

56

00:02:54,050  -->  00:03:02,350
Now, it looks like this has caused the

57

00:03:02,360  -->  00:03:05,410
bootstrap link to not work, so let me have a

58

00:03:05,420  -->  00:03:08,140
look there. We forgot to close it,

59

00:03:08,150  -->  00:03:12,070
there we go. So let's close that, refresh

60

00:03:12,080  -->  00:03:15,400
our application, and you'll see that now

61

00:03:15,410  -->  00:03:18,250
bootstrap and our custom CSS is working

62

00:03:18,260  -->  00:03:20,199
and it looks really terrible, so I'm

63

00:03:20,209  -->  00:03:22,750
going to end that here. In the next video

64

00:03:22,760  -->  00:03:24,400
you'll see this a little more styled and

65

00:03:24,410  -->  00:03:26,259
structured, and it will look more like a

66

00:03:26,269  -->  00:03:28,360
website. If you guys want to do that feel

67

00:03:28,370  -->  00:03:30,759
free, it's going to make things easier to

68

00:03:30,769  -->  00:03:33,280
navigate in the future doing this

69

00:03:33,290  -->  00:03:40,090
specific section of the course.
