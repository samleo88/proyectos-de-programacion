1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,730
Alright guys, so in this video we're

2

00:00:02,730  -->  00:00:04,319
going to make these progress bars

3

00:00:04,319  -->  00:00:07,770
actually update. So, how we're going to do

4

00:00:07,770  -->  00:00:10,290
that this calculation is going to be

5

00:00:10,290  -->  00:00:12,030
slightly different from this one and

6

00:00:12,030  -->  00:00:14,190
that's because this is 10 spaces wide

7

00:00:14,190  -->  00:00:19,710
and this is 25, and both go in

8

00:00:19,710  -->  00:00:22,470
to 100, they're divisible by 100 or go

9

00:00:22,470  -->  00:00:25,619
into 100, divisible by both, so for the

10

00:00:25,619  -->  00:00:30,300
first one for instance let's say, and

11

00:00:30,300  -->  00:00:31,890
we're going to use a really basic

12

00:00:31,890  -->  00:00:36,120
example calculation first so you guys

13

00:00:36,120  -->  00:00:39,780
can see. So, in order to calculate

14

00:00:39,780  -->  00:00:43,079
the difference you're going to divide

15

00:00:43,079  -->  00:00:49,379
the max HP by, or no a divide the

16

00:00:49,379  -->  00:00:52,860
current hit points by the max hitpoints,

17

00:00:52,860  -->  00:00:56,969
and then divide it by or times a

18

00:00:56,969  -->  00:01:01,590
100 divided by 4. Divided by 4 just because we

19

00:01:01,590  -->  00:01:04,680
want the maximum number to be 25, and

20

00:01:04,680  -->  00:01:05,519
then

21

00:01:05,519  -->  00:01:08,790
the other one divided by 4 as well so you know

22

00:01:08,790  -->  00:01:11,670
that would look accurate here. So, let me show you

23

00:01:11,670  -->  00:01:14,700
guys so let's say we're trying to get

24

00:01:14,700  -->  00:01:18,030
let's say our maximum hitpoints are 100,

25

00:01:18,030  -->  00:01:22,080
or 200 let's say, so let's say we

26

00:01:22,080  -->  00:01:25,890
have 200 hit points and we want to be

27

00:01:25,890  -->  00:01:29,640
able to put that into this grid of 25.

28

00:01:29,640  -->  00:01:31,770
What we're going to do is we're going to

29

00:01:31,770  -->  00:01:34,799
say our current hitpoints are 150, or let's

30

00:01:34,799  -->  00:01:41,670
say 50, so 50/200 is the maximum points,

31

00:01:41,670  -->  00:01:44,939
that's 0.25. Now to get that

32

00:01:44,939  -->  00:01:46,530
percentage we're going to multiply that

33

00:01:46,530  -->  00:01:48,810
by a 100, we're going to 25%,

34

00:01:48,810  -->  00:01:50,939
and then we need to divide that by

35

00:01:50,939  -->  00:01:54,390
four in order for it to fit our progress

36

00:01:54,390  -->  00:01:56,399
bar there, so divided by four and that's

37

00:01:56,399  -->  00:02:00,210
6.25 and that's going to round down to 6. So, it's

38

00:02:00,210  -->  00:02:03,210
going to be six spaces here. Let's go

39

00:02:03,210  -->  00:02:06,030
ahead and implement that.

40

00:02:06,030  -->  00:02:09,750
So, let's just do the entire

41

00:02:09,750  -->  00:02:12,870
calculation on the first row, so

42

00:02:12,870  -->  00:02:21,720
bar_ticks is going to be equal to self.hp/

43

00:02:21,720  -->  00:02:33,660
self.maxhp, we're going to do this first, then

44

00:02:33,660  -->  00:02:36,390
we're going to multiply that result by

45

00:02:36,390  -->  00:02:46,980
100, and then divide that by 4. Now

46

00:02:46,980  -->  00:02:50,400
what we need to do is we need to start at

47

00:02:50,400  -->  00:02:53,610
that number and work down to zero and

48

00:02:53,610  -->  00:02:56,880
for each tick, so for each integer in

49

00:02:56,880  -->  00:03:01,350
that, we need to add one of these to the

50

00:03:01,350  -->  00:03:08,010
bar. So, create a bar here equal to an

51

00:03:08,010  -->  00:03:13,019
empty string. So, what we're going to do

52

00:03:13,019  -->  00:03:28,079
is while bar_ticks is greater than 0,

53

00:03:28,079  -->  00:03:34,320
we're going to say bar += and then that.

54

00:03:34,320  -->  00:03:40,470
Then, we're going to say bar_ticks -=, so

55

00:03:40,470  -->  00:03:42,510
we're going to take away one and we're going to

56

00:03:42,510  -->  00:03:47,010
continue along until that reaches zero,

57

00:03:47,010  -->  00:03:49,440
Now I think I need to make that greater

58

00:03:49,440  -->  00:03:50,790
than or equal to,

59

00:03:50,790  -->  00:03:53,370
but we will find out. What we're going to

60

00:03:53,370  -->  00:03:56,549
do is we also need to figure out how

61

00:03:56,549  -->  00:04:00,720
many empty spaces we need, so let me just

62

00:04:00,720  -->  00:04:02,220
think about that for a moment we'll

63

00:04:02,220  -->  00:04:06,540
figure out how to do that. Let's create

64

00:04:06,540  -->  00:04:12,420
a second variable here, and I know hold

65

00:04:12,420  -->  00:04:18,769
on, and then we need to create a while

66

00:04:18,769  -->  00:04:29,720
len(bar) &lt; 25: we need to

67

00:04:29,720  -->  00:04:33,949
go bar += and then just a space, this

68

00:04:33,949  -->  00:04:35,629
should work. Then what we're going to do

69

00:04:35,629  -->  00:04:41,990
is we are going to print out our bar,

70

00:04:41,990  -->  00:04:47,000
hitpoint bar actually, right there.

71

00:04:47,000  -->  00:04:51,740
So, let name this hp_bar because we're

72

00:04:51,740  -->  00:05:00,319
going to be doing the same thing for

73

00:05:00,319  -->  00:05:06,530
magic points after as well. So, this

74

00:05:06,530  -->  00:05:12,050
should work, now it should, we need to give

75

00:05:12,050  -->  00:05:14,509
the enemy and the enemy is actually

76

00:05:14,509  -->  00:05:17,659
attacking the first character for some

77

00:05:17,659  -->  00:05:20,900
reason, so that's cool. I don't remember

78

00:05:20,900  -->  00:05:24,469
if I did that, yeah we did, player 1 always

79

00:05:24,469  -->  00:05:26,630
takes damage. Alright, so we need to give

80

00:05:26,630  -->  00:05:29,509
the enemy since we increase the hit

81

00:05:29,509  -->  00:05:32,210
points we need to actually give the

82

00:05:32,210  -->  00:05:35,779
enemy quite a bit more attack power

83

00:05:35,779  -->  00:05:38,060
there, and we'll give ourselves more

84

00:05:38,060  -->  00:05:41,630
attack power as well. So, we'll say 132,

85

00:05:41,630  -->  00:05:46,009
this guys is going to have 188, and he's

86

00:05:46,009  -->  00:05:52,069
gonna have 174. Save this.

87

00:05:52,069  -->  00:05:59,029
Alright, so let's go ahead and start it, and

88

00:05:59,029  -->  00:06:01,219
something terrible has happened right

89

00:06:01,219  -->  00:06:04,699
there. Let me see is that...

90

00:06:04,699  -->  00:06:08,810
yeah so that's definitely it right there. So, we

91

00:06:08,810  -->  00:06:14,520
forgot to end some colors somewhere.

92

00:06:14,520  -->  00:06:24,060
Start this again,

93

00:06:24,060  -->  00:06:28,650
there we go. But, now these got pushed back

94

00:06:28,650  -->  00:06:31,050
for some reason. Anyway, let's just make

95

00:06:31,050  -->  00:06:33,180
sure that it works.

96

00:06:33,180  -->  00:06:35,370
Everyone's going to attack him and he's

97

00:06:35,370  -->  00:06:39,599
going to attack us. We need to give him a

98

00:06:39,599  -->  00:06:42,330
big attack power for this to work I

99

00:06:42,330  -->  00:06:53,280
think. Let's go ahead and give him 701

100

00:06:53,280  -->  00:07:04,800
attack power, there we go.

101

00:07:04,800  -->  00:07:08,909
Alright,

102

00:07:08,909  -->  00:07:15,300
no, that's magic points.

103

00:07:15,300  -->  00:07:18,060
Alright, well, everyone has more magic

104

00:07:18,060  -->  00:07:20,340
point so I guess that works. Let's try this again through

105

00:07:20,340  -->  00:07:22,860
the order that I passed those

106

00:07:22,860  -->  00:07:24,810
things in through. As you can see a notch

107

00:07:24,810  -->  00:07:29,190
has been taken off our hitpoint bar, and another one,

108

00:07:29,190  -->  00:07:35,250
we're going to keep going until...oh,

109

00:07:35,250  -->  00:07:37,560
I already won, cool.

110

00:07:37,560  -->  00:07:42,180
Alright, and that's because we have

111

00:07:42,180  -->  00:07:49,349
higher hitpoints so let's make him have 11,200. That's

112

00:07:49,349  -->  00:07:50,639
going to be a little more difficult plus

113

00:07:50,639  -->  00:07:52,919
he has a lot of magic points. So our

114

00:07:52,919  -->  00:07:55,979
progress bar does in fact work, he needs a

115

00:07:55,979  -->  00:08:08,480
bit higher attack power though. Let's try 315,

116

00:08:08,480  -->  00:08:13,610
and if I use magic and I cure myself,

117

00:08:13,610  -->  00:08:17,510
now the cures are still pretty weak

118

00:08:17,510  -->  00:08:20,030
because we've scaled a lot of other

119

00:08:20,030  -->  00:08:27,980
things up, we haven't scaled the magic.

120

00:08:27,980  -->  00:08:38,889
Let's go ahead up here...

121

00:08:38,889  -->  00:08:42,159
the standard spells do 600 points

122

00:08:42,159  -->  00:08:49,989
of damage, this does 1200, and then cure is

123

00:08:49,989  -->  00:08:56,139
going to heal 620 points, and cure

124

00:08:56,139  -->  00:09:01,629
is going to heal 1500. So, let's try

125

00:09:01,629  -->  00:09:02,529
this again.

126

00:09:02,529  -->  00:09:08,410
Let's attack and let's get damage going for

127

00:09:08,410  -->  00:09:10,569
our first character. Now I'm going to choose

128

00:09:10,569  -->  00:09:17,049
magic, I'm going to choose cura, and we

129

00:09:17,049  -->  00:09:19,419
can see that my hitpoints have gone back up for

130

00:09:19,419  -->  00:09:20,799
the most of the part but then he

131

00:09:20,799  -->  00:09:22,239
attacked me again.

132

00:09:22,239  -->  00:09:24,730
Alright, so, we are also going to

133

00:09:24,730  -->  00:09:28,689
need to create another potion let's just

134

00:09:28,689  -->  00:09:34,329
make that heal for a 1000, grenade  500,

135

00:09:34,329  -->  00:09:39,879
yeah. Alright, so, we also need to modify

136

00:09:39,879  -->  00:09:41,829
the hielixir to go ahead and heal you

137

00:09:41,829  -->  00:09:45,160
know all party members, etc., etc., but first

138

00:09:45,160  -->  00:09:46,779
we need to make the magic points bar

139

00:09:46,779  -->  00:09:51,759
work as well, and that is exactly the

140

00:09:51,759  -->  00:09:55,059
same but instead of divided by four its going to

141

00:09:55,059  -->  00:10:00,309
be divided by ten. So, mp_bar equals an empty

142

00:10:00,309  -->  00:10:06,910
string, and then mp_ticks is going to be equal to self.mp

143

00:10:06,910  -->  00:10:11,799
divided by self.maxmp *

144

00:10:11,799  -->  00:10:19,959
100 / 10. And then down here we're going

145

00:10:19,959  -->  00:10:23,259
to say while

146

00:10:23,259  -->  00:10:35,980
mp_ticks is greater than 0: mp_bar +=

147

00:10:35,980  -->  00:10:40,769
we're going to say this,

148

00:10:40,769  -->  00:10:51,239
and mp_ticks -=, and then fill up the rest of

149

00:10:51,239  -->  00:10:57,149
the mp_bar with a blank space. So, while

150

00:10:57,149  -->  00:11:04,350
mp_bar length is less than 10,

151

00:11:04,350  -->  00:11:09,929
mp_bar += an empty space.

152

00:11:09,929  -->  00:11:13,139
What we're going to do is replace this

153

00:11:13,139  -->  00:11:18,809
bit right here with mp_bar. Let's save

154

00:11:18,809  -->  00:11:21,569
that. Now when I use magic you'll see

155

00:11:21,569  -->  00:11:30,119
that my magic will reduce as well. Not

156

00:11:30,119  -->  00:11:32,670
much though because we chose to, but the numbers

157

00:11:32,670  -->  00:11:35,249
are working correctly, because we need to

158

00:11:35,249  -->  00:11:39,329
now scale up the cost of each of these.

159

00:11:39,329  -->  00:11:47,850
So, 25, 25, 25, meteor is going to be 40

160

00:11:47,850  -->  00:11:50,759
magic points, and then quake is a really weak

161

00:11:50,759  -->  00:11:55,860
spell. Cure is going to cost 25, and then

162

00:11:55,860  -->  00:11:57,569
cura is going to be the next step up and it's going to

163

00:11:57,569  -->  00:12:08,279
cost 32. So, there we go. So, we're

164

00:12:08,279  -->  00:12:10,470
going to adjust strength and everything

165

00:12:10,470  -->  00:12:12,629
as well because as you'll notice the

166

00:12:12,629  -->  00:12:15,480
attack does 63 points of damage where

167

00:12:15,480  -->  00:12:18,119
magic is now doing about you know the

168

00:12:18,119  -->  00:12:20,490
standard spells are doing 600, so we're

169

00:12:20,490  -->  00:12:21,480
going to set the strength of each

170

00:12:21,480  -->  00:12:29,200
character to about 300.

171

00:12:29,200  -->  00:12:32,650
This one's going to have the weakest

172

00:12:32,650  -->  00:12:37,300
attack i guess at 288, and we're going to

173

00:12:37,300  -->  00:12:40,390
make the enemy's strength a lot stronger

174

00:12:40,390  -->  00:12:41,740
so that it feels like more of a

175

00:12:41,740  -->  00:12:50,800
challenge. We're gonna set that 525 and

176

00:12:50,800  -->  00:12:52,060
the defense we're actually going to make

177

00:12:52,060  -->  00:12:53,800
that take effect as well, but for right

178

00:12:53,800  -->  00:12:55,870
now we've got a basic

179

00:12:55,870  -->  00:12:58,240
multi-party system working. i need to

180

00:12:58,240  -->  00:13:00,670
straighten up that line by adding one

181

00:13:00,670  -->  00:13:03,790
space in front of the words mp and the

182

00:13:03,790  -->  00:13:08,950
align, So, mp, doesn't show it there, so

183

00:13:08,950  -->  00:13:11,740
one space in front of the line there, and then

184

00:13:11,740  -->  00:13:15,700
in the main.py where the mp

185

00:13:15,700  -->  00:13:19,060
printed there. Let's add a space and it should look a

186

00:13:19,060  -->  00:13:20,680
lot better.

187

00:13:20,680  -->  00:13:25,030
Nope, one more.

188

00:13:25,030  -->  00:13:28,960
There we go. So, back over here, that other on there, and

189

00:13:28,960  -->  00:13:31,240
then right on.

190

00:13:31,240  -->  00:13:34,300
So, what we need to do the same thing

191

00:13:34,300  -->  00:13:36,070
here the hitpoints we're going to assume

192

00:13:36,070  -->  00:13:40,780
are always four digits, so what we're

193

00:13:40,780  -->  00:13:43,060
going to do is we're going to add well,

194

00:13:43,060  -->  00:13:45,370
yeah let's do that right quick as well.

195

00:13:45,370  -->  00:14:02,230
So, if ok, so let's set chp = self.mp

196

00:14:02,230  -->  00:14:04,210
because we only want to modify in this

197

00:14:04,210  -->  00:14:13,510
instance. So, if len(chp) &lt; 4: I'm

198

00:14:13,510  -->  00:14:21,810
going to say...

199

00:14:21,810  -->  00:14:38,520
yeah, okay. So, we're gonna have to get the lenght of it, I'm just trying to

200

00:14:38,520  -->  00:14:40,110
think of the best way to do this here.

201

00:14:40,110  -->  00:14:41,910
We're going to create another string

202

00:14:41,910  -->  00:14:46,110
called shp, it's going to be a blank string for now,

203

00:14:46,110  -->  00:14:52,320
we're going to get the length of chp.

204

00:14:52,320  -->  00:15:03,270
So, if it's less than 4, a while it's less

205

00:15:03,270  -->  00:15:10,649
than 4 I guess?

206

00:15:10,649  -->  00:15:27,680
While...

207

00:15:27,680  -->  00:15:30,080
this might have catastrophic

208

00:15:30,080  -->  00:15:34,700
consequences. So, let's assume that the

209

00:15:34,700  -->  00:15:37,100
current hit points were like 200

210

00:15:37,100  -->  00:15:40,100
something. Actually, let's see if we can...

211

00:15:40,100  -->  00:15:43,190
I'll just do this in the next video, I'm

212

00:15:43,190  -->  00:15:45,290
going to try to work something out for a

213

00:15:45,290  -->  00:15:48,709
really easy way to do that. So, yeah,

214

00:15:48,709  -->  00:15:50,630
for now we've got the these working

215

00:15:50,630  -->  00:15:52,790
completely and that's all we're going to

216

00:15:52,790  -->  00:15:54,170
be focusing on right now. In the next

217

00:15:54,170  -->  00:15:56,870
video I guess we are going to account

218

00:15:56,870  -->  00:15:58,459
for white extra white space if this

219

00:15:58,459  -->  00:16:00,320
falls below three digits and if this

220

00:16:00,320  -->  00:16:02,270
falls below four digits we're going to

221

00:16:02,270  -->  00:16:06,529
preceed the string of hit points with an

222

00:16:06,529  -->  00:16:08,870
extra space, or however many spaces are

223

00:16:08,870  -->  00:16:14,140
needed.
