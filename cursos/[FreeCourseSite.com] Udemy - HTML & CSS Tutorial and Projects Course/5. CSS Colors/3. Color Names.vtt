Awesome we are experts on color properties.

00:03.920 --> 00:05.590
What about the values.

00:05.590 --> 00:08.840
Well our most basic option would be using color names.

00:08.960 --> 00:12.070
And this is as as straightforward as it gets.

00:12.130 --> 00:17.440
Every time we're gonna be using the property let's say color or background color more to shorthand for

00:17.440 --> 00:21.160
the background we would want to use some kind of color name.

00:21.160 --> 00:25.610
Now what's neat about Visual Studio code that it gives the suggestions.

00:25.630 --> 00:31.300
So if I add one color name starting with Y it's gonna give me the color name starting with Y.

00:31.540 --> 00:37.330
IF I'M GONNA START WITH A it's gonna give me color names with a and you get the point there is hundred

00:37.330 --> 00:40.970
and forty of the color names if you would like to know all of them.

00:41.050 --> 00:46.360
You can again head over to W three schools and just start scrolling down and you'll see all the color

00:46.360 --> 00:47.050
names.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.500
Now like I said this is just gonna be as basic as it gets.

00:50.620 --> 00:57.040
Every time you would want to have a color or background color property you can always pick a value from

00:57.040 --> 00:57.780
the color names.
