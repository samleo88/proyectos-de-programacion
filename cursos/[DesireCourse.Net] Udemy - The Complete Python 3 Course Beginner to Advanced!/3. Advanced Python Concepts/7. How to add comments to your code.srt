00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,319
So something we haven't discussed yet is
how to make comments in your code, which

2

00:00:04,319  -->  00:00:09,210
is very important when you are getting
into any type of coding. Now, this is

3

00:00:09,210  -->  00:00:13,590
important for a few reasons. First off,
you know you might write a ton of code

4

00:00:13,590  -->  00:00:18,750
one day and just to try to get as much of
its can, and then you come back to later

5

00:00:18,750  -->  00:00:26,849
and it seems maybe you can't you know
remember why you did something, and so

6

00:00:26,849  -->  00:00:32,460
this is a way to leave notes for you to
look at in the future, or for other

7

00:00:32,460  -->  00:00:36,239
developers to be able to kind of
understand what you're doing as well.

8

00:00:36,239  -->  00:00:44,250
So let's go ahead and open the first
program here. Now there are two types of

9

00:00:44,250  -->  00:00:50,670
comments you can leave in Python, one is
a single line comment, and the other is a

10

00:00:50,670  -->  00:00:55,590
is a multi-line comment. So for instance,
let's go ahead and at the very top of this

11

00:00:55,590  -->  00:01:00,449
program let's add a multi-line comment.
How you do that is you create ' ' '

12

00:01:00,449  -->  00:01:07,710
quotes, and then anything inside these
three quotes is going to be interpreted

13

00:01:07,710  -->  00:01:15,720
as a comment. So, for instance, we can
write "Program: Magical Calculator"

14

00:01:15,720  -->  00:01:33,119
"Author: Nick G" "Copyright 2016" and so that's how you can add multi-line comments and

15

00:01:33,119  -->  00:01:36,960
you can do this anywhere in your code on
a new line. Now, for a single comment

16

00:01:36,960  -->  00:01:42,630
you're just going to do it like this, so
for instance let me indent here, just

17

00:01:42,630  -->  00:01:46,560
put a hash sign "#" there, and then anything after this hash sign on the single line

18

00:01:46,560  -->  00:01:55,590
will be interpreted as a comment. So, "# if
user quits --&gt;" this kind of explains the

19

00:01:55,590  -->  00:02:00,600
next block of code here so anybody
looking through the code will realize

20

00:02:00,600  -->  00:02:02,579
okay well if the user quits

21

00:02:02,579  -->  00:02:08,729
that's what this relates to. So, let's go
ahead and add another one here,

22

00:02:09,850  -->  00:02:24,040
"# If there has been a previous calculation, use that result as the prompt" there we go,

23

00:02:24,040  -->  00:02:28,000
and so as you can see comments are going to become really useful as we code.
