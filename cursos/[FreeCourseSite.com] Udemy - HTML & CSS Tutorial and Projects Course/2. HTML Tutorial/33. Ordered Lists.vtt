00:00.120 --> 00:03.460
Similarly we can also create or enlist.

00:03.600 --> 00:08.900
So first let me just delete the analyst and again syntax would be exactly the same.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.730
Difference would be we're not looking 40 on our list which has the element 9 if you will.

00:14.760 --> 00:20.480
We're looking for the order list within the element name would be oh well and here again we're gonna

00:20.490 --> 00:21.530
do the lie.

00:21.750 --> 00:27.720
And again maybe let's write some dummy texts or the first word list item would be John.

00:27.750 --> 00:34.520
Then the second one will be Peter and the third one we're gonna have SARAH AND LET'S SEE WHAT WE'RE

00:34.530 --> 00:39.360
GONNA HAVE NOT SORRY BUT SARAH And the moment will save it.

00:39.360 --> 00:41.780
Notice that this would be number one.

00:41.970 --> 00:44.040
Number two and number three.

00:44.040 --> 00:47.050
Again the same idea as with an order list.

00:47.100 --> 00:50.110
Or we would need to use the different element name.

00:50.310 --> 00:53.550
And then we would have the ordered list instead of unordered list.
