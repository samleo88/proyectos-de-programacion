00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,840
Hey guys, welcome back. Before we continue with anything and I think we're getting

2

00:00:03,840  -->  00:00:08,700
close to the end of the Web.py module,
but before we even finish it we need to

3

00:00:08,700  -->  00:00:13,200
talk about relative datetimes because
they're so important in today's day and

4

00:00:13,200  -->  00:00:17,369
age. People don't like to see full date
times printed out, like in Unix time or

5

00:00:17,369  -->  00:00:21,840
anything, they want to see pretty
relative dates. So like instead of seeing

6

00:00:21,840  -->  00:00:31,080
September 15, 2016 at 11:18 am, what they would like to see is like a minute ago,

7

00:00:31,080  -->  00:00:32,340
you know.

8

00:00:32,340  -->  00:00:35,790
So what we're going to do is we're going
to install a package, so go ahead and

9

00:00:35,790  -->  00:00:39,750
write "pip3 install" and then the package
we're going to install is called "humanize"

10

00:00:39,750  -->  00:00:45,989
Now i've already installed this, you
guys will need to, it's pretty simple it

11

00:00:45,989  -->  00:00:49,829
shouldn't get stuck or anything and you should now have this installed. So what we're

12

00:00:49,829  -->  00:00:53,579
going to do with this let's launch a Python
shell "python3" and i'm going to show you guys how

13

00:00:53,579  -->  00:00:58,109
to use this. So, first we're going to
"import humanize" and then we're going

14

00:00:58,109  -->  00:01:05,189
to "import datetime" Now as you can see up here

15

00:01:05,189  -->  00:01:10,770
the current time is 11:18 AM, so what I'm going to do is

16

00:01:10,770  -->  00:01:17,159
I'm going to set a variable called
"posted_date" and this is going to be

17

00:01:17,159  -->  00:01:24,090
"= datetime.datetime( )" and here
we're going to enter the "2016, 9,

18

00:01:24,090  -->  00:01:30,780
15, 11, 14"  so
in this case let's say 14. So this is

19

00:01:30,780  -->  00:01:38,520
going to be equal to September 15, 2016

20
11:14 AM. So let's hit enter. Now what we

21

00:01:38,520  -->  00:01:44,250
need to do is we need to essentially
humanize this and how we're going to do

22

00:01:44,250  -->  00:01:52,229
that is by typing out the following. So
you first you need to access "humanize" and

23

00:01:52,229  -->  00:01:58,200
then inside in that class there is a
method called ".naturaltime" which does

24

00:01:58,200  -->  00:02:03,960
not adhere to pep guidelines because
there should be an underscore between

25

00:02:03,960  -->  00:02:09,959
natural and time, but there's not, and
then this is a method so open up your

26

00:02:09,959  -->  00:02:12,990
"( )" and then what you're going
to do is pass it two arguments.

27

00:02:12,990  -->  00:02:17,280
The first one is going to be the current
date time so we're just going to go

28

00:02:17,280  -->  00:02:26,700
"datetime.datetime.now( )" minus whatever date you want to print out relative time.

29

00:02:26,700  -->  00:02:31,230
So in this case I've stored in a
variable called "- posted_date" and you'll

30

00:02:31,230  -->  00:02:36,030
see that prints out '6 minutes ago' and
so when we're working with dates in

31

00:02:36,030  -->  00:02:40,800
our application with Webpy, this is how
we're going to do it. So let's get into

32

00:02:40,800  -->  00:02:41,300
that.
