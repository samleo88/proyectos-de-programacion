00:00.420 --> 00:01.380
And first things first.

00:01.380 --> 00:07.140
Why don't we start with the very basics where any time you're going to want to work would see us as

00:07.140 --> 00:07.840
grid.

00:07.890 --> 00:09.680
You're going to need two things.

00:09.870 --> 00:15.540
You're going to need a parent container that's going to have display set the grid.

00:15.540 --> 00:17.950
And second you're going to need some children item.

00:17.980 --> 00:19.610
So that could be one child.

00:19.710 --> 00:25.710
That could be thousand children within that parent container and those would be the basics of C says

00:25.710 --> 00:26.330
grid.

00:26.350 --> 00:26.650
All right.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.820
Now if you don't have that if you're not going to have the parent container sets it says grid or you're

00:32.820 --> 00:36.060
going to have some kind of parent container with no children.

00:36.060 --> 00:40.440
Well it's not going to be possible for you to experience these things as grid.

00:40.500 --> 00:48.870
Now once we understand the very very basics why don't we look at the most important two properties that

00:48.870 --> 00:52.590
we can use a lot when we're working with C assessed grid.

00:52.980 --> 00:55.740
So first and foremost let's target container.

00:56.150 --> 01:00.720
And like so man I would like to set up a selector.

01:01.050 --> 01:04.820
So I'm setting up my selector and what kind of styles out one.

01:04.950 --> 01:09.480
Well like I said for the parent I'm going to need display grid.

01:09.610 --> 01:10.800
And that's number one.

01:10.930 --> 01:21.300
And second I said a very very important property is going to be grid template columns and in most cases

01:21.300 --> 01:27.000
this is the property that you are going to use when you work and would see us as grid.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.350
So first and foremost set display as grid or the parent container.

01:31.350 --> 01:39.450
And then in order to set up your columns you're going to use grid hyphen template hyphen columns and

01:39.450 --> 01:46.770
then the syntax is following where I'm just coming up with how many columns I would like to have if

01:46.770 --> 01:48.590
you'd want to have two columns.

01:48.600 --> 01:55.140
Well it couldn't be easier which is right the width of the column which in my case is going to be 200

01:55.170 --> 02:01.740
pixels and that corresponds to a first column and then I need to come up with well what will be the

02:01.740 --> 02:03.540
size of the second column.

02:03.540 --> 02:08.460
And in this case I'm going to go with three hundred and that's at the moment we do that.

02:08.460 --> 02:10.500
I do have right away.

02:10.500 --> 02:12.440
My CEO says grid setup.

02:12.480 --> 02:19.110
Now in this case I'm going to zoom model but because as you can see if I had really zoom then while

02:19.170 --> 02:26.480
it was out of my screen right now I also may be going to make this little bit bigger my browser window.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.530
So that way you can clearly see.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.440
So it couldn't be easier.

02:30.510 --> 02:35.180
We have parent container then in this case we have two children.

02:35.460 --> 02:43.530
And then if I would want to have a two column layout with my sister's grid I just head over to my parent

02:43.530 --> 02:51.990
container selected then make sure that it is set as display grid and then use the grid template columns

02:51.990 --> 02:57.130
property where I can specifically say what kind of columns I would like.

02:57.300 --> 03:00.480
What would be the width of the columns and how many columns.

03:00.510 --> 03:06.920
So in this case inside I want two columns I just write 200 pixel value first and then 300 picks over

03:07.280 --> 03:08.300
and there you go.

03:08.380 --> 03:11.750
I have a grid layout with two columns.
