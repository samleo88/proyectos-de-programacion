00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,980
Hey guys, so the last section of videos
we learned about how to get data and

2

00:00:04,980  -->  00:00:10,170
HTML from the internet using Python, but
we haven't really learned how to do

3

00:00:10,170  -->  00:00:14,460
anything fun with it yet, and so that's
what we're going to be getting to now by

4

00:00:14,460  -->  00:00:20,039
discovering a package called beautiful
soup. So, I believe it's bs4 that we

5

00:00:20,039  -->  00:00:31,199
need to install, so go ahead and open up
terminal and type "pip3 install ps4" and once

6

00:00:31,199  -->  00:00:34,200
it installs we should be able to just
use it right away just like any other

7

00:00:34,200  -->  00:00:35,280
package.

8

00:00:35,280  -->  00:00:46,980
Let's go ahead and close terminal, open
up PyCharm here, let's just go ahead

9

00:00:46,980  -->  00:00:53,039
and start a new project it's going to be
pure Python, let's get rid of that, and we're going to

10

00:00:53,039  -->  00:01:01,350
name it web scraperery. So basically
when you get data from the internet it's

11

00:01:01,350  -->  00:01:08,610
called web scraping, so this module is
going to really help you guys do web

12

00:01:08,610  -->  00:01:14,220
scraping tasks. So, the way we do that is
using beautiful soup so let's go ahead

13

00:01:14,220  -->  00:01:23,729
and create a new file, just name it
"main" let's write "from bs4

14

00:01:23,729  -->  00:01:30,090
import BeautifulSoup" that's all you
need to do. Now we're gonna have to also

15

00:01:30,090  -->  00:01:33,810
use requests in order to get the data,
and then once we get the data we're

16

00:01:33,810  -->  00:01:38,700
going to convert it into a beautiful
soup, and then we're going to parse that

17

00:01:38,700  -->  00:01:42,630
beautiful soup and do different stuff
with the content that would get. So let's

18

00:01:42,630  -->  00:01:55,829
also go ahead "import requests" So let's
build a request here, and what we're

19

00:01:55,829  -->  00:01:59,130
going to do is we're going to go to
Bing because Bing is a search engine

20

00:01:59,130  -->  00:02:06,360
that we can search quite easily, and
let's search for

21

00:02:06,360  -->  00:02:17,790
pizza. What we need from here is just
the URL right here.

22

00:02:18,480  -->  00:02:23,820
So what we're going to do is we are
going to send a get parameter, so let's

23

00:02:23,820  -->  00:02:31,020
build up params object "params = {"q": search}"

24

00:02:31,020  -->  00:02:42,120
we haven't built that yet, but just one sec, so we're going to set the

25

00:02:42,120  -->  00:02:49,680
URL to this "(http://www.bing.com/search", params=params)" Then the search variable is going to

26

00:02:49,680  -->  00:02:52,739
actually, we need to ask what we want to search for, so this is

27

00:02:52,739  -->  00:03:01,020
going to be kind of an interactive program.So let's go ahead and "print("Enter Search Term:")"

28

00:03:01,020  -->  00:03:12,120
actually let's just make this input,
so let's go ahead and create a search

29

00:03:12,120  -->  00:03:22,019
variable "search = input("Enter search term:")"

30

00:03:22,019  -->  00:03:25,650
So what's going to happen is the first thing it's going to ask is what we want search

31

00:03:25,650  -->  00:03:29,760
for, we're going to get that, we're going
to send it along as the q get

32

00:03:29,760  -->  00:03:35,790
variable in parameters to this URL, and
we'll get the results from the page of

33

00:03:35,790  -->  00:03:40,049
what we searched for. So now that we have that we are then going to turn it a

34

00:03:40,049  -->  00:03:44,760
beautiful soup. so let's go ahead and
create a variable called "soup =

35

00:03:44,760  -->  00:03:51,299
BeautifulSoup" and what we're going to
pass into this class beautiful soup is

36

00:03:51,299  -->  00:03:57,480
going to be the actual text of the document. So, it should just be

37

00:03:57,480  -->  00:04:09,570
"(r.text)" and then we can "print(soup.prettify( ))"

38

00:04:12,040  -->  00:04:28,120
Let's go ahead and save, let's run this. So we want to search for "pizza." So it did get

39

00:04:28,120  -->  00:04:45,430
it, it let me scroll up, Bing has a lot
of code in their pages. So, there. No parser

40

00:04:45,430  -->  00:04:49,570
was explicitly specified, so using the
best HTML parser for the system which is

41

00:04:49,570  -->  00:04:55,090
HTML parser. Now we could manually pass that into the beautiful soup if we, it says

42

00:04:55,090  -->  00:05:02,770
right here if we in the the beautiful
soup call what we can do is just pass

43

00:05:02,770  -->  00:05:07,750
that in as well "html.parser" We won't get that error but then happened was we got the results,

44

00:05:07,750  -->  00:05:15,160
and we printed out a prettified version
of the soup that we just made. So, what we

45

00:05:15,160  -->  00:05:20,740
can do with this is we can actually find
certain contents from within the soup

46

00:05:20,740  -->  00:05:22,630
and use that, and that's what we're going to do in the next video.
