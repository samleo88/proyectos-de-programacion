1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,040
Alright, so we're able to do damage with

2

00:00:02,040  -->  00:00:03,870
our magic but we also want to be able to

3

00:00:03,870  -->  00:00:06,690
heal. Now instead of checking against the

4

00:00:06,690  -->  00:00:09,360
name which I did previously and then the

5

00:00:09,360  -->  00:00:11,429
video didn't get recorded or uploaded so

6

00:00:11,429  -->  00:00:17,130
I have to re-do it again, so basically in that section of

7

00:00:17,130  -->  00:00:18,840
video which technically I guess doesn't

8

00:00:18,840  -->  00:00:20,130
exist

9

00:00:20,130  -->  00:00:21,840
we just checked against the name. We said

10

00:00:21,840  -->  00:00:26,939
if spell name equals cure the heal, but

11

00:00:26,939  -->  00:00:28,769
the problem now is we've got two

12

00:00:28,769  -->  00:00:32,279
cure spells but the good thing is that

13

00:00:32,279  -->  00:00:34,680
they're defined both as white magic, so

14

00:00:34,680  -->  00:00:36,780
we can check against the spell type

15

00:00:36,780  -->  00:00:39,480
if we heal. What we're going to do is

16

00:00:39,480  -->  00:00:41,879
we're going to go to our magic section.

17

00:00:41,879  -->  00:00:44,850
So, if we choose magic what we need to do

18

00:00:44,850  -->  00:00:54,000
here is right here outside of that if

19

00:00:54,000  -->  00:00:56,160
statement, and after everything else,

20

00:00:56,160  -->  00:00:57,539
so basically what's going to

21

00:00:57,539  -->  00:00:59,430
happen is we get the prompt, we choose

22

00:00:59,430  -->  00:01:02,250
magic, and then we actually input our

23

00:01:02,250  -->  00:01:07,080
choice, and then we set spell and then the magic

24

00:01:07,080  -->  00:01:09,659
damage which is basically just the value

25

00:01:09,659  -->  00:01:13,170
of it either heal or damage, we're going to

26

00:01:13,170  -->  00:01:15,119
call that damage even though it's not

27

00:01:15,119  -->  00:01:17,460
damage it's still hit points, okay we

28

00:01:17,460  -->  00:01:19,350
should have called that hit point

29

00:01:19,350  -->  00:01:24,900
modification, or something. Anyway, we get

30

00:01:24,900  -->  00:01:27,299
current MP and then we basically say if

31

00:01:27,299  -->  00:01:29,220
there's not enough MP to do this, otherwise

32

00:01:29,220  -->  00:01:34,950
we're going to do this. If spell type

33

00:01:34,950  -->  00:01:41,340
equals light we're going to say, actually

34

00:01:41,340  -->  00:01:43,079
we can also reduce the MP there

35

00:01:43,079  -->  00:01:46,079
automatically, that's not part of the

36

00:01:46,079  -->  00:01:50,460
condition, so up here above this bit of code, so

37

00:01:50,460  -->  00:01:52,950
if spell type equals white we're going

38

00:01:52,950  -->  00:01:58,530
to say player heal for a magic damage did we

39

00:01:58,530  -->  00:02:00,630
call it?

40

00:02:00,630  -->  00:02:06,610
Yes, magic damage.

41

00:02:06,610  -->  00:02:14,140
Then we're going to print out

42

00:02:14,140  -->  00:02:39,750
bcolors.OKBLUE, we are gonna do a new line, spell.name heals for,

43

00:02:39,750  -->  00:02:44,160
and we're going to say bcolors and

44

00:02:44,160  -->  00:02:53,310
ENDC. elif spell.type == "black": so if it's

45

00:02:53,310  -->  00:02:55,260
black magic it's going to be attack

46

00:02:55,260  -->  00:03:01,230
magic. And I put

47

00:03:01,230  -->  00:03:03,180
that in an elif statement instead of just

48

00:03:03,180  -->  00:03:06,030
an else statement because we might add

49

00:03:06,030  -->  00:03:08,670
red magic and that status effects to our

50

00:03:08,670  -->  00:03:15,090
RPG as well. Now let's go ahead and rerun

51

00:03:15,090  -->  00:03:18,660
this, we're going to start by attacking,

52

00:03:18,660  -->  00:03:20,310
and as we can see our hit points are

53

00:03:20,310  -->  00:03:22,800
dropping quite a bit here. So, now what I'm

54

00:03:22,800  -->  00:03:24,959
going to do is I'm going to choose magic, i'm

55

00:03:24,959  -->  00:03:28,320
going to choose cura which cost 18, and as

56

00:03:28,320  -->  00:03:30,989
you can see cura heals from 195 and my

57

00:03:30,989  -->  00:03:37,530
hit points go down from to 234 - 45 + 195

58

00:03:37,530  -->  00:03:41,400
and I'm left with 384 hit points. So our

59

00:03:41,400  -->  00:03:45,810
cure spells do in fact work. We'll heal again

60

00:03:45,810  -->  00:03:47,820
to get up to 416 and we're going to

61

00:03:47,820  -->  00:03:49,860
devastate the enemy with a meteor

62

00:03:49,860  -->  00:03:52,799
attack, and they have a lot of points so

63

00:03:52,799  -->  00:03:57,030
doesn't really impact that much. So

64

00:03:57,030  -->  00:04:00,030
that's how we heal and the enemy is

65

00:04:00,030  -->  00:04:01,560
going to be able to heal as well, so it's

66

00:04:01,560  -->  00:04:02,670
going to make it more difficult, and

67

00:04:02,670  -->  00:04:04,799
we're actually also going to add items

68

00:04:04,799  -->  00:04:10,940
in to the mix.
