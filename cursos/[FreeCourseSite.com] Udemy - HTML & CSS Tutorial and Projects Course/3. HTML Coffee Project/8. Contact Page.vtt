00:00.480 --> 00:07.050
The last page in our project is gonna be contact page where again we have tons of things that we have

00:07.050 --> 00:13.320
from the indexation email page meaning our homepage but we to the form we're in there is gonna be the

00:13.320 --> 00:18.350
name input email input as well as the description text there.

00:18.390 --> 00:21.220
Now let's head over back to our project.

00:21.270 --> 00:26.050
First let's create the page so we're going to say contact H.

00:26.100 --> 00:32.240
Now that's going to be your name and within the page again we would like to copy and paste from the

00:32.240 --> 00:37.130
about or numbers because they are just going to be shorter since again and we're going to reuse tons

00:37.130 --> 00:38.630
of things from there.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.910
And maybe let's delete the long text.

00:40.960 --> 00:45.410
We are not going to use it or we're not gonna need it in our case.

00:45.440 --> 00:51.590
So once that is deleted we can also change the heading One AND LET'S WRITE.

00:51.590 --> 00:52.870
Contact us.

00:53.420 --> 00:59.420
Going to be our heading and within a little browser window and just navigate the contact page.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.380
And this is gonna be our page.

01:01.490 --> 01:05.470
Now before we start working on a form maybe let's also change the title.

01:05.570 --> 01:06.950
There should be contact.

01:07.250 --> 01:09.980
And now here are on the top of the tab.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.560
I have my title of the page.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.590
Now what we have for the forum.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.720
Well we have the heading One right.

01:17.030 --> 01:21.520
And then we would need to create the form element or element.

01:21.780 --> 01:26.280
And we can use the element obviously for this and we can just leave the action blank.

01:26.310 --> 01:32.840
Again we're not going to be collecting the values as well as let's start with the simple comment just

01:32.840 --> 01:35.830
to separate later on what we're going to be creating.

01:35.910 --> 01:39.600
This is going to be the name we need to use the label element.

01:39.680 --> 01:46.420
Now the label element will have the four attribute and this is gonna point to the idea that we're gonna

01:46.430 --> 01:53.300
be creating now in our case the idea we're going to have to be name mostly for the label to match as

01:53.300 --> 01:57.040
well as let's write input with a type of text.

01:57.050 --> 02:02.570
I also would like to add name attribute and we're gonna set the name attribute equal to the name in

02:02.570 --> 02:03.500
this case.

02:03.500 --> 02:09.590
And last but not least we have the 80 and the idea needs to match for attributes in the label.

02:09.590 --> 02:10.350
So in this case.

02:10.360 --> 02:16.910
Well then also a name with name and now I have excellent input where if I'm gonna click on the label

02:17.330 --> 02:19.490
the input is gonna be highlighted.

02:19.490 --> 02:25.850
So this is gonna be my name and again the reason for the comment is just making a separation later on

02:26.080 --> 02:29.660
it since this is gonna be the name but the next one is gonna be e-mail.

02:29.780 --> 02:35.740
So I'm gonna change the comment through email and now we're gonna change name in a few places.

02:35.930 --> 02:41.180
Since we don't want to keep the name but in fact this is gonna be email server so we're gonna be deleting

02:41.180 --> 02:44.900
it from the floor as well as the name on the label.

02:44.900 --> 02:48.870
The I.D. And last but not least the name attribute.

02:49.080 --> 02:55.580
So I can just delete all of them at the same time and let's write your email as long as email.

02:55.580 --> 02:56.780
Now we could have written.

02:56.780 --> 03:02.290
Same way how we did it deletion but since this is capital I just kind of rewrote it.

03:02.900 --> 03:05.730
All of them one at the same time.

03:05.730 --> 03:11.890
Now we have everything we have for attribute name I.D. email once we're gonna save it.

03:11.960 --> 03:18.840
We're gonna have our e-mail now maybe we can also add the Lindberg This is gonna look a little bit better

03:19.240 --> 03:27.180
and just get the actual line work as well as yeah maybe another one that might look a little bit more

03:27.180 --> 03:29.640
decent if we have two lines in between.

03:29.640 --> 03:30.750
And what else we have.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.740
Well we can also use the text area for a description.

03:35.190 --> 03:42.050
So let me copy this and now I have two line breaks as well here and here I'm gonna say that there's

03:42.060 --> 03:48.880
going to be a comment in the description and this wouldn't be the common form and description and let's

03:48.880 --> 03:52.280
write personal paragraph the corruption.

03:52.510 --> 03:59.280
So this would be my paragraph basically the value within the paragraph is gonna be description and we

03:59.280 --> 04:02.580
know that we have the text area right.

04:02.860 --> 04:06.030
We have a text area element now within the text area.

04:06.360 --> 04:09.540
Let's also write a name for description.

04:09.540 --> 04:14.600
Now as you can see in this case we're not using the label so we don't really care about Daddy.

04:14.730 --> 04:16.140
It can stay there blank.

04:16.170 --> 04:17.690
It doesn't really matter.

04:17.700 --> 04:24.060
Columns are gonna stay 30 rows are gonna say 10 and you know what let's write just a placeholder let's

04:24.060 --> 04:28.870
say for the place holder we're gonna say your description.

04:29.040 --> 04:36.030
This is something we should write and now we have a nice text area with a place holder of description.

04:36.310 --> 04:40.450
And yeah I think that's gonna be enough for our contact page.

04:40.480 --> 04:45.020
Let me just double check whether everything is working in the bigger browser window.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.760
We'll have the numbers from the numbers we can navigate in the contact.

04:48.820 --> 04:54.070
This is where we'll have our simple form and I think that everything is working fine.

04:54.070 --> 04:56.950
And we have successfully created all our four pages.
