00:00.780 --> 00:04.390
Up until now all our examples with links were with text.

00:04.710 --> 00:10.440
So we had some kind of link and then we placed the text within the link and then I slid the link was

00:10.440 --> 00:12.940
displayed and we were navigating somewhere.

00:13.230 --> 00:17.930
However we also have option for placing different things within the link.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.390
So we're just not limited to the text.

00:20.640 --> 00:21.980
So let's test it out.

00:22.170 --> 00:26.970
So let's say here on top of the page and again this is just so we can see a little bit clearer.

00:26.970 --> 00:28.270
Let's place a link.

00:28.500 --> 00:32.690
And for now let's say the link is going to be and I'm not going to the same thing.

00:32.690 --> 00:36.890
Maybe you get me the outcome again just to save me a little bit of time.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.210
Just grab this text.

00:38.220 --> 00:43.830
You can obviously write it if you want but I'm to copy and paste it and instead of placing the text

00:44.110 --> 00:49.170
of you Demi or John Doe whatever we would like to place there we can place an image.

00:49.290 --> 00:54.210
So let's say here we're gonna have the image we know that we need to have the image element within the

00:54.330 --> 00:56.370
image element within our source.

00:56.370 --> 01:02.140
Now in this case let's look for the images now within the images folder we also have an option for laptop.

01:02.610 --> 01:05.040
So I'm just gonna grab this image and you know what.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.260
Just so it looks a little bit better.

01:07.290 --> 01:07.970
Again let's uh.

01:08.010 --> 01:10.250
Maybe a width of 200.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.080
So it's gonna be a little bit smaller.

01:12.120 --> 01:16.020
I'm gonna skip on alternative attribute and let's see what's gonna happen.

01:17.170 --> 01:19.630
So as you can see right now I have the image.

01:19.630 --> 01:24.100
The difference though is as I'm scrolling or I'm sorry as I'm hovering over the image.

01:24.100 --> 01:24.760
Check this out.

01:25.390 --> 01:29.890
So I have this little like on that tells me that pretty much this is the link.

01:30.100 --> 01:34.330
Now as I'm hovering over the you dummy image things like that don't happen.

01:34.960 --> 01:38.850
So what this means is that this is actually a link right now.

01:38.950 --> 01:43.630
So if I click on it sure enough navigating through a dummy page.

01:43.640 --> 01:48.600
Now last but not least now that we know that we can also place in images within the link.

01:48.610 --> 01:50.350
We're not limited to the text.

01:50.350 --> 01:51.540
I also want to show you that.

01:51.550 --> 01:57.370
Let's say if you don't know right now this point where your link should be navigating.

01:57.370 --> 01:59.590
Let's say you know that there's gonna be a link on the page.

02:00.100 --> 02:03.250
However you don't know right now the URL.

02:03.340 --> 02:06.140
Well we can always do we can just place a hashtag.

02:06.170 --> 02:08.550
And that way we can be having a link.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.490
So it's gonna be a link.

02:09.500 --> 02:14.650
It's gonna be displayed as a link and it's gonna be clickable and everything but it's not going to navigate

02:14.650 --> 02:15.060
anywhere.

02:15.460 --> 02:17.040
So that's also an option.

02:17.050 --> 02:20.490
I mean again you can call this or you'd like it could be an empty link.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.640
This could be a dummy link.

02:21.640 --> 02:22.890
It doesn't really matter.

02:22.900 --> 02:28.690
The main point is instead of placing you URL within the entries we're just placing a hashtag.
