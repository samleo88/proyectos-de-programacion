1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,680
Alright guys, what we're going to do is

2

00:00:01,680  -->  00:00:04,650
actually modify the set tab text method,

3

00:00:04,650  -->  00:00:08,639
so we can also set the icon at the same

4

00:00:08,639  -->  00:00:11,880
time. So what we're going to do is we're going

5

00:00:11,880  -->  00:00:13,830
to pass through another parameter here

6

00:00:13,830  -->  00:00:16,890
and it's going to be a type, so this is

7

00:00:16,890  -->  00:00:20,100
going to be title, and then we're also

8

00:00:20,100  -->  00:00:22,529
going to send it through as icon for when icon

9

00:00:22,529  -->  00:00:32,399
changes. So, self.tabs[i].content.icon

10

00:00:32,399  -->  00:00:37,739
Changed.connect, I'm going to open it with

11

00:00:37,739  -->  00:00:41,370
lambda and say self.SetTabContent.

12

00:00:41,370  -->  00:00:50,190
Change this as well, and we're going to send it

13

00:00:50,190  -->  00:00:53,280
through with the index number, and this

14

00:00:53,280  -->  00:00:57,270
is going to be called icon. So, we are

15

00:00:57,270  -->  00:00:59,129
going to add some conditionals to this

16

00:00:59,129  -->  00:01:01,890
method here to basically determine if

17

00:01:01,890  -->  00:01:03,780
it's title or icon, because most of the

18

00:01:03,780  -->  00:01:06,150
functionality of those two changes are

19

00:01:06,150  -->  00:01:09,720
the same. So let's also pass through

20

00:01:09,720  -->  00:01:20,280
types. So, if type equals title, and we

21

00:01:20,280  -->  00:01:22,950
also need to update the method name to

22

00:01:22,950  -->  00:01:27,270
content so it's now set tab content, so

23

00:01:27,270  -->  00:01:31,710
if type equals title do that.

24

00:01:31,710  -->  00:01:40,229
elif type equals "icon": set newIcon

25

00:01:40,229  -->  00:01:51,149
equal to self.findChild(QWidget,

26

00:01:51,149  -->  00:01:59,579
tab_name).content.icon, and then

27

00:01:59,579  -->  00:02:01,860
we're going to just update the icon in the same way.

28

00:02:01,860  -->  00:02:04,950
So the tab bar has icons that you can

29

00:02:04,950  -->  00:02:08,319
set, so setTabIcon.

30

00:02:08,319  -->  00:02:15,639
The index is going to be a count, and

31

00:02:15,639  -->  00:02:17,889
then the new icon that we are going to set is

32

00:02:17,889  -->  00:02:22,540
newIcon, and it's in a QIcon format.

33

00:02:22,540  -->  00:02:25,120
And then regardless of which type it was

34

00:02:25,120  -->  00:02:30,280
we set running to false. Save this, run the

35

00:02:30,280  -->  00:02:34,419
app again, and we should get an icon

36

00:02:34,419  -->  00:02:36,939
there, and we do. And this should also

37

00:02:36,939  -->  00:02:42,519
work when we go to Facebook, it should load up

38

00:02:42,519  -->  00:02:45,760
Facebook's icon, put it in the correct tab, and

39

00:02:45,760  -->  00:02:49,299
it does. So, that's what we want to do

40

00:02:49,299  -->  00:02:53,709
here and we also want to remove some of

41

00:02:53,709  -->  00:02:57,699
that space. So let's go up here, and I

42

00:02:57,699  -->  00:02:59,379
believe it's in the tabs

43

00:02:59,379  -->  00:03:05,260
virtualbox layout. So let me go ahead and set self.

44

00:03:05,260  -->  00:03:12,069
tabs[i].layout.setContents

45

00:03:12,069  -->  00:03:16,239
Margins, and 1, 2, 3, 4 and

46

00:03:16,239  -->  00:03:19,060
there's four zeros for west, north, east, and

47

00:03:19,060  -->  00:03:26,259
south. That looks a bit better. I need to

48

00:03:26,259  -->  00:03:30,519
find out why it's jumping there, I think

49

00:03:30,519  -->  00:03:33,569
it's because up here...

50

00:03:38,980  -->  00:03:44,280
let's move that,

51

00:03:48,280  -->  00:03:54,850
open up a new tab...I don't know why that

52

00:03:54,850  -->  00:03:58,180
set based size would make it jump

53

00:03:58,180  -->  00:04:03,880
on Mac OS because it doesn't do the same

54

00:04:03,880  -->  00:04:07,989
thing on on Windows. So, I'm really not sure,

55

00:04:07,989  -->  00:04:09,459
but what we're going to do is set

56

00:04:09,459  -->  00:04:11,440
minimum size there so that it can only

57

00:04:11,440  -->  00:04:16,720
be a minimum size of say 1366.

58

00:04:16,720  -->  00:04:24,669
So self.setMinimumSize, it's going to be 1366 x 768, and

59

00:04:24,669  -->  00:04:28,750
then let's go ahead and open it. Does it

60

00:04:28,750  -->  00:04:30,190
jump around?

61

00:04:30,190  -->  00:04:36,760
No, everything looks like it's working. So now

62

00:04:36,760  -->  00:04:38,980
I'm going to set the base size,

63

00:04:38,980  -->  00:04:42,010
maybe it was just both of those weren't

64

00:04:42,010  -->  00:04:48,880
set, so hopefully this sets it correctly.

65

00:04:48,880  -->  00:04:52,330
There, looks better.

66

00:04:52,330  -->  00:04:54,280
Alright, so, what we're also going to do

67

00:04:54,280  -->  00:04:55,810
here we're going to clean up one other

68

00:04:55,810  -->  00:04:58,419
thing, and that's just the tab bar

69

00:04:58,419  -->  00:05:06,630
here. Alright...

70

00:05:08,790  -->  00:05:15,870
so we also have to do some more checks there.

71

00:05:15,870  -->  00:05:19,350
Basically, when we added this call

72

00:05:19,350  -->  00:05:23,820
right here we would check that, rather

73

00:05:23,820  -->  00:05:24,960
than just getting the tab. We were

74

00:05:24,960  -->  00:05:26,520
actually getting something else

75

00:05:26,520  -->  00:05:30,090
further, and so what it's doing is when

76

00:05:30,090  -->  00:05:32,670
you click on the tab bar anywhere

77

00:05:32,670  -->  00:05:39,000
you know it switched tabs. So, what we're

78

00:05:39,000  -->  00:05:41,820
going to do is you can set draw base, so

79

00:05:41,820  -->  00:05:45,420
self.tabbar.setDrawBase, and

80

00:05:45,420  -->  00:05:47,370
we're going to set that to false, and that's

81

00:05:47,370  -->  00:05:49,650
going to not draw that little

82

00:05:49,650  -->  00:05:55,980
area right here. And so that's all

83

00:05:55,980  -->  00:05:58,200
we're going to do right now. In the next

84

00:05:58,200  -->  00:06:00,510
video we're going to be adding some more

85

00:06:00,510  -->  00:06:04,340
webview functionality.
