WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:07.590
And lastly why don't we set up our buttons for each and every card there is going to be button that

00:07.650 --> 00:14.340
initially is going to sit in the bottom of our image container and then we're gonna use a transform

00:14.340 --> 00:22.200
property in fact move it 50 percent off its height so it's sitting exactly in the middle of the image

00:22.200 --> 00:24.150
container bottom border.

00:24.150 --> 00:24.440
Okay.

00:24.990 --> 00:26.550
Now one by one.

00:26.580 --> 00:33.660
First of all I guess we're gonna have to head over back again to a services and for each and every service

00:34.080 --> 00:38.670
we're going to add our service icon essentially our font awesome.

00:38.700 --> 00:43.820
Now remember we did something very very similar for skills.

00:43.860 --> 00:46.600
So again I'm gonna use my finder.

00:46.600 --> 00:52.320
We're gonna head over to the skills and the skills that we're looking for is this particular skills

00:52.320 --> 00:53.500
icon.

00:54.030 --> 00:58.020
So instead of skills course we're gonna name it services.

00:58.290 --> 00:59.930
So it's really up to you.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.380
You can create a new span with a services.

01:03.390 --> 01:07.700
In fact class and then as well add your icons.

01:07.800 --> 01:12.660
In my case I'm just gonna grab this particular one I'm going to copy it.

01:12.720 --> 01:20.670
Then again Let's navigate to services services and then within the services let's find whereas our image

01:20.670 --> 01:21.740
container.

01:22.110 --> 01:23.810
So that's my first card.

01:23.940 --> 01:29.330
And then remember we had the image container and then also we had the service icon.

01:29.330 --> 01:29.920
All right.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.880
Now this is the case where I would like to copy paste it instead of skill icon.

01:34.920 --> 01:43.290
We're gonna call this service icon and for the first one there's gonna be a different icon so I'm gonna

01:43.290 --> 01:48.510
go with mortar Besler or something like that.

01:48.510 --> 01:52.800
I mean I obviously missed pronounced it that I think we can live with that.

01:53.310 --> 01:57.060
So here it's going to be our icon.

01:57.100 --> 02:01.620
Let me refresh and then yeah there it is.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.500
Now of course it doesn't look like much.

02:03.530 --> 02:07.920
There is plenty of work that needs to be done but at least we do have our icon.

02:07.980 --> 02:09.660
So that's step number one.

02:09.660 --> 02:15.720
Now once we have our service icon in fact I'm gonna grab it again like so.

02:15.720 --> 02:22.490
And I think we just need to span because I think for the rest of them we do still have the icon comment

02:22.610 --> 02:25.940
OK let's copy and paste it for the second one.

02:25.950 --> 02:28.440
We're going to go with a home one.

02:28.450 --> 02:35.310
Ok I'm gonna say f a home and there's one thing that I would like to add one more class for my icons

02:35.760 --> 02:40.060
and the icon is f a f w.

02:40.090 --> 02:46.950
Now this particular class in fact makes sure that if they're sitting side by side in fact they all have

02:46.950 --> 02:48.280
the same with.

02:48.630 --> 02:56.280
So since we're gonna add this rounded border as well as the rounder with meaning we're gonna use the

02:56.310 --> 03:05.000
border radius in fact set it to 50 percent so that way we're gonna have this effect of rounded icon.

03:05.100 --> 03:12.660
Well that's the reason why we're gonna add DFA F W because that way we're gonna make sure that all the

03:12.660 --> 03:16.180
icons in fact are displayed exactly the same way.

03:16.620 --> 03:23.360
So let's head over back to our first one and also add this class and this is just coming from font some

03:23.640 --> 03:29.270
documentation and this is not something that I came up with but it's in fact written there.

03:29.280 --> 03:36.090
So let's again select last span and then add over again back to service icon.

03:36.360 --> 03:39.390
And my last icon is going to be this hot mug.

03:39.820 --> 03:45.770
OK so let's write hot mug and then save it.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.020
And if we're gonna have our icon which we don't.

03:49.020 --> 03:53.990
So maybe it was mug hot Mark Hart maybe that's going to work.

03:54.010 --> 03:58.270
And yes I do have my mark right now I do have my icons.

03:58.390 --> 04:02.190
So my issue the amount is in fact done.

04:02.350 --> 04:04.930
We are done with our email.

04:05.020 --> 04:08.930
But then let's head over again back to our services.

04:09.070 --> 04:15.610
And then before we end the services we're going to set up in fact our class war service icon.

04:16.150 --> 04:24.040
So remember the class name it was the service icon and first and foremost when you decide well how are

04:24.040 --> 04:25.940
you going to do our layout.

04:26.140 --> 04:30.320
Because our main goal is following we do have our image container.

04:30.370 --> 04:36.130
And then within the image container we have our image and then also we would like to place the icon

04:36.520 --> 04:38.700
all the way in the bottom right.

04:38.710 --> 04:44.380
And then we're going to use the transform property in fact to move it even lower.

04:44.380 --> 04:44.940
All right.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.980
So if we have position absolute remember that one.

04:49.020 --> 04:49.300
Right.

04:49.300 --> 04:53.050
So we had options for accessing the position absolute.

04:53.060 --> 04:59.560
One using position absolute we need to have some kind of parent container that has position relative

05:00.070 --> 05:05.560
because we would like to place this icon in fact relative to something and we would like to place it

05:05.860 --> 05:14.740
relative in fact to the image container so we can of course head over back here and add for the service

05:14.890 --> 05:16.070
in which container.

05:16.180 --> 05:18.730
Remember we had in fact our class.

05:18.730 --> 05:19.120
Correct.

05:19.450 --> 05:26.140
So for each and every day if that was the parent for the image and the icon we had also class of service

05:26.170 --> 05:27.400
image container.

05:27.430 --> 05:34.090
So if prior to that we had styles already added there of course we would head over back there and add

05:34.300 --> 05:41.040
the style of position relative to that particular class or in this case we haven't add any kind of styles.

05:41.170 --> 05:49.870
So I can just write here above the surface icon service image container and then for this particular

05:49.870 --> 05:53.590
container I'm going to set it as a position relative.

05:53.980 --> 06:01.360
So now when I'm going to set my service icon with position absolute Well it's in fact in a reference

06:01.660 --> 06:03.120
the image container.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.430
OK so let's go with position absolute.

06:06.310 --> 06:08.960
And first let's place it in the bottom line.

06:09.160 --> 06:15.600
Let's say bottom is going to be 50 percent or you know what knowledge just go with zero.

06:15.640 --> 06:20.860
So that's going to sit all the way in the bottom as you can see right now and then let's go with 50

06:20.860 --> 06:25.280
percent left like so and now we have our icon.

06:25.510 --> 06:31.120
Then let's add more styles and eventually like I said we're gonna have to use the transform property

06:31.420 --> 06:33.670
to even move it more.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.850
So let's go with font size.

06:37.350 --> 06:44.050
We're gonna set it as two arms as you can see it is bigger than we also can maybe add some background

06:44.050 --> 06:44.890
here.

06:44.890 --> 06:49.720
The background is going to be secondary color which in fact is my yellow color.

06:49.870 --> 06:56.040
So let's write secondary color like so I do have my background that's working out really well.

06:56.150 --> 07:02.950
And then let's add a little bit of padding so zero point twenty five our hems top bottom zero point

07:02.950 --> 07:04.540
six are am left and right.

07:04.540 --> 07:09.950
And again these values are really up to you if you want more padding if you want different colors.

07:10.000 --> 07:10.720
Go ahead.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.310
You can do it however you'd like.

07:12.310 --> 07:12.960
All right.

07:12.960 --> 07:18.530
And then like I said I would want to make right now my span my service icon in fact around.

07:18.800 --> 07:19.480
Okay.

07:19.570 --> 07:25.300
And the way we do that is in fact by using border radius like so.

07:25.300 --> 07:28.130
And then we just set it up as 50 percent.

07:28.150 --> 07:28.850
All right.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.990
Now we have our icon has around it.

07:32.180 --> 07:32.650
OK.

07:32.770 --> 07:39.390
Now remember again we have the span that is in fact has the padding as well as this border radius of

07:39.400 --> 07:40.450
50 percent.

07:40.450 --> 07:44.020
And then within that span that's when we have our icon.

07:44.020 --> 07:44.830
All right.

07:44.830 --> 07:50.970
Now also what we would like to do is set up the border so let's go with border.

07:51.100 --> 07:56.410
And in this case I would like to have the same border as I have for my background because I would like

07:56.410 --> 08:02.590
to have in fact this layout where I do have my image container and then there's border is in fact that

08:02.950 --> 08:08.620
right now currently for my services info is in fact continuing here.

08:08.630 --> 08:08.990
Right.

08:09.070 --> 08:11.140
That's the layout that I'm shooting for.

08:11.140 --> 08:14.350
So the way we do that is by setting a border.

08:14.350 --> 08:17.330
Again the width is up to you.

08:17.440 --> 08:23.170
I'm going to go with you our yams solid and let's add our primary color.

08:23.520 --> 08:26.230
So let's add primary color.

08:26.300 --> 08:27.850
That's my border.

08:27.850 --> 08:29.980
And that works out really well.

08:29.980 --> 08:31.660
And then what else we have.

08:31.660 --> 08:34.970
Well then we would like to in fact add a color.

08:35.440 --> 08:35.740
All right.

08:35.770 --> 08:43.640
So I'm going to go with color and we're going to go with main dark var main dark white.

08:43.690 --> 08:48.670
So we added the color and then we have the border we have the color.

08:48.670 --> 08:51.920
Why don't we in fact move our icon down.

08:52.280 --> 08:52.910
OK.

08:53.030 --> 08:54.320
That's currently what happens.

08:54.380 --> 08:58.040
Well it is sitting in the bottom of our image container correct.

08:58.190 --> 09:04.280
But you are noticing one thing where it is not sitting actually exactly in the middle.

09:04.350 --> 09:09.030
OK because the actual icon has its own width and height.

09:09.110 --> 09:15.350
So we would like to use the transform property so transform property and therefore transform property

09:15.350 --> 09:17.410
we can use a translate function.

09:17.550 --> 09:23.540
Now within the translate function we can either translate left and right or we can translate it up and

09:23.540 --> 09:23.840
down.

09:24.140 --> 09:26.850
So the first value is going to be the x axis.

09:26.930 --> 09:28.030
So left and right.

09:28.040 --> 09:36.290
So if I'm gonna write minus 50 percent or negative 50 percent what that means is that we're going to

09:36.290 --> 09:42.700
move our icon 50 percent of its own width and height to the left.

09:43.180 --> 09:50.270
Okay I'm sorry with I guess in this case not width and height as you see we moved it 50 percent so now

09:50.270 --> 09:56.620
it is sitting exactly in the center as previously we had already some kind of with on wrong.

09:56.660 --> 09:59.120
Now we moved it 50 percent to the left.

09:59.240 --> 10:04.510
And second I would like to move with 50 percent off its height also done.

10:04.700 --> 10:10.850
So that's going to be our layout where we have the image container and our icon is going to sit exactly

10:10.850 --> 10:17.330
in the middle of the bottom quarter right now if we're gonna go with negative 50 percent well we're

10:17.330 --> 10:19.090
going to move our icon up.

10:19.390 --> 10:19.570
Okay.

10:19.650 --> 10:23.510
And that's not what we want our like to even move it down.

10:23.540 --> 10:29.870
So if we're going to move 50 percent right now our icon is sitting exactly in the center.

10:29.870 --> 10:35.330
Now there's one thing though where I would like to add in fact some kind of box shadow or something

10:35.330 --> 10:39.990
like that for my icon because as you can see it's kind of hard to see here.

10:40.130 --> 10:41.460
The borer in the bottom.

10:41.570 --> 10:45.290
Now if you'd like to course you can leave it and leave it like this.

10:45.290 --> 10:52.130
You don't have to add in fact the border or I'm sorry box shadow properties but I'm going to do that

10:52.520 --> 10:59.750
now I could add it manually myself but I always find it actually the fastest way this way where I have

10:59.750 --> 11:01.770
box shut our generator.

11:01.800 --> 11:02.230
OK.

11:02.330 --> 11:06.500
So we look for this particular website and we write or we have our values.

11:06.500 --> 11:10.090
Now here this is just simply click and change the values.

11:10.220 --> 11:16.180
So let's say if you don't like this particular value you can change it here with these nice buttons.

11:16.190 --> 11:16.430
Right.

11:16.430 --> 11:20.180
So we just keep on clicking on whatever we would like.

11:20.180 --> 11:24.860
So we have horizontal length than we have of course vertical block radius.

11:24.860 --> 11:30.350
Then also we have spread and we can change the color how we would like but since I would like to keep

11:30.350 --> 11:34.040
it simple I'm just going to grab these codes and you can right away see that.

11:34.100 --> 11:36.690
You also have your perfect sir setup.

11:36.690 --> 11:39.720
All right so technically you don't have to do it yourself.

11:39.770 --> 11:49.170
So let me select this one and let's head over back here and let's just add a comment of box shadow like

11:49.200 --> 11:52.920
so let's copy paste it and we should have the box shut up again.

11:53.010 --> 11:57.960
If you don't like my box shut of course change these values and just grab this code.

11:57.960 --> 11:58.450
All right.

11:58.650 --> 12:03.820
So you're going to have these range inputs where you can change these values and let's change that.

12:03.840 --> 12:09.540
Now lastly remember when we were working with the service card I also mentioned that there's going to

12:09.540 --> 12:11.910
be some styles for a buck shadow.

12:11.910 --> 12:18.570
So my plan was very simple where the actual card itself has some dark shadow and as I'm hovering I'm

12:18.570 --> 12:20.190
just adding this Berkshire.

12:20.580 --> 12:21.210
OK.

12:21.300 --> 12:29.040
Now the way I did that I just went half with not five pixels arms are 10 pixels I went with let's say

12:29.040 --> 12:32.050
five and five and Blur was two.

12:32.410 --> 12:40.630
Like so then let's grab these three lines of code for the service card let's just copy and paste it.

12:40.760 --> 12:46.540
Now what happens also is I would want that effect to take place over time.

12:46.760 --> 12:50.540
So I would want to happen that instantly.

12:50.570 --> 12:56.620
So the way we do that is in fact again we set up a transform property or I'm sorry transition right.

12:56.630 --> 13:05.540
So transition property and we were just shooting for our variable of VAR and I believe it was made transition.

13:05.540 --> 13:08.390
So now the change happens over time.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.160
So right away we did have our shadow.

13:11.240 --> 13:20.480
But if we're going to add in fact a hover effect so let's write service card however so as we're hovering

13:20.480 --> 13:23.060
over the card I would like to change it.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.940
All right now I'm not going to add right now right away.

13:25.940 --> 13:28.270
All these values are you know what I could probably.

13:28.270 --> 13:31.620
Sorry I'm probably going to go with I don't know.

13:31.730 --> 13:37.520
Back to 10 not hundred but let's say 10 as well as the Blur ideas.

13:37.580 --> 13:38.630
Gonna be fine.

13:38.630 --> 13:41.810
Now again I'm not going to waste your time by changing colors.

13:41.810 --> 13:43.760
I'm just gonna grab these three values.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.680
All right let's copy and paste that.

13:46.100 --> 13:49.130
And now what happens as we're hovering over the card.

13:49.130 --> 13:52.020
In fact we are increasing the box shadow.

13:52.450 --> 13:55.100
Now we do that with using the hover effect.

13:55.100 --> 14:01.410
And the fact that we do have our transition property where we can set up change over time.

14:01.400 --> 14:01.670
All right.

14:02.150 --> 14:08.950
And successful guys we created our services section where we are implementing the card layout.

14:09.410 --> 14:10.810
So we have three cards.

14:10.910 --> 14:14.990
And then depending on the screen size we change the number of columns.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.650
So on a bigger screen we have three columns on a smaller one.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.470
Two columns and then an extra small screen.

14:21.500 --> 14:28.820
We have a one column layout and then also we took a look at the fact how we can set up in fact the and

14:29.020 --> 14:32.450
position absolute where we had our image container.

14:32.690 --> 14:39.240
And we just placed our icon all the way in the bottom of image container used transform property.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.890
