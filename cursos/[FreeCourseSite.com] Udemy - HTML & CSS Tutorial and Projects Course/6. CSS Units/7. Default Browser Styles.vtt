00:00.510 --> 00:05.910
At this point I have mentioned default browser styles far too many times without going into too much

00:05.910 --> 00:06.740
detail.

00:06.900 --> 00:12.690
So why don't we change that and see what default browser styles are all about as well as getting our

00:12.690 --> 00:20.510
feet wet with Google dev tools which is an awesome tool to test and examine and to debug our code.

00:20.610 --> 00:26.820
Now first things first I would like to get rid of the content in the stuff success so it can just delete

00:26.850 --> 00:28.170
these seconds here.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.500
We can save it.

00:29.500 --> 00:34.510
We can also head over to indexation email and get rid of both of these Divs.

00:34.530 --> 00:43.350
Now let's write just a simple heading one that would say default browser styles or something like this.

00:43.350 --> 00:49.040
And once we have our having one with some generic text now let us decide what we're gonna do.

00:49.140 --> 00:52.320
Well we would like to see where our default browser styles.

00:52.500 --> 00:57.930
We can do this on a side browser window here on a small one but I'm gonna do it on a bigger browser

00:57.930 --> 01:03.510
window because I think it's gonna be easier for us to see and in order to see default browsers as an

01:03.510 --> 01:10.200
action we would need to head over to our dev tools to the Google dovetails now in order to do that we

01:10.200 --> 01:16.380
would need to either use the right click and notice we would have to come to inspect or we can go the

01:16.380 --> 01:21.780
longer out where we are right clicking or I'm sorry just clicking on this little icon then we're looking

01:21.780 --> 01:27.270
for more tools and within the more tools we have the dev tools and nor is they even give you the shortcut

01:27.300 --> 01:27.660
for that.

01:28.080 --> 01:33.480
So again doesn't really matter which option you choose as long as you get to this window.

01:33.480 --> 01:37.170
Now I know this might look a little bit scary in the beginning.

01:37.170 --> 01:40.820
I trust you and I really feel your pain.

01:40.890 --> 01:46.110
However please don't be scared of this especially right now because we're not gonna be covering all

01:46.110 --> 01:47.760
these tabs or anything like that.

01:47.910 --> 01:50.720
We're not working with JavaScript so we don't need a console.

01:50.790 --> 01:54.070
We're not going to be working with redux or we don't care about.

01:54.360 --> 01:57.630
What we will gonna be working is the elements and you know what.

01:57.630 --> 02:02.760
Let me just zoom in a little bit because I think that way we're going to be able to see everything better.

02:02.810 --> 02:03.220
Okay.

02:03.300 --> 02:04.050
So far so good.

02:04.050 --> 02:05.660
So we have our element.

02:05.880 --> 02:09.780
Now what do you see here in this pain or screen or how are you call it.

02:10.260 --> 02:14.160
What do you see here has the text or has the content.

02:14.160 --> 02:19.320
Well if we're looking correctly we see the doctor so that I already should bring us the bell.

02:19.470 --> 02:24.780
Then we also see the heading One hand unless I'm half asleep right now.

02:24.780 --> 02:27.900
I think this is our heading one not medical check.

02:28.340 --> 02:29.240
I think it is yes.

02:29.240 --> 02:33.720
So we have the heading One and that actually matches that we have in our duck.

02:34.440 --> 02:40.260
So basically what we see or hear are the elements that are going to be in our document.

02:40.260 --> 02:44.960
So everything that we have in a document we also see here on this screen.

02:45.060 --> 02:50.520
Now I can open this up and notice we have the head element obviously we have the Met attacks as well

02:50.520 --> 02:51.470
as we have the link.

02:51.720 --> 02:58.200
So so far so good as well as we have the actual body now within the body is where we have our heading

02:58.200 --> 02:59.540
one.

02:59.730 --> 03:00.480
So far so good.

03:00.870 --> 03:05.210
So if I'm going to click here on this heading one what do you see here on the right hand side.

03:06.110 --> 03:11.870
Well we see that there is going to be syntax that we already have covered it quite a lot of times which

03:11.870 --> 03:15.780
is the assistant next we have the currently braces and then we have to stop.

03:16.590 --> 03:21.310
But what about the stylus display block that doesn't ring a bell.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.530
We didn't write that font size.

03:23.540 --> 03:27.280
Well we know the property but I don't think we included knock.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.290
Well maybe I'm wrong.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.360
Let's head over back to style is this.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.630
Make sure that I did have my coffee.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.070
Know we did not have any of these styles.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.460
No I'd see the clean style sheet.

03:37.490 --> 03:42.320
There's nothing here as well as everything you say so it's not like we added them and maybe it didn't

03:42.320 --> 03:43.970
save them or something like that.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.560
So what's happening here.

03:45.560 --> 03:52.700
Well you see for every browser in or just the display heading one more any kind of Asian email it needs

03:52.700 --> 03:54.340
to have some default browser stuff.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.880
Otherwise think about it.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.630
So I'm gonna write something.

03:57.800 --> 04:01.880
We will then need to have some type of C to display it right.

04:01.890 --> 04:04.700
Otherwise how we're going to displayed on the page.

04:04.700 --> 04:08.800
So we're going gonna write the heading One and then what is just gonna magically appear.

04:08.840 --> 04:12.650
So this is where the default browser styles are coming to play.

04:12.890 --> 04:16.130
Now again we see quite a few of them here.

04:16.130 --> 04:22.310
And one thing about them is that as you're gonna be heading through let's say your dev tools if ever

04:22.310 --> 04:24.670
you're going to notice this user agent style sheet.

04:24.810 --> 04:27.990
That means that that comes from default browser stuff.

04:28.100 --> 04:32.540
Now there's gonna be cases where we're all going to override them just like we did in a previous video

04:32.840 --> 04:34.790
where I used some preset.

04:34.790 --> 04:37.830
So I got rid of some margins that come by default.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.180
Now in most cases rose is gonna use them.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.780
So that's the thing if we're using let's say heading one.

04:43.010 --> 04:45.780
So we're gonna have by default font size.

04:45.830 --> 04:46.590
Ms.

04:46.730 --> 04:51.920
Now unless you override this in your sisters you're just gonna use that you're just gonna assume that

04:52.250 --> 04:55.940
all the heading ones that you're going to have are are gonna have this kind of contact.

04:56.450 --> 04:57.830
So that's all there is to it.

04:58.250 --> 05:03.300
So it comes with some default browser size some of them you might overwrite it some of them we want

05:03.350 --> 05:08.660
some of them you're just can use it like for example again let's say font weight ball unless you override

05:08.660 --> 05:12.220
this for your heading ones then they are just gonna be bold.

05:12.230 --> 05:13.460
Now let's test something out.

05:13.900 --> 05:17.810
I'm gonna head over back to index and shame Schimmel and we're gonna say that you know what.

05:17.870 --> 05:23.330
Not only there's going to be hitting one with different browser styles let's create a hearing tool in

05:23.390 --> 05:34.360
heading to we're gonna say Google Google the chrome let's let's use chrome chrome dev tools something

05:34.360 --> 05:37.330
like this are awesome.

05:37.340 --> 05:43.420
Let's read this over here and heading to but in this case we're going to head over to ELC users and

05:43.420 --> 05:45.390
actually add some styles.

05:45.430 --> 05:50.530
Now what we're gonna add again going be very simple something we have done already before color is gonna

05:50.530 --> 05:51.460
be red.

05:51.460 --> 05:57.310
And let's say font size is gonna be I don't know what we can do maybe 60 pixels something like this

05:57.400 --> 06:02.150
again doesn't really matter what you write as long as you add some type of style.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.690
Again we're gonna head over back to our dev tools.

06:04.780 --> 06:06.400
Notice something interesting.

06:06.400 --> 06:13.090
So I have my heading one and if I would like to check any element as I'm hovering over the element then

06:13.440 --> 06:16.300
already dev tools are telling me some stuff about them.

06:16.330 --> 06:20.550
So from the body let's say chose over here to the width and height.

06:20.560 --> 06:25.520
So there's gonna be some width and height in the pixels as well as we have an option here.

06:25.660 --> 06:30.420
If let's say we click on them then on the right and it's being displayed.

06:30.660 --> 06:33.160
So if I click on them again it shows over here.

06:33.160 --> 06:37.720
If I click on any one as well this is being displayed on the right hand side.

06:37.720 --> 06:44.340
Now it's also nifty about Google dev tools is the fact that I can just select the element so have this

06:44.330 --> 06:46.590
option of just clicking on it on the Lara.

06:46.990 --> 06:51.010
And then as I'm hovering over the document I can just select wherever I want.

06:51.070 --> 06:55.690
Now that's gonna come in handy especially if you have something really nested which is going to happen

06:55.690 --> 06:58.240
later on as we're working with Project.

06:58.240 --> 07:03.610
Please understand that right now we have two elements so that's probably going to be no case in your

07:03.610 --> 07:04.510
scenario.

07:04.510 --> 07:08.250
Whenever you're working with anything that has to do with H name LCROSS.

07:08.620 --> 07:13.750
So again this is going to be very nifty later on for you whenever you can just point to whatever element

07:13.780 --> 07:18.700
you would like and notice it pretty much shows me that there going to be having one or two and I can

07:18.700 --> 07:19.400
just click on it.

07:19.480 --> 07:23.400
And again this is gonna show me on the right hand side what I have.

07:23.460 --> 07:27.640
You notice something interesting and I can you know what I can actually maybe make this a little bit

07:27.640 --> 07:28.390
bigger.

07:28.450 --> 07:34.900
I have the heading to but in this case not only I have the default styles that I'm getting again from

07:34.900 --> 07:35.710
the browser.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.280
I also have our own stuff.

07:37.940 --> 07:40.300
And here we see obviously the styles.

07:40.340 --> 07:42.640
Says now what is style CSX.

07:43.030 --> 07:47.840
Well the last time I checked it was actually our story our CSF stash.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.880
So this tells me where I'm getting these tasks from now.

07:51.970 --> 07:59.050
What's also really really nifty is the fact that we can test it in a browser now be aware though whatever

07:59.050 --> 08:04.330
we're gonna write here is not gonna stay in our actual success meaning the moment we're going to refresh

08:04.330 --> 08:06.580
the page all the changes are gonna go away.

08:06.610 --> 08:11.900
But what we can do in dev tools is we can test something out.

08:12.190 --> 08:18.490
So let's say I don't like the red color I thought I did but in fact I don't know what we can do.

08:18.530 --> 08:21.630
Well I can head over here I can click on it and you know what.

08:21.670 --> 08:22.590
Not red.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.930
Much less red blue I'm sure now this is blue.

08:25.930 --> 08:30.550
Now again the moment I'm gonna refresh the page it's gonna go back to the red because this is what we're

08:30.550 --> 08:36.280
getting from the style screen but we can change this in the browser and that way we can test it out

08:36.820 --> 08:42.730
now again for this kind of scenario two elements quite realistically you're probably not gonna be checking

08:42.730 --> 08:48.010
anything here you're gonna write everything in this process as your project grows bigger hill there's

08:48.010 --> 08:53.350
gonna be cases where you just want to hop over to dev tools quickly check something whether that makes

08:53.350 --> 08:58.460
sense or maybe you're gonna be debugging something you're gonna be checking for these default browsers

08:58.470 --> 09:03.270
now because what's gonna happen is there's going to be cases especially with layout.

09:03.340 --> 09:08.120
Trust me with layout you're gonna have a pain where you're going to be looking for something you're

09:08.170 --> 09:11.270
gonna be like Hey listen I added some margin some padding.

09:11.290 --> 09:13.820
And again these are things we haven't covered yet and we will.

09:13.960 --> 09:19.450
But I added this biting has added in margin what is happening why this is not working and this is where

09:19.450 --> 09:20.680
it's really help.

09:20.680 --> 09:23.140
Again at the moment scary.

09:23.140 --> 09:23.860
Gotcha.

09:23.860 --> 09:24.780
I understand.

09:24.880 --> 09:32.230
No problem but I would strongly encourage you to at least try to start using it in a sense.

09:32.230 --> 09:34.280
Just don't dismiss it and don't say okay.

09:34.290 --> 09:35.400
It looks scary right now.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.400
So I'm not gonna touch it.

09:36.400 --> 09:42.820
I don't ever want to know about them because they will gonna come really handy and as far as the default

09:42.820 --> 09:47.530
browser styles come and go then there's gonna be styles that we will gonna overwrite.

09:47.530 --> 09:51.280
Like I said and there's gonna be styles that we're just gonna use it and we're gonna be fine with.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.110
And that's the basic scenario.
