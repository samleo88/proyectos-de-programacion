WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:04.300
And in order to create a target model we're going to need a query.

00:04.380 --> 00:09.750
And actually we're going to need Jake very obviously for much more than toggle button for all the features

00:09.750 --> 00:14.910
like again like for example or hate this guy or he'll write this isotope right.

00:14.970 --> 00:17.210
We're also going to need a Jacquard right.

00:17.220 --> 00:20.840
So once we download it right and we're going to actually use a CDN.

00:20.850 --> 00:22.170
So it's not really a download.

00:22.170 --> 00:26.340
We just need to copy and paste the link but we're going to use it throughout the project.

00:26.610 --> 00:33.060
So I'm just going to go to Google Jake worry Google CDN libraries are doing this and they're going to

00:33.060 --> 00:38.710
go down here and I can see this is going to be my script that's always going to grab the script over

00:38.710 --> 00:43.800
here and I'm going to copy this and we're going to jump back to our document we're here and the first

00:43.800 --> 00:47.880
thing that I'm going to do I'm going to go all the way in the morning on here like this and I'm going

00:47.880 --> 00:54.850
to say that this is going to be a Jake where you're here and ochreous right CD and all this and then

00:54.870 --> 00:56.650
we're going to copy and paste this.

00:56.790 --> 00:57.170
Right.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.700
And now you can see that I have my Jake Larry.

00:59.770 --> 01:04.700
And actually what I'm going to do over here I'm going to actually have a script write the script for

01:04.700 --> 01:06.540
and I'm actually going to link it.

01:06.690 --> 01:14.830
So I'm going to write your script press time here and are you going to say source and the source is

01:14.830 --> 01:16.050
going to be script.

01:17.150 --> 01:18.870
So going to have a script Yes.

01:18.890 --> 01:21.290
And now let's just that out will it work.

01:21.540 --> 01:25.620
So I'm going to say we're here in exchange you're not going to go to script.

01:25.640 --> 01:26.400
Yes.

01:26.480 --> 01:31.880
And over here we can just simply write that this is going to be alert and over here we're going to say

01:32.000 --> 01:39.100
hello world you're going this we're going to say this and you can see that something is working right

01:39.310 --> 01:43.870
that something meaning Jack we're in right because you can see now we have a whole world up here.

01:43.930 --> 01:44.770
Right.

01:44.770 --> 01:50.220
However we need to do something a little bit more sophisticated than just writing.

01:50.320 --> 01:53.490
Right now it's not really hard.

01:53.500 --> 01:57.090
But anyway we just need to write a few lines of code.

01:57.310 --> 02:01.630
So first of all here we're going to use a dollar sign which is going to be selected for the inquiry.

02:01.650 --> 02:03.540
No we are going to have a document.

02:03.610 --> 02:09.040
Basically what I'm writing right now that I want my code to run only when the document sexually ready

02:09.650 --> 02:16.670
when the HD amount has been downloaded or here or done here I'm going to say function like this.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.230
And then we're going to have a curly braces right.

02:19.270 --> 02:21.410
So this is an anonymous function right.

02:21.430 --> 02:24.740
That's only going to run once the dam has been downloaded.

02:24.740 --> 02:29.380
All right I'm going to have a dollar sign right here I'm going to be targeting the target.

02:29.590 --> 02:37.360
So I'm going to say a dollar sign here I'm sorry hashtag which stands for A D I would say go between

02:37.870 --> 02:42.190
here and then we say what what should happen when this is going to be an event listener right.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.520
For a click event.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.740
So here you can see hÃ¤ndler.

02:45.920 --> 02:49.640
I know I'm going to say on here that this is going to be a function.

02:49.660 --> 02:55.910
Again I'm going to leave this anonymous function on here and what I'm going to say that for a links

02:56.860 --> 03:04.110
like this I'm going to say that class of links are here and I'm going to do a slight doggo.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.680
I'm going to say slide doggo.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.900
All right so you can see we have slide down slide up Moroder is going to slide toggle off.

03:12.340 --> 03:17.250
So then we have a slide going on here and in parentheses we're going to write again how long it takes.

03:17.260 --> 03:22.860
And again I always like to have my transitions or animations happening more period of time just sort

03:22.870 --> 03:23.680
of you can follow them.

03:23.710 --> 03:29.100
They're actually working to hear these 3000 maybe seconds means three seconds.

03:29.300 --> 03:35.260
So we say we're here now let's go maybe to the bigger screen right so we can close this guy over here.

03:35.300 --> 03:35.850
Right.

03:35.920 --> 03:39.340
And you can see this is going to be recording more refresh right.

03:39.340 --> 03:42.820
We let the actual J.A.G. start working now.

03:42.950 --> 03:45.340
Now we have a toddler right now.

03:45.340 --> 03:49.050
Again if we would have set up this one would say to 1 right.

03:49.150 --> 03:51.880
This is going to be much more closer to what you have with the bootstrap.

03:51.880 --> 03:52.290
Right.

03:52.450 --> 03:54.690
But set up is exactly the same right.

03:54.700 --> 03:57.730
I mean they have maybe a little bit different icons right.

03:57.730 --> 03:59.620
They have three bars in everything right.

03:59.660 --> 04:06.540
This is how easy you can actually make your not more responsive just using a little bit of worry like

04:06.630 --> 04:07.160
this.

04:07.240 --> 04:07.660
Right.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.940
And this is how we would work like this.

04:10.210 --> 04:15.980
So we can actually save this or this or script and we were going to need it for now.

04:15.990 --> 04:16.620
Right.

04:16.690 --> 04:21.880
And we can actually go ahead and start working on here with the C Ss with this banner.
