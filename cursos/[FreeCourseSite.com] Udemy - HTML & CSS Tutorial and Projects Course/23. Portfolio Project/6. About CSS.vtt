WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:04.680
So let's go ahead to the main C Ss and actually start styling.

00:04.710 --> 00:10.870
So as you can see or here we have the end of Boughner and now what we would want is the about section.

00:10.950 --> 00:14.230
So we're going to say or hear about section on here.

00:14.400 --> 00:20.670
Copy and paste this line on here and then we're going to say and of about section and what kind of rules

00:20.670 --> 00:21.410
we would want.

00:21.420 --> 00:22.070
Or.

00:22.270 --> 00:27.930
Well the first thing that we actually would want or hear is we would actually want to create one more

00:27.930 --> 00:28.750
variable.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.830
So I'm going to go all the way where I have my very most.

00:31.950 --> 00:36.600
And as you can see or here I have this section right now I'm actually going to create one more we're

00:36.710 --> 00:43.360
going to see a section what I'm going to say on here section right now I'm going to use the same color

00:43.360 --> 00:45.100
on here as this light.

00:45.120 --> 00:50.670
However in this case if you want to change the colors for the section they are actually separate.

00:50.670 --> 00:55.200
And if you want to change the colors you're actually working with fonts.

00:55.230 --> 00:56.320
They are also separate.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.390
So let's just first create this fact.

00:58.680 --> 01:02.070
And once we have created the variable that's right away use it.

01:02.100 --> 01:09.440
So I'm going to say on here we would want to target about section or here would want a panning to RPMs

01:09.470 --> 01:10.550
for the.

01:10.590 --> 01:16.250
I know you're going to say zero and I can see that we created a padding of top bottom.

01:16.260 --> 01:20.130
Now let's create a little bit more space on here and next.

01:20.130 --> 01:23.810
What I would want is actually have the background for the About section.

01:23.940 --> 01:26.670
So the background again we're going to say the same thing.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.550
Var key word here.

01:28.770 --> 01:33.270
And then we would want section and section white on this.

01:33.270 --> 01:37.350
So once we save it now we have our background as a section white.

01:37.560 --> 01:42.330
Now after that what I would want is actually work with about Center.

01:42.540 --> 01:49.190
So this was the center of all this because every year has about more here and center.

01:49.200 --> 01:55.530
So this is going to be to underscore center note here what I would want is a max with some to say that

01:55.530 --> 01:58.080
it never gets bigger than 90.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.600
Are you with us over here.

02:00.600 --> 02:04.040
And also what I would want is I would want to place it in a center.

02:04.290 --> 02:09.520
So once I save it I would want to place it in the center or here I'm going to save some of the same

02:09.520 --> 02:12.620
margin to R.E.M. start bottom.

02:12.630 --> 02:16.580
So this is going to be the margin for the bottom line here we're going to say Oh.

02:16.710 --> 02:20.520
So this is going to make sure that we have the margin on top bottom.

02:20.700 --> 02:28.360
But the fact that we're also always in the center now after that let's actually fix the photo.

02:28.420 --> 02:36.030
So let's say we're here and we would want is about I am g here and I'm going to say 4.

02:36.220 --> 02:44.040
So 2 underscores for all here for the photo first we would want a display block or here and then we

02:44.040 --> 02:47.660
would want a with or here of 100 percent.

02:47.670 --> 02:52.770
So in this case what happens now I can see that our image actually fits perfectly.

02:52.920 --> 02:59.350
Mike Not like before where actually it was stretching and actually making a scroll.

02:59.490 --> 03:05.160
And also let's do right away a height of 100 percent like this.

03:05.310 --> 03:09.340
And the last one we're going to say is going to be position route.

03:09.360 --> 03:13.760
So we're going to save here position and we're going to do it.

03:14.100 --> 03:21.030
So once we have about photo let's actually come back a little bit and let's say about actual image.

03:21.030 --> 03:25.730
So this is going to be the parent and then we would want for this about image.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.640
Also some margins and some positioning.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.080
So we're going to see or hear about G.

03:31.290 --> 03:36.010
And here we're going to see margin 3 RPMs and 0.

03:36.210 --> 03:43.890
So top bottom on here for this Dave is going to be free all Reems and then we're going to want a position

03:44.370 --> 03:46.580
relative like this.

03:46.590 --> 03:50.120
So this is what we're going to do here for the parent content.

03:50.130 --> 03:55.150
Now the last thing that I would want here is to work more here.

03:55.260 --> 04:03.210
You see that we have this dark underline on here so we can see that there's going to be a dark day of

04:03.600 --> 04:06.790
there's going to be placed somewhere around the edge.

04:06.810 --> 04:08.160
So how do we do this.

04:08.400 --> 04:15.450
Well here we're going to go and we're going to create a new rule so we're going to say about we're here

04:15.450 --> 04:16.270
I am g.

04:16.320 --> 04:21.840
So the parent container for the image and then on going right before.

04:21.840 --> 04:27.630
So now once we have this rule then we're here we're going to say content and we're going to say that

04:27.630 --> 04:32.970
this is just going to be an empty card and then we would want is a background and for this we're going

04:32.970 --> 04:36.790
to say this is going to be var and then we're going to use the green one.

04:36.850 --> 04:39.780
So he'll say that this is going to be in great one.

04:39.780 --> 04:48.600
So once I say that nothing is actually shot now let's do a width of 100 percent then let's do a height

04:48.950 --> 04:52.380
so of 100 percent like this.

04:52.410 --> 04:57.750
And then we would want is a position an absolute rule like this.

04:57.870 --> 05:01.930
So we're going to have a position of and we still cannot see it.

05:02.010 --> 05:09.630
Now let's do a bottom here bottom and bottom is going to be negative 10 pixels or here.

05:09.800 --> 05:16.650
So I can see that it's popping over here from the bottom and then all we want is a left here of negative

05:16.680 --> 05:18.200
10 pixels also.

05:18.210 --> 05:21.660
So now you can see that we're making this effect here.

05:21.780 --> 05:25.130
Now obviously we can place whatever we want on here.

05:25.140 --> 05:30.420
Let's say we could place an image or whatever we would want but important thing to remember is that

05:30.870 --> 05:35.340
if we're using this before then we're setting it is absolute.

05:35.460 --> 05:41.080
So whatever we do in a place it's all about image we need to make sure that this is going to be rolled.

05:41.330 --> 05:43.520
So that's going to be the most important thing.

05:43.690 --> 05:46.240
Now we are done with an about image.

05:46.350 --> 05:48.960
Let's start working with an about in full.

05:49.050 --> 05:50.750
So again let's do the same thing.

05:51.000 --> 05:59.280
Let's just create more room here and let's say that we would want about info and what we would want

05:59.480 --> 06:00.350
about it.

06:00.520 --> 06:05.140
And then we would want to margin three RPMs and zero.

06:05.160 --> 06:12.440
And the reason why we're actually selecting this is because we want to have more margins in between.

06:12.450 --> 06:18.580
So basically we will want to make sure that in the small screen they're not bumping into each other.

06:18.600 --> 06:25.540
So we're here to consider if we have or hear about info and or hear about image to make sure that they

06:25.650 --> 06:27.960
are actually stacked on top of each other.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.940
However there's still some space in between.

06:31.200 --> 06:40.990
So once we have selected class about inform what to do about an info and for how about info title.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.940
So first let's do a trial.

06:43.230 --> 06:44.840
And what we would want for the title.

06:45.140 --> 06:49.960
Well first words do any font size three rpms.

06:50.180 --> 06:56.200
And this is going to be bigger text than we're going to have a text transform.

06:56.220 --> 07:05.940
And for a text form we're going to capitalize and let's do also a letter spacing 0.5 RPM.

07:06.100 --> 07:11.050
And last but not least let's actually set a background so that the background will just say I really

07:11.050 --> 07:16.750
like this background then we're going to have a U R L and R here are going to we're going to go to the

07:16.750 --> 07:17.610
Heminges.

07:17.710 --> 07:25.950
So quotation marks that we're going to find images and then we will want is a tidal mangrove Rigi or

07:25.960 --> 07:26.350
here.

07:26.490 --> 07:27.610
So I'm going to save this.

07:27.760 --> 07:30.400
And you can see that now it's spanning all across.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.050
The only thing we need to write is here no.

07:33.250 --> 07:37.340
So now this image is going to be only here in the.

07:37.770 --> 07:39.710
And once we're done with it.

07:39.970 --> 07:42.850
And it's actually work with this text here.

07:42.970 --> 07:44.470
So this is going to be the next one.

07:44.560 --> 07:50.120
So about here in info and we're all going to say text.

07:50.430 --> 07:52.110
And what we would want for the text.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.370
Well first let's make it a color.

07:54.580 --> 08:02.250
And again let's use voire and let's use gray or grey variable is going to be for a text.

08:02.260 --> 08:09.060
Now once we have the text gray let's do a line height for the line height.

08:09.070 --> 08:12.460
We're going to say one point five or here.

08:12.670 --> 08:20.180
So the line is going to be bigger font size is going to be 1.2 RPMs here.

08:20.380 --> 08:27.010
And also you'd want a margin and for the margin again we would want the same thing for your IEMs and

08:27.010 --> 08:27.980
0.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.800
So this is going to make sure we have a bigger margin for it.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.550
And then let's actually style the length.

08:35.040 --> 08:38.050
So here again let's create more space here.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.840
And let's actually styled it.

08:41.020 --> 08:41.920
Now for the link.

08:41.980 --> 08:49.330
Remember we had a class of about 1 here in fall and then we had a single link here.

08:49.390 --> 08:50.700
And this was our class.

08:50.950 --> 08:56.160
So what we would want first of all we would want display an inline block.

08:56.240 --> 09:01.210
So this is going to be our first rule because what we would want is we would want to actually apply

09:01.480 --> 09:04.990
the margins and paddings and this is going to be better way.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.950
So text decoration.

09:07.090 --> 09:08.150
We're going to say not.

09:08.270 --> 09:12.790
So we're going to get rid of this annoying the line then we're going to do a panning.

09:12.880 --> 09:17.410
The bottom is going to be 1.5 RPMs and you know what.

09:17.410 --> 09:23.500
No actually it's going to be for RPMs and this is going to be one area two left and right is going to

09:23.500 --> 09:29.940
be one of the lead we would want is a font size or here one size.

09:30.070 --> 09:35.470
And what do fun size 1 point 1.5 are Ahab's.

09:35.480 --> 09:43.120
Now once we have the fun size let's do letters spacing 0.2 Reems and after the letter spacing again

09:43.150 --> 09:48.120
text transform capitalize and border.

09:48.340 --> 09:51.280
Let's do a border and this is going to be dark.

09:51.280 --> 09:57.540
So I'm going to say over here and this is going to be three pixels solid and let's do one here and again

09:57.540 --> 09:59.250
and we're going to use this variable.

09:59.290 --> 10:01.900
So I'm going to say here and this is going to be dark.

10:01.930 --> 10:05.510
Now we can see that we have this dark border.

10:06.010 --> 10:11.560
And then after that we would want is a transition because what I would want is as you can see as I'm

10:11.560 --> 10:17.870
hovering over the change is happening over time as you can see that we can always make the hover effect.

10:17.980 --> 10:20.870
However the hover effect doesn't happen over time.

10:20.920 --> 10:27.400
So what we want to do is we would want is a transition no different transition we have couple of things.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.440
First of all what kind of transition.

10:29.500 --> 10:34.540
Well we're going to say we're here all because we would want all transitions to be affected by this.

10:34.540 --> 10:37.150
Then this is going to be the time how long it's going to take.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.050
No this is going to be linear.

10:39.130 --> 10:44.780
So this is going to be how this transition is taking effect whether it's happening linearly and there's

10:44.800 --> 10:51.450
going to be an option say ease in and out or ease in and we're just going to pick a winner.

10:51.460 --> 10:55.910
So basically once this is going to start working it's going to all the way to the end without changing.

10:56.140 --> 11:02.920
And over here we're going to say margin and we're going to do a margin right in the margin rate is going

11:02.920 --> 11:04.640
to be 1 rpms.

11:04.660 --> 11:07.720
So I'm going to say one on TMZ or here like this.

11:07.720 --> 11:11.500
So this is going to be our margin right now.

11:11.500 --> 11:17.370
Also remember we had this dark button here and the lighting button number these guys.

11:17.370 --> 11:19.570
So now we're going to style the actual colors.

11:19.750 --> 11:27.100
So I'm going to go back over here and we're going to say that for these dark between we would want first

11:27.190 --> 11:30.100
a background and the background is going to be dark.

11:30.130 --> 11:31.910
So we're going to see dark.

11:32.100 --> 11:37.300
And once we say it you can see the dark background here and the colors is going to be white.

11:37.360 --> 11:40.720
So I'm going to say here we are and this is going to be light.

11:40.870 --> 11:47.290
So we say that the color is dark but the color is actually white and also do right away a effect.

11:47.470 --> 11:50.080
So dark DTN cover.

11:50.260 --> 11:53.270
So as we're hovering over this what should happen.

11:53.480 --> 11:59.100
Well first let's say this is going to be a background and the background is going to be the other way.

11:59.290 --> 12:07.010
So we're going to have a ground is going to be light so light or hearing this and the actual color is

12:07.010 --> 12:08.060
going to be dark.

12:08.060 --> 12:13.880
So basically it's opposite are here this is going to be dark or like this.

12:13.900 --> 12:18.880
So what happens as I'm hovering You can see that the change is happening over time.

12:19.100 --> 12:24.800
Now if I'm going to go back over here and if I'm just going to come on the sound and say you can see

12:24.800 --> 12:26.180
that it's going to happen right away.

12:26.390 --> 12:31.310
And this is not what you would want because with this transition we could actually manipulate how long

12:31.310 --> 12:32.090
we would want.

12:32.270 --> 12:37.420
So let's say here I can write 10 seconds if I would want in this case I'm going to write one but you

12:37.780 --> 12:41.440
just understand that this gives you way more options.

12:41.810 --> 12:45.910
Now once we have the door button we also need a light button.

12:45.950 --> 12:52.190
So in the same way we're here we're going to say that this is going to be light between light between.

12:52.370 --> 12:56.580
And for this guy we're actually going to be working the other way around.

12:56.630 --> 12:59.920
So first of all going to say that the caller is going to be dark.

13:00.080 --> 13:07.610
So for the caller was going to say that we would want dark Savar and dark or dark.

13:07.610 --> 13:14.510
So this is going to be a dark color for this light button and then once we're hovering then we basically

13:14.510 --> 13:21.080
will want the opposite way we would want the background to be dark and the actual color to be white

13:21.290 --> 13:23.080
symmetrical or something like this.

13:23.090 --> 13:29.430
So all we can do or here we can just copy and paste this and we're going to save for the light be diyan

13:29.750 --> 13:33.400
However again as we're hovering we would want these rules.

13:33.500 --> 13:39.710
So if all going to go back or here you can see that as I'm hovering now concede that it's changing from

13:39.710 --> 13:46.550
light and dark and so here this is changing from dark to white and the last thing that we would want

13:46.640 --> 13:52.320
is actually applied meteors because for now if we're going to go over here to our recording and fog

13:52.360 --> 13:57.650
and our fresh air here you can see that this is how they are going to be displaying doesn't matter of

13:57.650 --> 13:59.090
the screen size or here.

13:59.270 --> 14:02.880
And this is not what we would want at a certain screen size.

14:02.900 --> 14:08.600
We would actually would want to use a flex box and actually place them side by side or here like this.

14:08.600 --> 14:13.280
So you can see once here make it big enough for my screen you can see they're actually going to be side

14:13.280 --> 14:14.130
by side.

14:14.180 --> 14:21.740
So let's go back over here and let's say this is going to be an all out media screen and for this we're

14:21.740 --> 14:28.100
going to say and no one here would want a man with superhero going to see men with.

14:28.100 --> 14:35.240
And what would be this man with all these men with what we would want is going to be nine and two pixels.

14:35.240 --> 14:38.010
So this is where the change is actually going to happen.

14:38.120 --> 14:42.420
Now we're here what we would want or I would want first about Center.

14:42.440 --> 14:49.310
So if you remember here this was a class about CENTERA class which is actually a parent.

14:49.370 --> 14:54.170
It is a parent for the article about image and also the parent for about infant.

14:54.340 --> 14:55.770
So both of these actual work.

14:55.860 --> 15:02.050
So we're going to go back over here to the main thesis and we're going to say about Center here.

15:02.180 --> 15:05.740
And we would want to display flex here.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.250
This is going to be the first one.

15:07.310 --> 15:12.650
And also we would want to have justified content and we're going to say space between and this is going

15:12.650 --> 15:18.740
to make sure that since we're going to be applying our own paddings in between this is going to make

15:18.740 --> 15:22.990
sure that they're always as far away from each other as possible.

15:23.170 --> 15:25.220
Here we can have a space between.

15:25.480 --> 15:30.950
And once we have the above center then we would want to work with children and for the children is actually

15:30.950 --> 15:36.530
going to be very easy to say about here and this is going to be the end for this is going to be the

15:36.530 --> 15:41.840
first article child and on here who'd want a about an image.

15:41.840 --> 15:47.840
So this is going to be the second fluxbox show where you are and what we would want for both of them.

15:48.020 --> 15:52.730
Well first we would want is a flex and the flex is going to be like this.

15:52.730 --> 15:53.810
They're not going to grow.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.390
So the growth is going to be zero.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.030
They're not going to shrink shrink it's going to be zero.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.850
And here we're going to write Coke.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.500
So we're going to be calculating.

16:01.580 --> 16:04.660
So we're making use of this called function.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.870
Or here we can write the values.

16:07.130 --> 16:09.550
So here I'm going to say 50 percent.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.390
So I would want them to be 50 percent.

16:12.530 --> 16:20.960
However I'm going to actually subtract one rpm and this one rpm is actually going to be spacing between.

16:21.020 --> 16:23.120
So there are going to be 50 percent.

16:23.120 --> 16:28.340
How are you going to make sure that there is some distance in between or here that's why we're using

16:28.340 --> 16:29.400
the space between.

16:29.510 --> 16:34.150
Because this is going to make sure that they're actually placed as far away from each other.

16:34.160 --> 16:39.770
Now why are you working with cogged just be careful to actually have spaces in between the subtraction

16:39.780 --> 16:40.210
side.

16:40.410 --> 16:44.690
Otherwise you're not going to have it the success is not going to render properly.

16:44.850 --> 16:49.300
So let's say we're going to save this and that's got to put forward a record.

16:49.470 --> 16:50.820
And let's check it out here.

16:51.050 --> 16:53.080
So this is what we have over here.

16:53.150 --> 16:58.370
The last thing that I would want is depending on a marriage there's going to be cases where you would

16:58.370 --> 16:58.700
want.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.120
Actually this text you go lower.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.870
So how are you going to do this.

17:02.870 --> 17:08.840
Well remember whenever you've been working in the exchange hymnal we had this rapper we had this about

17:08.880 --> 17:12.130
in info container that we had over here.

17:12.170 --> 17:15.980
Now we also had a parent of about four.

17:16.220 --> 17:23.160
So the reason for placing everything in this wrapper was that I can use fluxbox properties again for

17:23.340 --> 17:24.260
about four.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.340
And what we need to remember that for is about Inform.

17:27.390 --> 17:31.080
There's only one child in this one about in full container.

17:31.190 --> 17:38.570
So if I'm going to go back over here and if I'm going to say that out 140 about info about info and

17:38.570 --> 17:41.200
what I would want for it first I'm going to say this play.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.990
And we're going to do flex more here like this.

17:44.090 --> 17:50.600
And once we actually have this play flex here we're going to say a line in EMS and we're going to just

17:50.780 --> 17:51.210
flex.

17:51.230 --> 17:57.680
And so basically if the image is actually going to be way bigger which is in our case it's not the case

17:58.000 --> 18:03.200
where we're going to do is we're going to make sure that you can see that right now my about is sitting

18:03.200 --> 18:03.810
over here.

18:03.980 --> 18:08.600
So if I'm going to go back all here and if I'm actually going to come on this out.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.700
So let's say that this is not going to exist.

18:10.910 --> 18:12.960
Let's see actually how this is going to look like.

18:12.980 --> 18:20.480
So once I refresh you can see that my text is on top but if I'm using this about info like this you

18:20.480 --> 18:23.090
can see that it is displaying flex.

18:23.240 --> 18:30.500
But since it has only one child it just basically moves this or this container all the way to the bottom

18:30.800 --> 18:32.880
with all the text inside already.

18:32.900 --> 18:36.940
So we're all going to say we're here is we're going to go back to main sources say.

18:37.030 --> 18:38.290
And once we refresh.

18:38.420 --> 18:40.160
Sure enough you can see or hear that.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.800
Now my text is actually in the bottom.
