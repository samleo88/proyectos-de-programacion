WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:06.940
Next up we have a line items that is responsible for vertical alignment.

00:07.020 --> 00:12.510
Now before we can start testing out a line items properly with all its values.

00:12.510 --> 00:19.110
One thing we're gonna have to do is set up some kind of height for our container because please understand

00:19.110 --> 00:26.850
that currently what happens is the height of our container is dependent on the height of our items.

00:26.850 --> 00:30.140
So I could set up any kind of properties with values.

00:30.150 --> 00:37.080
As far as vertical alignment and well nothing is going to change because in fact our container has the

00:37.080 --> 00:38.490
height of our items.

00:38.490 --> 00:40.540
Now we can do it multiple ways.

00:40.620 --> 00:47.400
I could set it up as height and 300 pixels and noticed right away our container got bigger.

00:47.430 --> 00:54.120
I could also use the viewport values where we could go with height and you view height.

00:54.180 --> 00:59.450
It's really up to us and doesn't really matter as long as you have some kind of fight.

00:59.570 --> 01:03.120
And would you notice right away that again by default.

01:03.300 --> 01:09.100
Behind the scenes we already have a line items set to stretch.

01:09.150 --> 01:15.030
That's the reason why our items are stretching from the top of our container all the way to the bottom

01:15.120 --> 01:16.480
of our container.

01:16.500 --> 01:23.970
So if I'm gonna go with a line items and I'm gonna set it equal to stretch I'm gonna notice that our

01:23.970 --> 01:25.640
layout did not change.

01:25.730 --> 01:28.490
Because again that is the default behavior.

01:28.500 --> 01:36.930
However we also have other values like for example flex start let's make up in paste that let's change

01:36.930 --> 01:37.290
this.

01:37.320 --> 01:45.420
Let's say flex start and what you're going to notice is that right now my boxes are aligned to the top

01:45.510 --> 01:47.060
of the container.

01:47.490 --> 01:49.420
That's the value for my flex start.

01:49.980 --> 01:56.880
And you can probably already guess that if I'm gonna go with Flex and where do you think the boxes are

01:56.880 --> 01:58.320
gonna be located.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.830
Well they're gonna be all the way in the bottom correct.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.900
Then we also have the center one.

02:04.110 --> 02:11.150
Probably the most beautiful thing ever because you're noticing the pain that we have to do when we're

02:11.190 --> 02:13.170
just dealing with the regular assess.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.860
We have to go with some kind of hack or something like that.

02:16.860 --> 02:24.540
In this case if we want to align something horizontally as long as we do have the height for our container

02:25.110 --> 02:27.200
it is as easy as it gets.

02:27.210 --> 02:33.360
Just go with the center and your content is going to be aligned vertically in the center which is just

02:33.390 --> 02:34.180
beautiful.

02:34.260 --> 02:35.340
If you ask me.

02:35.360 --> 02:35.960
OK.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.630
And then of course we have the baseline.

02:39.090 --> 02:43.510
So let's cut and paste it and let me show you how the baseline is going to work.

02:43.530 --> 02:48.420
Now initially you're going to think well wait a minute this is exactly the same how we had with Flex

02:48.420 --> 02:49.130
start.

02:49.250 --> 02:51.940
However there are some caveats.

02:52.230 --> 02:58.980
So if we're going to head over to a Stiles and let's say for the box number three I'm going to increase

02:58.980 --> 03:07.830
the font size so how my box number three and I'm going to go with font size of let's say sixty five

03:08.070 --> 03:09.080
pixels.

03:09.570 --> 03:16.530
What are you going to notice is that my box is when using the baseline one are aligned depending on

03:16.650 --> 03:18.620
where the content is right.

03:19.110 --> 03:22.050
If we go would stretch or I'm sorry.

03:22.050 --> 03:22.740
Let's start.

03:23.190 --> 03:26.040
So let me come on these guys out as well.

03:26.040 --> 03:33.000
If we go would start in fact boxes are still going to be aligned depending on where the edge of the

03:33.000 --> 03:34.340
boxes correct.

03:34.350 --> 03:36.850
That's the reason when the box is bigger.

03:36.930 --> 03:42.300
Now we can see that it is not aligned here in the bottom correctly because we're not aligning depending

03:42.300 --> 03:46.050
where the content is we're aligning where the boxes start.

03:46.490 --> 03:47.870
Now where would you use that.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.680
Where would you use let's say baseline.

03:50.130 --> 03:56.400
While most common thing is or one of the common things is when we have the now are correct we usually

03:56.400 --> 04:04.010
have some kind of logo now a logo has a different size than rest of the items usually whereas the links

04:04.350 --> 04:04.830
and you're not.

04:04.830 --> 04:11.190
In order to show that better you know what why don't we grab the font size and had it here for the item

04:11.190 --> 04:12.210
number one.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.020
So our logo let's imagine this is gonna be our logo.

04:15.150 --> 04:17.450
And these are all our links.

04:17.460 --> 04:23.660
So what you would probably want to do is outline them in fact where your content is right.

04:23.700 --> 04:31.410
So they are in fact in one line instead of having a logo sitting here and then your links sitting let's

04:31.410 --> 04:33.090
say above the logo.

04:33.450 --> 04:34.980
That's where you would use the baseline.

04:35.340 --> 04:38.940
But again it is mostly your preference whatever you'd like.

04:38.940 --> 04:41.220
You can also align them in the center.

04:41.220 --> 04:43.040
It is really up to you.

04:43.350 --> 04:48.630
Like so where we just align them here and center and that is also always your option.

04:48.630 --> 04:55.680
So like I said we covered both of the properties one for justify content for horizontal alignment and

04:55.680 --> 05:03.040
the other one for aligning items vertically which the name of a line items which essentially are going

05:03.040 --> 05:06.800
to be your favorite legs box properties.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.830
Now of course I can't guarantee that.

05:08.860 --> 05:15.430
But most likely I'm telling you that you will have those as your favorite properties because they really

05:15.640 --> 05:18.900
are going to simplify how you're setting up your layouts.
