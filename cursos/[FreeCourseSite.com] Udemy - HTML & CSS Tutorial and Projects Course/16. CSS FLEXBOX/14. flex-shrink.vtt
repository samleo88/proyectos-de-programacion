00:00.270 --> 00:03.120
Similarly how we have legs grow.

00:03.120 --> 00:06.090
We also have a flex shrink.

00:06.090 --> 00:09.840
And by default again all the children have the Flex shrink.

00:09.860 --> 00:14.000
However in this case since 40 legs grow we have a zero.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.290
So they were not growing.

00:16.290 --> 00:18.980
In this case flex shrink is set to 1.

00:19.080 --> 00:25.540
So there are going to shrink in order to in fact make space for rest of the Arabs grow up.

00:25.600 --> 00:31.200
Now as always the best case scenario would be for me to show you with an example.

00:31.590 --> 00:38.670
So let's imagine this case where I have the item number two and I think that my Item 2 is going to look

00:38.670 --> 00:41.480
best if it is let's say 300 pixels.

00:41.820 --> 00:46.500
So we're gonna set box number and I said no to some reason I'm targeting number 3.

00:46.890 --> 00:48.610
So my apologies.

00:48.630 --> 00:51.610
Well let's go with Box Number Two.

00:51.670 --> 00:54.080
Waste of 300 pixels.

00:54.630 --> 01:01.810
We set a box but I can already know is that once my screen size gets in fact smaller.

01:02.110 --> 01:04.600
Well it's definitely not 300 pixels.

01:05.010 --> 01:09.420
Now if I go to the bigger screen yes sure enough I have my 300 pixels.

01:09.420 --> 01:16.500
But then as my screen size gets smaller and smaller in order to fit my elements within my container

01:16.770 --> 01:20.630
of course flux is in fact shrinking my box number two.

01:20.720 --> 01:26.580
Now the reason why we are shrinking our box well because by default again we have flex shrink and instead

01:26.580 --> 01:33.360
of zero like we had for Flex grow when they were not growing by default by default all the items are

01:33.360 --> 01:34.530
going to be shrinking.

01:34.740 --> 01:41.760
Okay now in order to fix that we are going to go with Flex shrink that is the property and we're going

01:41.760 --> 01:43.670
to set it equal to zero.

01:43.680 --> 01:44.410
Now in this case.

01:44.420 --> 01:49.440
Notice I have my 300 pixel item or a box.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.090
Call it all it like.

01:51.270 --> 01:57.120
And then as my screen size gets smaller and smaller the item is not going to get smaller.

01:57.120 --> 02:03.690
And if we cannot fit in fact rest of the items Well again we're going to have the overflow.

02:03.750 --> 02:08.820
Now please keep in mind that doesn't mean that we're going to shrink the rest of the items basically

02:08.820 --> 02:09.780
to nothing.

02:09.780 --> 02:16.500
We also had here the farm sizes and the patterns all that so the Flex box is not just gonna get rid

02:16.500 --> 02:16.870
of them.

02:17.200 --> 02:17.810
Okay.

02:17.880 --> 02:22.880
When I say shrink that means we're still going to have some base values.

02:23.190 --> 02:29.520
However of course we do have right now wrapping and we know that in order to fix that now had our property

02:29.670 --> 02:34.910
by the name of flux wrap and we're just gonna wrap our content.

02:34.920 --> 02:44.220
So in this case if there is not enough room to let's say set box number two with rest of the items well

02:44.220 --> 02:46.060
we're gonna be wrapping in new lines.

02:46.230 --> 02:47.350
That's all we're gonna be doing.

02:47.850 --> 02:52.650
And that's how we can work with a flex shrink property in the flex box.
