00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,380
So, let's go ahead and create a Python
script and learn how to run it. So, i'm

2

00:00:04,380  -->  00:00:07,230
going to be doing this in terminal
completely we will discuss other options

3

00:00:07,230  -->  00:00:18,480
later, what I need to do first is change
directory into "pycharm projects" and

4

00:00:18,480  -->  00:00:23,430
there's nothing really in here so i'm
going to create a file using the nano

5

00:00:23,430  -->  00:00:26,939
text editor, you guys don't have to
follow along,

6

00:00:27,750  -->  00:00:32,759
however if you want to that's great too.
I'm just going to call it test.py. Now

7

00:00:32,759  -->  00:00:39,450
all Python scripts need to have the .py
extension. So, what we're going to do is

8

00:00:39,450  -->  00:00:46,920
just a simple, simple script it's going
to print "hello world"

9

00:00:48,780  -->  00:00:51,870
So, I'm going to control +

10

00:00:51,870  -->  00:01:00,600
O to save, and control + C to exit, control + X to exit.

11

00:01:03,030  -->  00:01:06,630
Alright, now if we just type "test.py"

12

00:01:07,830  -->  00:01:15,180
you'll see BASH doesn't know what to do
with this command because test.py is

13

00:01:15,180  -->  00:01:23,520
not an installed program. So what we need to do is run "python3 test.py" and it will

14

00:01:23,520  -->  00:01:30,689
return the result of anything in that
script. So, that's how to run python

15

00:01:30,689  -->  00:01:34,950
scripts, in the next video what we're going to be doing is setting up an actual work

16

00:01:34,950  -->  00:01:42,720
environment using an IDE, and get you
guys all ready to start with the basics.
