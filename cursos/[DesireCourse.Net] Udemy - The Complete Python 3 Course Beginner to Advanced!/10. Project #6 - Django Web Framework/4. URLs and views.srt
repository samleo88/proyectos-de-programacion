00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,200
Hey there guys, welcome back. We've learned

2

00:00:03,210  -->  00:00:06,019
how to insert posts into the database

3

00:00:06,029  -->  00:00:07,639
and now we need to learn how to bring

4

00:00:07,649  -->  00:00:09,230
them out on to the front end, and how to

5

00:00:09,240  -->  00:00:12,350
view them in the web browser. So what

6

00:00:12,360  -->  00:00:13,640
we're going to do in this video we're

7

00:00:13,650  -->  00:00:15,530
going to be working in three files, so in

8

00:00:15,540  -->  00:00:16,910
the main directory, in the root directory,

9

00:00:16,920  -->  00:00:20,000
go ahead and open up urls.py. In the

10

00:00:20,010  -->  00:00:22,670
blog subdirectory go ahead and open up

11

00:00:22,680  -->  00:00:25,700
views.py and these are really the

12

00:00:25,710  -->  00:00:27,470
only two files were working with at this

13

00:00:27,480  -->  00:00:30,679
point, the third one we are going to be

14

00:00:30,689  -->  00:00:32,780
creating it in a little bit, probably

15

00:00:32,790  -->  00:00:34,040
actually the next video.

16

00:00:34,050  -->  00:00:36,380
So, what we're going to do here we

17

00:00:36,390  -->  00:00:39,470
actually need to create some views in

18

00:00:39,480  -->  00:00:42,889
order to to show them by url, so what

19

00:00:42,899  -->  00:00:43,940
we're going to do well actually we're

20

00:00:43,950  -->  00:00:46,190
going to start out with URLs. So what we're

21

00:00:46,200  -->  00:00:49,190
going to do we're going to import this

22

00:00:49,200  -->  00:00:53,119
views file so the path is blog views, so

23

00:00:53,129  -->  00:00:55,250
what we're going to do is "from blog"

24

00:00:55,260  -->  00:00:58,160
which is the director name "import views"

25

00:00:58,170  -->  00:01:00,680
and now we might have views from a bunch

26

00:01:00,690  -->  00:01:02,840
of different apps, so what we're going to

27

00:01:02,850  -->  00:01:05,359
be doing is remaining these as we import

28

00:01:05,369  -->  00:01:10,880
them. So, "as blog_views" then what

29

00:01:10,890  -->  00:01:11,840
we're going to do is we're going to

30

00:01:11,850  -->  00:01:14,210
create a few routes here, so let's go

31

00:01:14,220  -->  00:01:16,520
ahead and create a single post route. So,

32

00:01:16,530  -->  00:01:18,770
"url" and we're going to open up

33

00:01:18,780  -->  00:01:23,780
regex here we're going to say "(r'post/%')"

34

00:01:23,790  -->  00:01:26,240
"(r'post/%')"

35

00:01:26,250  -->  00:01:27,649
We're going to say that's going to route

36

00:01:27,659  -->  00:01:32,510
to the method in the blog views called

37

00:01:32,520  -->  00:01:39,260
", blog_views.post" and then we're going to go ahead

38

00:01:39,270  -->  00:01:43,399
and create an index page route. So,

39

00:01:43,409  -->  00:01:44,929
"url(r'^')"

40

00:01:44,939  -->  00:01:46,520
make sure and put the pointy thing, and I didn't do that up

41

00:01:46,530  -->  00:01:49,280
here, you need to do that and this is

42

00:01:49,290  -->  00:01:51,350
just going to be / so this is really it.

43

00:01:51,360  -->  00:01:53,870
Just put the $ right there and

44

00:01:53,880  -->  00:01:56,600
then go ahead and from this route we're

45

00:01:56,610  -->  00:02:00,560
going to be loading up "blog_views.index"

46

00:02:00,570  -->  00:02:03,289
then put a comma there. Now we're only going

47

00:02:03,299  -->  00:02:05,569
to be defining two routes at this point and

48

00:02:05,579  -->  00:02:07,490
this probably says we don't have those

49

00:02:07,500  -->  00:02:12,260
views. So what we're going to do is we're

50

00:02:12,270  -->  00:02:13,430
going to go ahead and open

51

00:02:13,440  -->  00:02:14,930
up the views file right here and

52

00:02:14,940  -->  00:02:16,520
we're going to create them. So in order

53

00:02:16,530  -->  00:02:18,620
to do this we need to actually import

54

00:02:18,630  -->  00:02:22,670
something first, so "from django.http" we

55

00:02:22,680  -->  00:02:26,630
need to import a class called "HttpResponse"

56

00:02:26,640  -->  00:02:30,290
And right here we're going to start

57

00:02:30,300  -->  00:02:33,410
writing our views so the first one we're

58

00:02:33,420  -->  00:02:35,390
going to write is the index, so go ahead

59

00:02:35,400  -->  00:02:40,310
and write "def index( )" and for every view

60

00:02:40,320  -->  00:02:43,130
that you create with django you need to

61

00:02:43,140  -->  00:02:47,120
pass a parameter named "request" into

62

00:02:47,130  -->  00:02:52,670
the function, so there we go.

63

00:02:52,680  -->  00:02:54,110
And now what we're going to do is we're

64

00:02:54,120  -->  00:02:55,880
going to get all the posts, actually for

65

00:02:55,890  -->  00:02:57,530
right now we're just going to return a

66

00:02:57,540  -->  00:03:01,130
simple page, so "return HttpResponse( )"

67

00:03:01,140  -->  00:03:06,650
and in here create and string call it or

68

00:03:06,660  -->  00:03:10,190
let's make it say "Hey there." and then

69

00:03:10,200  -->  00:03:13,820
we're going to create the post view as

70

00:03:13,830  -->  00:03:15,800
well and I believe I named that post,

71

00:03:15,810  -->  00:03:19,640
right. Let's go ahead and "def post(request):"

72

00:03:19,650  -->  00:03:28,850
"return HttpResponse("I'm a single post page.")"

73

00:03:28,860  -->  00:03:32,960
We're going to save this. We should

74

00:03:32,970  -->  00:03:35,000
be good right now to go ahead and load

75

00:03:35,010  -->  00:03:39,229
up our application I believe, and refresh, and

76

00:03:39,239  -->  00:03:41,600
as you can see our main page already

77

00:03:41,610  -->  00:03:42,590
shows

78

00:03:42,600  -->  00:03:46,580
hey there and if we go to /post we see

79

00:03:46,590  -->  00:03:52,880
I'm a single post page.
