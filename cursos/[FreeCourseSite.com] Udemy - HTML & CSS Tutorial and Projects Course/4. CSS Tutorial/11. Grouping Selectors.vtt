If you want to be extremely precise we should address these selectors as elements elect.

00:06.280 --> 00:08.190
So if you're a stickler for names.

00:08.290 --> 00:09.340
Here we go.

00:09.340 --> 00:15.220
Keep in mind though at least in my opinion it is much more important to know how to use them not remember.

00:15.220 --> 00:17.330
Every naming convention out there.

00:17.540 --> 00:22.220
Well that being said once we have elements selectors now see us as tool belt.

00:22.650 --> 00:29.680
CSX offer something really cool called Element grouping where we can combine multiple selectors while

00:29.680 --> 00:32.320
we all use elements selectors as our example.

00:32.650 --> 00:39.780
Please understand that you can group any features CSO selectors will cover in the future the same way.

00:39.910 --> 00:42.690
So how selector grouping would work.

00:42.820 --> 00:45.100
So let's say right now we have three selectors.

00:45.160 --> 00:50.950
We have the heading One heading to and part and what we would want to do is let's say we would want

00:51.070 --> 00:52.270
the whole text to be blue.

00:52.960 --> 00:58.420
While you can say the simplest way would be very simple we could just select the body.

00:58.600 --> 01:05.980
Since this is a tag and add colour blue so let's try this out maybe let me delete this and let's say

01:05.980 --> 01:14.830
that instead of selecting adding one or paragraph we can just do body and we can use colour blue so

01:14.830 --> 01:15.830
simple enough.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.560
Let's see what happens now.

01:17.560 --> 01:18.500
Sure enough at work.

01:19.330 --> 01:19.890
Okay.

01:19.990 --> 01:24.510
What about if I would just want the heading One and heading to to be.

01:24.910 --> 01:29.200
Our paragraph should say no no no stay read or something like that.

01:29.320 --> 01:34.140
So let's say the whole body is going to be read but then these two old want to be blue.

01:34.580 --> 01:42.340
Well I can either select them specifically separately so I can say having one and having two or I can

01:42.340 --> 01:43.860
just group them together.

01:43.870 --> 01:46.630
In this case I can just say having one comma.

01:46.720 --> 01:52.040
So that would be the syntax and having two is gonna be in a different color.

01:52.120 --> 01:54.790
In our case let's say that it would be blue.

01:54.820 --> 02:01.360
So I'm gonna again use the color blue and the Mon we say would notice what AB so both of the selectors

02:01.360 --> 02:03.740
that we have if we group them together.

02:03.850 --> 02:07.510
Both of them have the same property we have the same value.

02:07.960 --> 02:12.130
So this is that we can use grouping selectors in C assess.
