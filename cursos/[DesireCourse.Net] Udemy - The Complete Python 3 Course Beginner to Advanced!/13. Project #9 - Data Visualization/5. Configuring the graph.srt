1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,070
Alright, so, we're going to do things a

2

00:00:02,070  -->  00:00:04,650
little bit differently here, and what I

3

00:00:04,650  -->  00:00:06,720
mean by that is before we

4

00:00:06,720  -->  00:00:10,170
were just calling plt.plot, and

5

00:00:10,170  -->  00:00:13,259
then we were showing it, but in this

6

00:00:13,259  -->  00:00:14,460
video we're going to do things a little

7

00:00:14,460  -->  00:00:15,719
bit differently and that's so that we

8

00:00:15,719  -->  00:00:18,600
have more control, and we have access to

9

00:00:18,600  -->  00:00:22,230
more configurations. So what we're

10

00:00:22,230  -->  00:00:23,580
going to do is we're going to put this

11

00:00:23,580  -->  00:00:27,840
into a variable, we're going to

12

00:00:27,840  -->  00:00:30,570
call lines, and then we're going to stuff

13

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:34,200
our x and y-axis into here. So it's

14

00:00:34,200  -->  00:00:37,500
going to be years for the x-axis, and

15

00:00:37,500  -->  00:00:42,180
then pops, and then years again, and then deaths.

16

00:00:42,180  -->  00:00:48,960
Now if I say plt.show I don't think

17

00:00:48,960  -->  00:00:52,050
anything is going to happen, ok, actually

18

00:00:52,050  -->  00:00:54,690
it does show it. Ok, cool, so just by capturing

19

00:00:54,690  -->  00:00:56,940
this it's going to show it, but what we

20

00:00:56,940  -->  00:01:03,629
need to do is we need to, well what we

21

00:01:03,629  -->  00:01:05,100
can do is we can use a different method

22

00:01:05,100  -->  00:01:09,600
here and it's called setp. Where's that?

23

00:01:09,600  -->  00:01:13,560
Here it is. So with this we can actually

24

00:01:13,560  -->  00:01:17,490
use all of these arguments that we can

25

00:01:17,490  -->  00:01:19,799
pass in to really customize how it looks.

26

00:01:19,799  -->  00:01:22,890
So, what I'm going to do is just

27

00:01:22,890  -->  00:01:27,330
something quick before I show you guys.

28

00:01:27,330  -->  00:01:31,110
You can set lines equal to, or lines.

29

00:01:31,110  -->  00:01:34,740
grid(True), and this is going to put a grid

30

00:01:34,740  -->  00:01:38,250
on the background of your graph. It's

31

00:01:38,250  -->  00:01:41,060
actually not going to happen...

32

00:01:42,909  -->  00:01:48,369
and as you can see there's now a grid

33

00:01:48,369  -->  00:01:49,840
background so it makes it easier to

34

00:01:49,840  -->  00:01:53,109
find the coordinates of each line. Now

35

00:01:53,109  -->  00:01:55,090
another thing is that you can actually

36

00:01:55,090  -->  00:02:00,490
put different markers at each point, and

37

00:02:00,490  -->  00:02:01,689
we're going to talk about how to get

38

00:02:01,689  -->  00:02:03,880
the data from each marker as we go along

39

00:02:03,880  -->  00:02:05,289
as well, but for right now what we're

40

00:02:05,289  -->  00:02:08,049
going to do is we're going to use plt.

41

00:02:08,049  -->  00:02:11,290
setp, and in here the first argument is

42

00:02:11,290  -->  00:02:13,120
going to be our lines, and then after

43

00:02:13,120  -->  00:02:14,200
here are going to be any of these

44

00:02:14,200  -->  00:02:16,060
arguments that you see on the left hand side.

45

00:02:16,060  -->  00:02:19,450
So, for for example, we're going to say

46

00:02:19,450  -->  00:02:24,459
color, and we're going to say 1,

47

00:02:24,459  -->  00:02:28,720
.4, .4, and this is going to

48

00:02:28,720  -->  00:02:31,599
make both lines red. I believe we can

49

00:02:31,599  -->  00:02:35,260
also pass a list in here where we define

50

00:02:35,260  -->  00:02:37,599
two different colors, and it will use

51

00:02:37,599  -->  00:02:40,959
them incrementally how we're telling

52

00:02:40,959  -->  00:02:43,299
them to. So .4, .4, and 1,

53

00:02:43,299  -->  00:02:50,579
and no, that's not the case.

54

00:02:57,040  -->  00:03:00,310
Color only works with one color which is

55

00:03:00,310  -->  00:03:05,019
strange, maybe I'm missing something.l

56

00:03:05,019  -->  00:03:08,170
Alright, but what you can do is add markers,

57

00:03:08,170  -->  00:03:12,579
and this is going to take a string,

58

00:03:12,579  -->  00:03:15,189
and it means a difference, so you can use

59

00:03:15,189  -->  00:03:17,739
different symbols in here, and each

60

00:03:17,739  -->  00:03:21,159
symbol is going to be used as the marker

61

00:03:21,159  -->  00:03:26,109
at each point where data is contained.

62

00:03:26,109  -->  00:03:29,620
Now aside from what they show you here, I

63

00:03:29,620  -->  00:03:31,420
mean you can use the period and it puts

64

00:03:31,420  -->  00:03:35,650
a little dot there, so these are the

65

00:03:35,650  -->  00:03:37,359
markers that it shows you, but I have also

66

00:03:37,359  -->  00:03:47,379
found that it can do large circles like

67

00:03:47,379  -->  00:03:52,629
dots, I guess, just by using the letter o,

68

00:03:52,629  -->  00:03:55,030
small letter o, and then run the app and

69

00:03:55,030  -->  00:03:56,829
you'll see that now those points are

70

00:03:56,829  -->  00:04:01,780
larger and easier to see. So, you can also

71

00:04:01,780  -->  00:04:05,319
put, I mean you can configure the

72

00:04:05,319  -->  00:04:10,120
marker size, the market color, marker

73

00:04:10,120  -->  00:04:12,519
width, etc. You can do a lot of things

74

00:04:12,519  -->  00:04:14,260
with this. You can configure the line

75

00:04:14,260  -->  00:04:17,079
style, and I recommend really exploring

76

00:04:17,079  -->  00:04:19,720
these different arguments that you can

77

00:04:19,720  -->  00:04:23,470
pass in to the set p method because

78

00:04:23,470  -->  00:04:24,520
that's going to make things a lot easier

79

00:04:24,520  -->  00:04:28,289
as we go along as well.
