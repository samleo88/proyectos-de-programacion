WEBVTT

00:00.540 --> 00:04.940
As always before we can build anything we would need to do our set up.

00:05.280 --> 00:10.890
So I'm going to go back to my desktop over here and I'm going to create a new folder and I'm going to

00:10.890 --> 00:14.930
create this folder and I'm going to call it code masters or whatever.

00:15.090 --> 00:16.610
And once we have the folder.

00:16.690 --> 00:21.630
Now I'm going to get my text which is going to be brackets like this.

00:21.690 --> 00:26.970
And since I have probably some other folder in here what I'm going to do here all I have to do is actually

00:27.230 --> 00:29.100
only drag this folder on here like this.

00:29.100 --> 00:29.510
Right.

00:29.700 --> 00:34.800
So here it says OK however it's complaining that there's nothing in there and we're going to start over

00:34.800 --> 00:35.090
here.

00:35.090 --> 00:42.310
We're going to send you file and we're going to say next HDMI out like this once we have the next page

00:42.330 --> 00:48.900
the amount we're going to Grabow here a basic full page the Admiral's content on your likeness this

00:49.260 --> 00:54.150
once you're going to have a skeleton let's say or here we're going to say that this is going to be code

00:54.740 --> 00:56.880
masters here.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.170
The language is going to be English here and here you can see that we are getting set up right.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.370
So these are going to be the meta tags.

01:04.380 --> 01:09.930
Now we have a title and now we would need a style sheet and for the style sheet when I'm going to say

01:09.930 --> 01:16.080
that this is going to be a comment and I'm going to say this is going to be Mendes's us and our heroes

01:16.080 --> 01:18.390
is going to write and this is going to be main.

01:18.530 --> 01:26.290
SS Now let's go ahead and let's create actually make us all going to say in your file main CSSA.

01:26.330 --> 01:26.570
Right.

01:26.580 --> 01:33.780
So this is going to be RCF says file Well then once we have a main CSSA now I would want a script file

01:33.990 --> 01:36.440
so I'm going to say we're here this is going to be script.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.540
Yes.

01:37.760 --> 01:38.520
All right.

01:38.640 --> 01:44.750
Once we have a source right so we have script tags and then on here this is going to be source for the

01:44.760 --> 01:46.240
javascript file.

01:46.410 --> 01:52.950
We're going to open up a new file and we're going to say this is going to be script yes or then once

01:52.950 --> 01:58.850
we're actually done with the files let's go here and on top right and when we have the first comment.

01:58.860 --> 02:01.790
This is going to be style main scissors.

02:01.850 --> 02:06.840
Now I would want a Google font's Google fonts over here.

02:06.900 --> 02:12.870
This is going to be our first comment then we're going to have a font on some on here also because with

02:12.870 --> 02:16.840
font awesome 5:0 we're going to put it actually in the head right.

02:16.860 --> 02:24.070
Not when we were actually linking with a C Ss and after that also you'd would want right away for a

02:24.070 --> 02:25.110
Jake worry.

02:25.140 --> 02:29.180
So I'm going to say we're here this is going to be Jake we're like this.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.070
We can save it.

02:30.090 --> 02:36.150
We can actually open up live preview here and we should have actually a blank page right with nothing

02:36.150 --> 02:37.870
showing on this.

02:38.010 --> 02:43.160
And once we have this one we can actually open up or hear Codemasters also in our browser.

02:43.190 --> 02:43.610
Right.

02:43.770 --> 02:46.940
So if you can see that this is going to be a finished project right.

02:47.090 --> 02:53.820
Well we're here to do that and that is all going to create a new browser open right for the page that

02:53.820 --> 02:55.220
we're actually working on.

02:55.280 --> 02:55.510
Right.

02:55.530 --> 02:57.680
And I can just grab it side by side right.

02:57.810 --> 03:00.380
So right away see what we're doing.

03:00.390 --> 03:03.860
So like I said the first thing we need is Google phones.

03:03.990 --> 03:08.360
And as always we just go to Google right and we're going to say or Google Forms.

03:08.370 --> 03:14.640
So once we have the Google fonts like I keep saying all the time for a project I always use something

03:15.380 --> 03:18.720
I don't want to call it like that but I guess funky or something like that.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.940
Right so just a text would stand out.

03:21.040 --> 03:24.950
Now in most cases you probably use something that is popular like that.

03:24.960 --> 03:30.020
A lot of people like right now just what I like for my projects for the fancy center.

03:30.070 --> 03:35.760
Right so I'd suggest looking for a popular search for the popular ones.

03:35.760 --> 03:42.260
And over here let's say on here you can see that it's trending right popular or here data added alphabetical.

03:42.360 --> 03:46.000
And if we go over the popularity you can see that these would be the popular phones right.

03:46.200 --> 03:51.060
Now again what I'm going to do is I'm going to say that this is going to be let's say thickness.

03:51.060 --> 03:55.470
All right we're going to have a little bit of thickness and we're going out also a little bit of slack.

03:55.650 --> 04:02.270
And so since we're out of the sland didn't that didn't work out or I can see these ones I like Why so

04:02.280 --> 04:08.010
long and say we're here and this is what Out went out and we're here they're just right away telling

04:08.010 --> 04:10.400
us how we should add it to our project.

04:10.440 --> 04:16.020
So I'm going to copy this guy over here and then we're going to go back to my quarter over and over

04:16.020 --> 04:22.200
here if this is going to be good fonts we're going to paste new fonts when I say it and we let's go

04:22.200 --> 04:27.200
ahead and let's create a heading one right and I'm going to say hello world.

04:27.250 --> 04:27.530
Right.

04:27.600 --> 04:33.090
And what I would need to do right now is I would need to actually go ahead and have the font family

04:33.610 --> 04:35.860
when I again want to copy this one.

04:35.860 --> 04:37.480
And we're going to go back to Maine.

04:37.490 --> 04:42.630
He says we're going to say that we would want to select whole body copy and pasted.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.060
I can see that I have a hello world.

04:45.060 --> 04:47.750
So the fans are working right now.

04:47.790 --> 04:50.950
After that maybe while we're on the phones right.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.590
While we're still googling everything right.

04:53.790 --> 05:00.250
Let's go back to google more here and we're going to say that this is going to be Jake Querrey CDN write

05:00.340 --> 05:01.440
google CDM.

05:01.570 --> 05:07.210
So right away let's get a J query and we're going to use Jake Wario here for the Stargell button.

05:07.210 --> 05:09.010
So what's going to happen here right.

05:09.010 --> 05:13.610
Once we pressed a button you can see that or hear we're all gonna have a nap.

05:13.810 --> 05:14.230
All right.

05:14.230 --> 05:19.030
And this is going to be a little bit better than the bootstrap one right because all these bars are

05:19.030 --> 05:22.070
actually moving as we're clicking on it right.

05:22.120 --> 05:27.610
So let me again make this maximize this right and then we have all does this damn thing right.

05:27.670 --> 05:34.830
So if we have a Google Cdn or here like this right and we look at that this is going to be Google the

05:34.970 --> 05:39.660
libraries then we find where is our script on here like this.

05:39.760 --> 05:43.250
We're going to copy and paste this when we go back to our texter.

05:43.340 --> 05:48.870
I'm not going to do anything right now and Mansi so I can just close this one on script also right.

05:48.930 --> 05:53.680
And over here you can see where I have a comment for Jake we're going to copy and paste and this is

05:53.680 --> 05:54.870
going to be doing great.

05:55.150 --> 05:59.950
And once we have the script let's say that this is going to be main let's say genius.

05:59.980 --> 06:00.280
Right.

06:00.280 --> 06:05.970
So I'm going to call this script Jack but this is going to mean this is going to be main javascript.

06:05.980 --> 06:06.480
Right.

06:06.790 --> 06:11.740
And what I'm going to do or here and let's say that I'm going to say that this is going to be very simple

06:11.780 --> 06:18.370
and to say alert and you know what to do document ready because then we're going to know that Jake where

06:18.370 --> 06:19.110
he's working.

06:19.330 --> 06:24.790
So I'm going to say we're here selector and so then I'm going to select and I'm going to say for the

06:24.790 --> 06:25.600
whole document.

06:25.610 --> 06:26.040
Right.

06:26.110 --> 06:31.570
So this should run only once the document is going to be ready and I'm going to call it ready function

06:31.790 --> 06:34.470
on here and I'm going to say function.

06:34.470 --> 06:36.520
This is going to be anonymous function.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.670
And over here we're going to write again alert.

06:40.090 --> 06:42.480
Alert.

06:42.880 --> 06:51.070
And we're going to say hello world world order right once we say it we have a hello world here.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.200
So that means our Jake is work.

06:53.310 --> 07:00.630
Because once we download a query we actually have the access here to the function where we can pass

07:00.630 --> 07:02.840
the parameters as a parameter.

07:02.850 --> 07:08.210
I passed a selector for document and this was actually a function already on it.

07:08.250 --> 07:11.920
So this alert is going around only once the document is loaded.

07:12.120 --> 07:18.310
However what I was looking for that if I use this dollars on line this should only work only if my query

07:18.340 --> 07:19.550
is actually loaded.

07:19.590 --> 07:19.990
All right.

07:20.190 --> 07:25.950
So then we can close this one and for now what we can do is get rid of this alert.

07:25.950 --> 07:26.250
Right.

07:26.250 --> 07:30.750
So this is not going to be as annoying but we're all going to do here we're going to write all our code

07:30.750 --> 07:31.680
over here right.

07:31.810 --> 07:36.420
But we would want only our code to run once to actually page is loaded.

07:36.600 --> 07:42.300
So we're going to say this concludes script for now we're going to head back to the next stage.

07:42.310 --> 07:50.020
Now we're going to maybe make these smaller for an hour and so we have way more room to work on this.

07:50.160 --> 07:54.490
And on our next thing that we would want is going to be fun.

07:54.510 --> 07:55.260
Awesome.

07:55.290 --> 07:57.780
So we're here we can close a host of libraries.

07:57.780 --> 07:59.160
We don't need that anymore.

07:59.160 --> 08:02.250
And now we would want a font awesome right here.

08:02.330 --> 08:04.870
The first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to write a way down.

08:04.950 --> 08:05.670
Right.

08:05.700 --> 08:11.990
And again if for the artist projects like we're using the old form awesome right you will go here for

08:11.990 --> 08:14.060
the old 4.7 doctorate.

08:14.250 --> 08:19.280
But since this project I'm recording later right we're going to be using right away four thousand five

08:19.650 --> 08:21.460
so we're going to click on here download.

08:21.620 --> 08:22.030
Right.

08:22.230 --> 08:25.280
And over here again we can go through get started.

08:25.290 --> 08:28.920
Right so what we would need to do know here it's very simple.

08:28.920 --> 08:29.400
Right.

08:29.460 --> 08:32.280
So what they're looking for right is a javascript.

08:32.280 --> 08:36.480
What they're saying is here that they would want a javascript right.

08:36.600 --> 08:40.050
And this is the Cdn that is they're suggesting right.

08:40.140 --> 08:41.940
We don't want CDN.

08:41.970 --> 08:48.280
We already have downloaded a phantasm right now or here this would be the javascript they're suggesting

08:48.320 --> 08:51.550
right font awesome all geus or here right.

08:51.570 --> 08:56.720
And what they're saying is place it over here in the head right in the head element.

08:56.750 --> 09:01.680
So what I'm going to do here I'm going to head back to my downloads here this is going to be.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.490
Awesome.

09:03.720 --> 09:09.420
This is going to open up a folder then we're going to open up this folder one more time then we're going

09:09.420 --> 09:13.340
to look of where it is actually a phone or some.

09:13.410 --> 09:16.960
And if we go back down here or here like this right.

09:17.010 --> 09:19.770
They're actually telling us where it is actually located.

09:19.770 --> 09:20.330
Right.

09:20.370 --> 09:24.150
So this is going to be as 3G with Jay.

09:24.510 --> 09:25.040
Right.

09:25.230 --> 09:31.280
So we have a with genius here and then we have a genius folder.

09:31.530 --> 09:35.160
And then once we have a folder now we want a phone.

09:35.180 --> 09:42.510
Some of us over here and when I'm going to do or here we can just grab this file over here we can close

09:42.510 --> 09:46.450
this now and I'm going to grab it to my folder or here.

09:46.620 --> 09:54.160
Now what I could have done here is create a folder for all my javascript files if there would be more

09:54.160 --> 09:54.820
on them.

09:54.820 --> 09:55.070
All right.

09:55.080 --> 10:01.500
But since I'm going to be placing for a hour curso What are you going to be using or here right.

10:01.530 --> 10:08.820
So we're going to be using a library a square a plugin or here a al curso actually going to place these

10:08.820 --> 10:09.660
fires separately.

10:09.660 --> 10:10.140
Right.

10:10.200 --> 10:16.130
But one of the ways you can actually do it to make your more code more organized is to place the script

10:16.140 --> 10:17.370
just with phantasm.

10:17.370 --> 10:18.600
All right.

10:18.600 --> 10:24.330
Because both of these are javascript files but since this is going to be a smaller project we're not

10:24.330 --> 10:25.450
going to do that.

10:25.500 --> 10:29.850
So we're here or we're going to do is I'm going to head back to my text texter now I can see that I

10:29.850 --> 10:35.860
have my phone some more here read my font on some jazz and what I'm going to say or.

10:35.910 --> 10:38.060
This is going to be script right.

10:38.070 --> 10:40.370
And this is going to be so harsh.

10:40.920 --> 10:45.200
So here we have phantasm ology is what we're going to do.

10:45.220 --> 10:48.160
Here let's try it out with a phantasm jazz.

10:48.360 --> 10:53.910
So I'm going to say this is going to be element f a s more here because that would be the difference

10:53.910 --> 10:54.740
right now right.

10:54.870 --> 10:59.970
With a new version or here and we're going to say this is going to be F.A. home and then we're going

10:59.970 --> 11:03.030
to say F.A. and let's say five acts here.

11:03.210 --> 11:11.010
Press tab now we have a message and once I have the phone line if you're going to go back on here to

11:11.040 --> 11:15.720
the actual font folder you can see or here and once we have downloaded.

11:15.720 --> 11:16.330
Right.

11:16.380 --> 11:20.190
So this is how they would want us to include the script over here.

11:20.430 --> 11:27.260
And if we're actually going to the icons then we can actually see how we need to start working right.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.910
So how to use if this was getting started.

11:30.270 --> 11:37.610
SPG with join hands or here we can go to how to use ones we have a how to use right here.

11:37.740 --> 11:40.020
This is going to be a new syntax right.

11:40.020 --> 11:43.950
So again the so here is now we're actually placing access.

11:44.130 --> 11:48.420
But now we have the yes we actually have few of them.

11:48.420 --> 11:57.930
We have for our this is going to be for the pro here but we also have FHB and this is going to be FHL.

11:57.930 --> 12:03.750
Now again these both are going to be once you're using actually the pro section if you actually buy

12:03.750 --> 12:05.700
the phantasm here.

12:06.030 --> 12:08.730
We're here with brands we can actually use FHB.

12:08.770 --> 12:13.190
So let's say for a Facebook or for Instagram we're going to be using FHB.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.900
So that's going to be it for a phantasm.

12:17.040 --> 12:21.950
So we can close them and then we're going to have a photos right.

12:22.140 --> 12:27.670
And for the photos again we're going to be using a peck sauce or Gratus scruffy.

12:27.740 --> 12:33.870
I mean I would have two choices now I have download the images and the image is going to be attached

12:34.020 --> 12:37.500
with the zip file on it so you can get those images if you want.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.800
If you don't don't want to down yourself.

12:39.990 --> 12:40.550
All right.

12:40.680 --> 12:45.370
So those images are going to be included but I'm just showing you where to get nice images.

12:45.570 --> 12:49.860
And after that we have a logo right here and this guy.

12:49.960 --> 12:55.680
And this is what we're interested and or here if we're going to go to the smaller screen and you can

12:55.680 --> 13:00.200
see maybe this logo on the mirror and it looks like.

13:00.250 --> 13:06.300
And again the logo which is basically going I want to go right and you just right that this is going

13:06.300 --> 13:09.620
to be a free logo like this.

13:09.660 --> 13:14.720
And once we have a free logo you go here and this is going to be free logo design right.

13:14.730 --> 13:21.690
And once you actually open it up over here and you can start choosing what Logos you would want here.

13:21.720 --> 13:29.250
This is going to have you all logos actually going to give you a lot of categories here and let's say

13:29.250 --> 13:31.000
that we can pick something like computer.

13:31.020 --> 13:31.680
Right.

13:31.710 --> 13:36.330
So we're going to pick a computer here the animal going to look you can see that this was an image that

13:36.330 --> 13:38.100
I was using right.

13:38.110 --> 13:40.160
We were we're going to go over here.

13:40.230 --> 13:45.400
We opened up the image but here we're obviously able to change colors.

13:45.540 --> 13:47.950
All right so you're not limited to these colors.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.630
So if I say or here if I start selecting right you can see that I have an option of where I would want

13:54.630 --> 13:57.840
to change the color right now it wouldn't be totally white right.

13:57.840 --> 14:01.330
And again we can go on for probably half an hour right.

14:01.470 --> 14:06.730
But I'm going to let you explore how you would want to make your images yourself right.

14:06.930 --> 14:12.500
But the moment you actually get done with the car you know everything right you can click or hearsay.

14:12.780 --> 14:15.600
Then they are going to save the logo for you.

14:15.600 --> 14:20.900
Then they basically ask you your e-mail and so you have these options.

14:20.920 --> 14:24.010
You this is going to be lower resolution this is going to be free.

14:24.170 --> 14:28.060
Obviously these are already a options for money right.

14:28.190 --> 14:29.860
Thirty nine and 129.

14:30.030 --> 14:35.670
And if I say we're here and this would be my logo I'm going to say we're here now and then I need to

14:35.670 --> 14:37.650
write my e-mail address.

14:37.650 --> 14:39.140
Let's say first name here.

14:39.330 --> 14:40.900
Then they send you a link.

14:40.920 --> 14:45.240
You go back to that link and you're actually down in automatically the moment you open up that link.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.070
Your logo is going to be down.

14:47.220 --> 14:47.570
Right.

14:47.580 --> 14:49.600
So that's how we can get the logo.

14:49.830 --> 14:55.160
And then after that let's do a last thing we would want to do is actually look at the colors right.

14:55.160 --> 15:00.630
Again I'm going to include the colors so I'm just showing you where you can actually find good color

15:00.630 --> 15:02.180
options if you want.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.870
So here I'm going to say of course right.

15:04.990 --> 15:07.940
And this is going to be my first option over here.

15:08.130 --> 15:10.270
And again this is going to be super fast right.

15:10.290 --> 15:12.990
We can start a generator for free right.

15:13.230 --> 15:20.250
And the only thing we need to remember is that we need to press a space bar to get new options.

15:20.250 --> 15:26.130
And if we want to lock anything right we just break this lock and we'll just keep looking for whatever

15:26.130 --> 15:27.580
colors would match or here.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.080
Right.

15:28.320 --> 15:33.900
So this would be the way how we can actually do this right now and once we're done with the colors we're

15:33.900 --> 15:38.330
pretty much done with the set up and we're ready to start working on our project.
