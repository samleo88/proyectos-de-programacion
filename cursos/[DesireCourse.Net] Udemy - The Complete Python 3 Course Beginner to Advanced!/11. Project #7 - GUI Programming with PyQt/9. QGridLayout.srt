1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,709
Alright guys, so what we're going to do

2

00:00:01,709  -->  00:00:04,470
is as with our other videos that we've

3

00:00:04,470  -->  00:00:06,750
done with qt so far we're going to

4

00:00:06,750  -->  00:00:11,130
create an internal method, an instance

5

00:00:11,130  -->  00:00:13,620
variable of the application object that

6

00:00:13,620  -->  00:00:15,450
were creating, and we're going to

7

00:00:15,450  -->  00:00:18,330
initialize the entire application from

8

00:00:18,330  -->  00:00:20,039
within this method rather than the

9

00:00:20,039  -->  00:00:22,230
initialization method. So let's go ahead and

10

00:00:22,230  -->  00:00:30,390
def CreateApp. Alright, and then in

11

00:00:30,390  -->  00:00:32,669
the init function here let's run

12

00:00:32,669  -->  00:00:38,700
self.CreateApp. Now a few videos ago I

13

00:00:38,700  -->  00:00:40,860
talked about different layouts, so we

14

00:00:40,860  -->  00:00:43,559
talked about the vertical layout and the

15

00:00:43,559  -->  00:00:45,930
horizontal layout, but what we didn't talk

16

00:00:45,930  -->  00:00:47,969
about specifically because we're going

17

00:00:47,969  -->  00:00:50,579
to be creating it now is the grid layout.

18

00:00:50,579  -->  00:00:52,770
So I'm going to go ahead and create a

19

00:00:52,770  -->  00:00:59,340
variable called grid, and it's going to

20

00:00:59,340  -->  00:01:06,000
be equal to QGridLayout. Now, I'm going

21

00:01:06,000  -->  00:01:09,330
to create a few buttons here and I'm

22

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:10,830
going to put them in here just to show

23

00:01:10,830  -->  00:01:15,030
you guys how you can use the

24

00:01:15,030  -->  00:01:17,310
QGridLayout. So let's go ahead and create

25

00:01:17,310  -->  00:01:19,650
button1, and it's going to be equal to

26

00:01:19,650  -->  00:01:26,400
QPushButton and it's going to say "One."

27

00:01:26,400  -->  00:01:29,790
Button2 is going to say Q, I'm not sure why

28

00:01:29,790  -->  00:01:31,770
I just unindented there but don't do

29

00:01:31,770  -->  00:01:33,329
that,

30

00:01:33,329  -->  00:01:41,369
QPushButton and it's going say "Two." And then button3 is going to say

31

00:01:41,369  -->  00:01:47,579
QPushButton "Three." And let's go ahead and

32

00:01:47,579  -->  00:01:54,750
create another QPushButton and it's

33

00:01:54,750  -->  00:01:59,310
going to say "My last button." So I'm going to

34

00:01:59,310  -->  00:02:01,740
save this, if we run it now nothing is

35

00:02:01,740  -->  00:02:03,060
going to happen

36

00:02:03,060  -->  00:02:04,590
let's just run the application, and we will see

37

00:02:04,590  -->  00:02:06,479
that we don't see anything yet because

38

00:02:06,479  -->  00:02:09,780
we haven't told the application to use

39

00:02:09,780  -->  00:02:12,209
the grid layout, and even if we did we

40

00:02:12,209  -->  00:02:13,590
didn't tell the buttons

41

00:02:13,590  -->  00:02:15,629
to go into the grid. So we're going

42

00:02:15,629  -->  00:02:19,769
to do that now, and how we do that is by

43

00:02:19,769  -->  00:02:25,110
going grid.addWidget and this is

44

00:02:25,110  -->  00:02:26,910
going to take a few parameters.

45

00:02:26,910  -->  00:02:31,500
The first one is going to be the object

46

00:02:31,500  -->  00:02:33,599
itself that we're adding, so in this case

47

00:02:33,599  -->  00:02:37,530
it's going to be button1. Now

48

00:02:37,530  -->  00:02:40,049
there's four more parameters, and I'm

49

00:02:40,049  -->  00:02:41,400
just going to type them out and say them,

50

00:02:41,400  -->  00:02:45,959
then I'll explain a bit. So this is row, this

51

00:02:45,959  -->  00:02:48,569
column, this is rows, and this is columns.

52

00:02:48,569  -->  00:02:52,440
So, this is going to say that it occupies 0

53

00:02:52,440  -->  00:02:56,670
rows and it occupies 0 columns, so it's

54

00:02:56,670  -->  00:02:58,530
not going to show it all. This is the

55

00:02:58,530  -->  00:03:00,599
row numbe, so as with programming

56

00:03:00,599  -->  00:03:03,540
the row numbers start with 0, so this is

57

00:03:03,540  -->  00:03:07,290
0, 1, 2, 3. As you can see in my code editor

58

00:03:07,290  -->  00:03:09,690
here there are four rows labeled

59

00:03:09,690  -->  00:03:15,209
0-3. We want to put this in the

60

00:03:15,209  -->  00:03:18,269
first row and in the first column. So,

61

00:03:18,269  -->  00:03:20,700
let's say these are columns there's

62

00:03:20,700  -->  00:03:28,799
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, so there's seven columns on each

63

00:03:28,799  -->  00:03:31,769
row here so 0, 0 is going to be right

64

00:03:31,769  -->  00:03:32,459
there.

65

00:03:32,459  -->  00:03:34,530
Now we need to tell it how many rows it

66

00:03:34,530  -->  00:03:36,480
is going to take up, it's going to be one row and one column.

67

00:03:36,480  -->  00:03:40,620
one row and one column. So think about

68

00:03:40,620  -->  00:03:44,549
this as it's pacing. I'm just going to go

69

00:03:44,549  -->  00:03:47,730
ahead and self.setLayout we're going to

70

00:03:47,730  -->  00:03:50,280
set the layout right now to grid, and

71

00:03:50,280  -->  00:03:52,260
then show it, and then I'm going to show

72

00:03:52,260  -->  00:03:55,889
you guys the application so far. As you

73

00:03:55,889  -->  00:03:59,910
can see there is one grid item there. The

74

00:03:59,910  -->  00:04:02,280
grid magically grows and shrinks to

75

00:04:02,280  -->  00:04:04,290
accommodate how much space it needs, so I'm

76

00:04:04,290  -->  00:04:05,579
going to show you guys that. What we're

77

00:04:05,579  -->  00:04:07,950
going to do is go ahead and add another

78

00:04:07,950  -->  00:04:12,569
widget here, so we're going to have the

79

00:04:12,569  -->  00:04:15,660
second button on the first row in the

80

00:04:15,660  -->  00:04:17,400
second column, and it's going to take up

81

00:04:17,400  -->  00:04:20,400
one and one. So I'm going to save this and run

82

00:04:20,400  -->  00:04:21,900
it again, and you're going to see that

83

00:04:21,900  -->  00:04:25,969
now the row is split into two.

84

00:04:26,100  -->  00:04:29,400
I'm going to go ahead and add the third

85

00:04:29,400  -->  00:04:36,120
button here, on the first row, in the

86

00:04:36,120  -->  00:04:38,430
third column, and it's going to take up one

87

00:04:38,430  -->  00:04:42,450
and one. And then I'm going to add the

88

00:04:42,450  -->  00:04:48,840
fourth button, it's going to be on row

89

00:04:48,840  -->  00:04:52,200
two, in position one, and it's going to

90

00:04:52,200  -->  00:04:57,120
take up one row and two columns, and

91

00:04:57,120  -->  00:04:58,710
you're going to see how this is going to

92

00:04:58,710  -->  00:05:01,170
look just based on that.

93

00:05:01,170  -->  00:05:05,640
So, if we look at our grid we see two

94

00:05:05,640  -->  00:05:08,340
rows as we have defined in the first

95

00:05:08,340  -->  00:05:11,100
parameter after each object that we're

96

00:05:11,100  -->  00:05:13,650
adding. So the first parameter after that that

97

00:05:13,650  -->  00:05:16,200
were sending is the row. First row

98

00:05:16,200  -->  00:05:19,050
and second row right there, or row 0 and

99

00:05:19,050  -->  00:05:23,010
row 1. This is the column, so the first

100

00:05:23,010  -->  00:05:25,440
column, second column, and third column

101

00:05:25,440  -->  00:05:28,110
are these, and then on the second row we

102

00:05:28,110  -->  00:05:30,660
actually see that this one takes up two

103

00:05:30,660  -->  00:05:33,960
columns and that's because the final

104

00:05:33,960  -->  00:05:35,730
parameter here, the number of columns

105

00:05:35,730  -->  00:05:39,090
that it takes up, is set to 2. If I set that

106

00:05:39,090  -->  00:05:44,790
to 3 and reran our application here, you'll

107

00:05:44,790  -->  00:05:47,490
see that it takes up all of the space. So

108

00:05:47,490  -->  00:05:49,050
that's an important concept as well, it's

109

00:05:49,050  -->  00:05:50,880
basically just understanding how you

110

00:05:50,880  -->  00:05:55,910
pack the grid within qt.
