00:00.200 --> 00:01.350
All righty then.

00:01.350 --> 00:03.700
By now we know that images are important.

00:04.480 --> 00:08.940
However what's also important for every webpage is to have some kind of link.

00:09.720 --> 00:14.820
Now that would be a navigation link when we were all going to be navigating throughout a project that

00:14.820 --> 00:20.600
could be the link within the actual single page or it can be also the external link.

00:20.700 --> 00:24.990
So let's say our user can visit I don't know Facebook or Google or whatever.

00:25.230 --> 00:27.610
Some kind of external information.

00:27.810 --> 00:33.930
Now as you can see right away I did some spring cleaning here because I usually like my tutorial screens

00:33.960 --> 00:39.870
kind of just bare minimum because I think it's just gonna help us all if we're not going to clutter

00:39.870 --> 00:40.870
here now.

00:40.910 --> 00:45.060
So it's a different status scenario when we're all going to be working on the project because there's

00:45.060 --> 00:51.780
gonna be tons of information but for tutorial I always like to have it as clean as possible.

00:51.780 --> 00:55.200
Now what about the links we can create links in an HMO.

00:55.890 --> 00:57.320
Well we already know the deal.

00:57.320 --> 00:58.020
Right.

00:58.050 --> 01:02.640
We need to have some kind of tags and then we're going to place the link within the tag.

01:02.640 --> 01:07.020
Now what that would be for the link what would be the element name now for the link.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.090
I'm going to use a.

01:08.250 --> 01:15.130
And sure enough right away we're going to have our link available now within the link tags and this

01:15.130 --> 01:16.810
is where we will write the text.

01:16.810 --> 01:22.450
So let's say visit you Demi for more information.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.510
Now as you can see this one came out really a long link.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.620
And sure enough now I have my link.

01:27.790 --> 01:30.290
Now what's gonna happen once I click this link.

01:30.310 --> 01:31.500
Well let's think about it.

01:31.810 --> 01:34.640
If I'm gonna click on it where I'm gonna go.

01:34.870 --> 01:37.410
So I click on it and nothing happens.

01:37.620 --> 01:37.950
Okay.

01:37.960 --> 01:43.330
The reason why nothing happens is because we also need to fill out the H refer attribute which comes

01:43.330 --> 01:47.410
right away with Emmet because they are doing all the work for us.

01:47.470 --> 01:52.930
So if we would manually be creating this obviously we would have to write the H if attribute ourselves.

01:52.990 --> 02:00.730
Now the HCF attribute tells us where the user or whoever clicks on this link is gonna be navigating

02:00.730 --> 02:01.700
to.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.140
So here we will need to write the URL.

02:04.150 --> 02:10.060
Now here we can just say h the G.P.S. s and then the whole deal more if you don't want to make mistakes

02:10.120 --> 02:15.820
or maybe you don't know the full you are all maybe it's really long you can just head over to whatever

02:15.820 --> 02:17.630
you are all you're searching for.

02:17.740 --> 02:19.470
Which in my case would be you Demi.

02:19.540 --> 02:26.470
So I can just copy and paste this and we can head over back to the issue of and paste it within the

02:26.800 --> 02:28.140
quotation marks.

02:28.180 --> 02:34.780
And now once I say it then the user should be available or users should be able to go to them.

02:34.800 --> 02:35.710
So as I click on it.

02:35.710 --> 02:39.830
Notice now we're navigating to Udemy page.

02:39.830 --> 02:45.370
Now there is one thing though you probably don't want user to leave your site because at this moment

02:45.380 --> 02:50.350
notice we went to Demi but we left the site that we were currently on.

02:50.350 --> 02:57.100
So maybe it's better if we would add the attribute and then attribute name is target and we would need

02:57.100 --> 03:00.910
to set this to blank so underscore blank.

03:00.940 --> 03:02.280
So this would be the value.

03:02.380 --> 03:04.040
Now in this case what's going to happen.

03:04.040 --> 03:09.460
And first of all I would need to navigate back and what I would like to do right now with Target blank

03:09.910 --> 03:14.140
is whenever a user is going to click on a link instead of navigating.

03:14.140 --> 03:18.040
And this didn't happen because I needed to refresh probably or something like that.

03:18.430 --> 03:19.570
So I have target blank.

03:19.570 --> 03:21.270
Visit you Demi for more.

03:21.350 --> 03:22.300
Everything is saved.

03:22.360 --> 03:29.440
And sure enough now once I click on a link instead of navigating away from the site that the users currently

03:29.440 --> 03:33.900
on we're opening up the link in the new browser tab.

03:34.030 --> 03:40.120
So this probably should be a better option especially with an external ones where we are adding this

03:40.120 --> 03:44.680
target attribute as well as we're setting in equal to black.
