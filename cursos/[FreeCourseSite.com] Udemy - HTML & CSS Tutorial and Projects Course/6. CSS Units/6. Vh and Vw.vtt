00:00.360 --> 00:06.420
My absolute favorite units in the C Ss have to be view height and view with and the reason for that

00:06.480 --> 00:09.740
is because you can make really cool banners like this.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.450
Now how are they going to work.

00:11.460 --> 00:14.240
Well first and foremost they are going to be again relative.

00:14.620 --> 00:17.900
How are they all gonna be relative to a screen.

00:17.970 --> 00:22.140
So whatever you're seeing right now everything is gonna be relative to that.

00:22.170 --> 00:27.420
Now what that means is that even though we're gonna be changing the screen size they're also gonna change

00:27.420 --> 00:29.680
their dimensions depending on that.

00:29.720 --> 00:31.170
So how this is gonna work.

00:31.290 --> 00:34.290
Well as always we're going to head over to indexation hymnal.

00:34.470 --> 00:36.460
We're gonna get rid of some of these suckers.

00:36.460 --> 00:39.600
We don't need them and we're going to go first with the dev.

00:39.740 --> 00:45.450
A class is gonna be an unknown let's call this banner and then let's copy and paste it and instead of

00:45.450 --> 00:47.190
the banner we're going to call this header.

00:47.220 --> 00:51.640
Again it doesn't really matter what your color class is it's for testing anyway.

00:51.970 --> 00:52.380
Okay.

00:52.410 --> 00:53.300
So far so good.

00:53.310 --> 00:57.270
So we have our two days and then let me also delete these guys.

00:57.270 --> 00:58.680
We don't need them as well.

00:58.690 --> 01:00.780
Now let's start first with one.

01:00.840 --> 01:01.630
Let's see what we have.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.300
First it was the banner.

01:03.370 --> 01:05.480
Okay so we're selecting the class of banner.

01:05.700 --> 01:11.520
And now I'd like to use let's say 50 and in my case I House need to go with 51.

01:11.940 --> 01:17.340
Well I'm going to say with 50 with is going to be in my case I don't know view with.

01:17.650 --> 01:22.970
Now the reason for it again for the with we would have to use view width or height.

01:22.980 --> 01:24.520
We're gonna have to use you height.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.440
So we have the with.

01:26.580 --> 01:27.220
What about the height.

01:27.840 --> 01:31.610
Let's also say new heights and then let's check it out again.

01:31.620 --> 01:33.600
Background is going to be right.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.360
Now no something interesting.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.070
Don't pay attention please again.

01:37.090 --> 01:41.820
There's gonna be some margins that we're getting from default browser styles but what's happening is

01:41.880 --> 01:46.740
we're getting 50 percent of the screen horizontally as well as vertically.

01:46.740 --> 01:52.470
Now if I'm gonna make my screen size bigger it's not gonna change again depending on a screen size.

01:52.500 --> 01:57.540
This is still gonna be 50 percent horizontally and 50 percent vertically.

01:57.540 --> 01:58.420
Don't leave me.

01:58.430 --> 02:00.320
Let's start out with another guy.

02:00.450 --> 02:05.550
Let's say that there's going to be header and the header is gonna be and I'm not again with.

02:05.550 --> 02:10.770
And we can again use any kind of values I'm just using the round values because they kind of make a

02:10.770 --> 02:11.910
little bit more sense.

02:12.060 --> 02:14.300
Let's make up and paste it in this case.

02:14.310 --> 02:21.610
I don't want to with I want to hide and in my case the height is gonna be a hundred view height and

02:21.760 --> 02:23.340
we will gonna use this a lot.

02:23.350 --> 02:26.030
Every time we're working with the banners.

02:26.230 --> 02:31.750
So every time we're gonna be making some kind of banners like this we will gonna use these values or

02:31.750 --> 02:32.800
these units.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.520
Now let me add one more thing.

02:34.750 --> 02:38.560
And let's say a background is gonna be blue.

02:38.650 --> 02:43.320
Now this is gonna be harder to see right away because no this will kind of have to scroll.

02:43.510 --> 02:45.380
So you might be like well wait a minute.

02:45.390 --> 02:48.160
This is not exactly a hundred percent.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.350
And this is not gonna be hundred viewers okay.

02:51.490 --> 02:52.950
I guess you don't believe me.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.210
Well let's test it out.

02:54.230 --> 02:56.460
No you don't have to write this code right now.

02:56.470 --> 03:01.840
We will gonna cover this a little bit later but I'm basically gonna do it like a little reset and I'm

03:01.840 --> 03:04.180
gonna do this with properties we haven't covered yet.

03:04.210 --> 03:05.890
So again please don't freak out.

03:05.890 --> 03:07.470
We will gonna cover them later.

03:07.630 --> 03:09.940
So let's say first I'm gonna say margin zero.

03:09.970 --> 03:11.600
And by the way you don't have to do this.

03:11.710 --> 03:15.400
I'm just doing it just so you can see that it's really happening.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.290
Then the padding is gonna be zero.

03:17.290 --> 03:22.610
And we're also gonna have box sizing to a broader box so something like this.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.940
Now what happens.

03:23.980 --> 03:26.500
You can see that this is exactly right now.

03:26.500 --> 03:31.060
Hundred percent horizontally as well as 100 percent vertically.

03:31.060 --> 03:31.780
And you know what.

03:31.810 --> 03:35.170
Let me do one last thing and let's flip them over.

03:35.260 --> 03:38.860
Let's say that we're going to be looking first for the header and then the banner.

03:38.950 --> 03:42.000
So as you start scrolling This is gonna be a hundred percent.

03:42.070 --> 03:43.720
So the moment loads.

03:43.720 --> 03:48.270
This is exactly my height and with the screen at the moment scrolling.

03:48.370 --> 03:52.780
This is where I'm getting to my next time and this right now is gonna be 50 percent.

03:52.780 --> 03:55.270
Now if I'm gonna make again my screen size bigger.

03:55.420 --> 03:59.520
This guy obviously is gonna work we have 50 percent of the screen.

03:59.620 --> 04:03.590
So again they are really really cool values or unit.

04:03.730 --> 04:05.400
They're all gonna use them quite a lot.

04:05.410 --> 04:09.930
Every time we're going to be working with the banner but also you can use for many other things.

04:10.030 --> 04:14.890
And what it allows you to do is not to use some kind of tax or anything like that dealing with percentages

04:15.190 --> 04:15.730
instead.

04:15.730 --> 04:17.580
Again you're just using the screen.

04:17.710 --> 04:23.800
You're saying hey listen give me 25 percent of the screen give me seventy five percent give me 10 percent.

04:23.800 --> 04:24.790
It doesn't matter.

04:24.910 --> 04:29.500
You're working with the screen so every time you're going to be working depending on different screen

04:29.500 --> 04:30.070
size.

04:30.310 --> 04:32.680
He didn't get to perform exactly the same way.
