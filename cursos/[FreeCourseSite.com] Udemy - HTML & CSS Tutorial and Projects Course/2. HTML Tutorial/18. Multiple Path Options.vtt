00:00.330 --> 00:05.370
Even though everything is displayed correctly in the life server if Logan tried to run this with the

00:05.370 --> 00:06.090
browser.

00:06.120 --> 00:11.150
So first of all let me open up the browser window and of course it has to be massive right away.

00:11.580 --> 00:16.350
And let's say that we're going to look for our file which in our case is going to be next session email

00:16.830 --> 00:18.800
notice that we're not gonna see the image.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.120
So we're getting this alter text.

00:21.210 --> 00:26.740
Now the reason for that because filesystem is giving you a lot of hustle because of this warrants.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.060
Now I know we haven't covered yet the comments in Asian email and we're gonna do that in few videos

00:33.420 --> 00:36.910
but let me just first of all copy and paste this two more times.

00:37.050 --> 00:41.990
And let me just show you what other options you have for getting the image.

00:42.090 --> 00:47.370
Now first and foremost as you can see I actually made a mess a little bit because I didn't want more

00:47.370 --> 00:48.390
of them here.

00:48.390 --> 00:50.100
Let's start with a simple one.

00:50.100 --> 00:54.060
Now alternatively we could just write like this without a forward slash.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.350
And once we save it.

00:55.540 --> 01:01.460
Notice in the life server everything is going to be displayed correctly as well as in the file system.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.480
So if I'm going to refresh it check this out.

01:04.020 --> 01:08.350
So now we have a nice image and also we have another option.

01:08.370 --> 01:12.780
So let me copy and paste this line and let's comment now the previous one.

01:12.780 --> 01:16.220
We have an option of having the dot and then the forwards.

01:16.560 --> 01:21.510
And again this is going to do the same thing where I can say with everything is gonna be displayed correctly

01:21.540 --> 01:27.130
on a life server as well it's going to work in a browser because as you can see once I refresh there

01:27.140 --> 01:31.280
is no errors or in our case just there is no alternative text.

01:31.280 --> 01:37.160
Now your question probably would be well if we can use this guy why are we using these forward slashes

01:37.170 --> 01:38.170
and these dots.

01:38.400 --> 01:44.520
And the reason for that is even though I don't like to throw a lot of things in the beginning eventually

01:44.640 --> 01:51.960
the more web development you do and as you're going to start progressing with node or BHP or let's say

01:51.960 --> 01:58.180
I don't know react you gonna see a lot of these relative path where you have dot and then you have forward

01:58.180 --> 02:03.960
slash so that would mean that this is in the same directory or you're gonna see two dots which would

02:03.960 --> 02:09.060
mean that this would be in the actual folder maybe outside the directory.

02:09.300 --> 02:12.510
And the point of this is for you to get used to the syntax.

02:12.510 --> 02:15.930
So later on once you see it you're not like deer in the headlights you know.

02:15.940 --> 02:20.490
Okay so this means that this would be in the same directory and then two that are going to mean that

02:20.730 --> 02:26.490
if it's outside the directory now we're gonna cover two dots later on as we're working with CSX because

02:26.490 --> 02:30.590
a lot of times CSX is not going to be in the same folder as the indexation email.

02:30.630 --> 02:32.700
So I'm not going to cover that right now.

02:32.700 --> 02:38.250
Just please remember that if you would like to open up in the file system you can use one of these two

02:38.250 --> 02:44.100
options and it's gonna be displayed correctly however throughout my project I will gonna use this dot

02:44.100 --> 02:48.180
syntax because I think it's gonna make a lot of sense in the long run.

02:48.210 --> 02:51.510
So you are very used to the syntax once you progressed to that stage.
