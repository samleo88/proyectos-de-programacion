WEBVTT

00:00.140 --> 00:06.180
Announce that we are in a sea of stress the first thing that we want to do is we will want to apply

00:06.330 --> 00:14.330
more here to all the elements that we're going to have a padding zero margins here like this.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.840
Then after that we're going to target a body.

00:17.100 --> 00:22.440
So we're going to say Behati and for the whole body we're still going to do a background and we're going

00:22.440 --> 00:24.440
to do this whitish color.

00:24.450 --> 00:26.760
Here is a background.

00:27.150 --> 00:27.740
All right.

00:27.750 --> 00:33.680
Hash tag EF 5 EF 3 5 0 here.

00:33.810 --> 00:36.740
Then after that we would want actual fun family.

00:36.960 --> 00:37.330
Right.

00:37.350 --> 00:42.200
Because you can see or hear read I do have the Google font.

00:42.200 --> 00:42.800
Right.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.020
The robot on.

00:44.170 --> 00:48.410
However you can see over here that I haven't actually included them right.

00:48.450 --> 00:51.810
So here I'm going to say font family here.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.090
They're all going to place here in quotation marks.

00:55.090 --> 00:58.860
Are going to write a robot go like this.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.080
We're going to place a comma.

01:00.180 --> 01:03.710
This is going to be Sounds sort of like this.

01:03.820 --> 01:05.370
Now we have the fonts.

01:05.400 --> 01:08.940
The next one would want to hear this on our list.

01:08.940 --> 01:09.520
All right.

01:09.590 --> 01:14.080
I actually want to get rid of these annoying little dots right.

01:14.080 --> 01:16.740
That usually comes with Wunderlist.

01:16.740 --> 01:21.810
Now you can see them right now because we got the margins and paddings but believe me they're still

01:21.810 --> 01:22.620
there.

01:22.620 --> 01:27.460
So here's what I'm going to say is going to be Nav. here on her list.

01:27.530 --> 01:28.290
All right.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.290
This is going to be a list style type.

01:31.290 --> 01:33.970
None right now no more now.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.880
Well now we don't have them right now.

01:35.900 --> 01:41.460
We got rid of those bullet points and then we're actually right away going to head or here and start

01:41.460 --> 01:42.830
working with these links.

01:43.110 --> 01:49.080
So I'm going to say we're here now have an ordered list please turn them on here.

01:49.180 --> 01:51.920
And this is going to be like what I would want.

01:52.060 --> 01:54.450
First I'm going to set text decoration.

01:54.620 --> 01:55.590
I'm going to say none.

01:55.690 --> 01:56.240
Right.

01:56.300 --> 02:01.550
So this is going to get rid of all of this there then after that we're going to see this play block

02:02.140 --> 02:02.680
here.

02:02.900 --> 02:08.150
And the reason for this playbook is because first of all we would want them to actually take the whole

02:08.150 --> 02:09.230
space.

02:09.320 --> 02:14.810
You know there's an alternate would want as we're actually hovering right you can see that as I'm hovering

02:14.810 --> 02:17.360
right this is still a link.

02:17.420 --> 02:22.960
So before that there were actually only one or you are just hovering over the actual text.

02:22.980 --> 02:26.520
Right now if I'm hovering anywhere this is going to work.

02:26.870 --> 02:32.210
Then once we have the display block we're going to have a caller and we're going to use the car.

02:32.350 --> 02:40.190
So I'm going to say F F C and this is going to be 9 1 for it and our get real color.

02:40.340 --> 02:46.380
Then after that we would want a background for background we're going to go with a black one is going

02:46.430 --> 02:49.710
to be too easy to not.

02:49.760 --> 02:54.800
After that we're going to have eight to eight to nobody.

02:55.430 --> 02:58.640
So you can see this is going to be our black background.

02:58.640 --> 03:02.520
And after that I would want a transition and font size.

03:02.780 --> 03:09.990
So we're going to say we're here font size and this is going to be 20 pixels like this.

03:10.280 --> 03:17.170
And then we're going to have a transition no real transition we're going to say or hair color and background.

03:17.420 --> 03:24.800
And basically what I'm saying is that I'm going to be adding one more over here a rule right as when

03:24.800 --> 03:26.290
I'm actually hovering right.

03:26.660 --> 03:29.970
But as I'm hovering I actually don't want it to happen right away.

03:30.050 --> 03:32.250
I don't want it to happen right away instantly.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.830
Therefore I'm going to be using that transition property right.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.460
And here I need to set the out.

03:37.620 --> 03:43.340
So first I'm going to say that AOD which properties I would want to affect my so I'm going to say first

03:43.370 --> 03:46.710
caller I'm going to say two seconds.

03:46.740 --> 03:49.070
He's on this.

03:49.130 --> 03:56.810
I went over to say two seconds we're going to say he's right and easy basically means how this transition

03:56.810 --> 03:57.720
is going to happen right.

03:57.740 --> 04:04.040
Whether it's going to start fast run fast and ease in out usually is a default All right.

04:04.130 --> 04:09.680
So we can just say ease ease in out here.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.510
That's right.

04:10.550 --> 04:11.380
Easy now.

04:11.420 --> 04:12.480
Or we can just write.

04:12.550 --> 04:14.060
It doesn't really matter.

04:14.090 --> 04:18.100
And on here we can have a background we say background.

04:18.350 --> 04:19.990
That's going to be the second property.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.240
And again we're going to do two seconds here.

04:22.430 --> 04:27.430
So basically what I'm saying here is how do one effect this property.

04:27.590 --> 04:30.840
I would want Actually this transition to take two seconds.

04:31.060 --> 04:36.140
And usually the reason why I like to have my transition is happening two seconds because I like to actually

04:36.140 --> 04:41.240
show you that it's working right now and is probably going to do something like this right.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.340
You're going to do something like 0.4.

04:43.420 --> 04:46.100
We're going to stick with you here on this.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.370
And then after that want actual properties right.

04:49.440 --> 04:52.410
And before we do that actually I forgot a parting.

04:52.630 --> 04:56.350
So I'm going to say all right padding and I'm going to say 10 pixels really.

04:56.470 --> 04:57.150
Right.

04:57.230 --> 05:04.970
So we added element of padding then on here we're going to say now I have have this and you can see

05:04.970 --> 05:14.570
that the reason my typing is extremely well on my list is I heard him say an hour or hour when magically

05:14.570 --> 05:19.180
what I'm going to say right now I'm going to say color how I'm going to flip them around.

05:19.280 --> 05:23.540
I'm going to say whatever was Blagrove core is going to be the actual font color.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.150
And so I'm going to say copy color.

05:26.450 --> 05:29.240
And here we're going to say background is going to be up.

05:29.430 --> 05:32.910
It's are going to say Magro over here and we're going to use this.

05:33.110 --> 05:40.490
Right now you can see that where I'm getting this transition robery from right that basically with transition

05:40.490 --> 05:45.670
I'm saying which properties I would want to affect and transition is going to be what I'm wearing right.

05:45.680 --> 05:49.000
And these are these are going to be the values that are going to be changing.

05:49.100 --> 05:55.160
So if I save this one in here and actually start hovering all right you can see that transitions are

05:55.160 --> 05:56.980
happening actually over time.

05:57.150 --> 05:57.510
Right.

05:57.630 --> 06:03.420
Not right away as they just hover and right away it turns actually yellow and the text is black red.

06:03.590 --> 06:06.370
So this kind of gives it a little bit nicer.

06:06.710 --> 06:12.650
And once we're done with hovering Let's actually focus over here on this log or here it is going to.

06:12.970 --> 06:19.010
And what we are going to do here is going to find where it is when you say this is going to be nav.

06:19.290 --> 06:23.470
And this is going to be a long go down here are going to say first of all background.

06:23.500 --> 06:23.920
All right.

06:23.960 --> 06:28.770
And again we're going to use a yellow F F C here.

06:28.790 --> 06:32.210
This is going to be nine one for this one.

06:32.210 --> 06:34.200
So again we're going to do the opposite.

06:34.220 --> 06:35.030
This one was black.

06:35.030 --> 06:36.230
This is going to be.

06:36.530 --> 06:44.290
Then after that we would want a padding right padding around say 10 pixels like this.

06:44.300 --> 06:48.710
And over here we would actually want to start using the flex box properly.

06:48.740 --> 06:49.140
Right.

06:49.310 --> 06:55.310
You can see or hear these two items right now logo is the parent for both of them right.

06:55.370 --> 07:01.370
And if I'm going to write on here display when I say flex I can see first of all this got moved all

07:01.370 --> 07:02.310
the way to the top.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.330
But you can see that something changed right.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.730
We actually applied already a flex box.

07:06.950 --> 07:12.920
And after that we're going to say justify content and just content between when this is going to be

07:12.920 --> 07:19.850
content and spaces between what I'm saying you know what just push them as far as way you can from each

07:19.850 --> 07:20.930
other.

07:21.220 --> 07:25.630
And then after that let's work with this guy let's work with a fantastic Maika.

07:26.050 --> 07:29.700
We're going to say a lot now logo.

07:29.810 --> 07:36.290
Basically I want a class right now that I would want a font or some one like this and then I'm going

07:36.290 --> 07:41.990
to say first of all that I would want to place it in the center I'm going to use a Lexmark so I'm going

07:41.990 --> 07:43.410
to say align itself.

07:43.580 --> 07:46.170
I'm going to say Center or here right.

07:46.300 --> 07:50.140
So now I can see right away it sits directly center over here.

07:50.270 --> 07:53.020
Then after that we would want additional padding.

07:53.120 --> 07:57.180
So I'm going to say padding and I'm going to say 10 pixels on this.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.660
So now there's padding around.

07:59.900 --> 08:06.760
And then after that will want a font size and say 25 pixels so the font got bigger.

08:07.010 --> 08:11.780
And after that you're going to have a cursor and I we are going to use pointer right.

08:11.780 --> 08:19.610
So basically what's happening is as I'm going over here this icon right as I'm hovering right you can

08:19.610 --> 08:25.850
see that cursor is going to be changing and this is going to be it for a mobile you.

08:25.930 --> 08:31.880
Right next what we would want to do is actually start applying the media equerries.

08:32.090 --> 08:34.630
So this wouldn't be actually responsive.

08:34.750 --> 08:34.970
Right.

08:34.970 --> 08:36.890
So once we got to the bigger screen right.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.200
This is not going to stay the same.

08:39.260 --> 08:41.590
So I'm going to save this one here like this.

08:41.600 --> 08:46.160
And what we're going to do here we're going to check it out how this looks like.

08:46.400 --> 08:50.920
So again we're going to minimize this open up frozen banana.

08:51.420 --> 08:52.650
We're like this.

08:52.650 --> 08:54.330
I mean I can see that this guy right.

08:54.410 --> 08:59.900
Our index or you know this this actually is going to be all over it too.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.280
You can see where are right.

09:01.310 --> 09:02.360
So doesn't matter.

09:02.380 --> 09:05.150
And the screen says this is going to be appearing like this.

09:05.150 --> 09:05.790
Right.

09:05.810 --> 09:11.110
And you can see also that we still haven't applied any kind of actual inquiry.

09:11.120 --> 09:11.570
Right.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.620
So this would actually fold.

09:13.760 --> 09:13.970
Right.

09:13.970 --> 09:19.080
So this business right now is not working we can click all we want doesn't really change.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.810
So let's go to this.

09:20.990 --> 09:24.500
And let's actually start applying the responsiveness.
