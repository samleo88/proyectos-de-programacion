00:00.090 --> 00:00.870
Excellent.

00:00.900 --> 00:07.320
We now know how to implement basic age the amount document structure our live server is working correctly

00:07.670 --> 00:14.770
and we are good to go and start actually working more with a Schimmel meaning learning more HDMI element.

00:14.820 --> 00:20.880
However before we do that let me quickly show you two very important things that are going to come very

00:20.880 --> 00:24.740
beneficial as well going to be working with HDMI elements.

00:24.750 --> 00:27.690
Now first of all I would like to talk about the word wrap.

00:27.870 --> 00:33.120
As you notice since we have the paragraph and it's quite a long and let's say if I'm going to be adding

00:33.510 --> 00:38.190
more here exclamation marks and I'm gonna say with everything isn't going to be displayed nicely in

00:38.190 --> 00:39.060
the page.

00:39.070 --> 00:41.940
However notice what happens with our actual text.

00:42.430 --> 00:47.640
So now I need to start scrolling left and right and you can say well you can always do mark right.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.100
So I can keep zooming out.

00:49.110 --> 00:51.830
However what if we're gonna be adding more text here.

00:52.030 --> 00:56.310
That's not gonna make sense because then basically we're going to have to make it really small.

00:56.310 --> 01:01.440
And first of all I've heard of the tutorial and it's gonna be very hard for you to see as well as in

01:01.440 --> 01:03.420
general whenever you're going to be working.

01:03.450 --> 01:05.010
This is not going to make sense.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.870
So what would be the solution.

01:06.870 --> 01:09.600
Well again we're going to have to go back to the settings.

01:09.740 --> 01:14.290
I'm going to click on a cog and then we'll look for the setting of the word wrap.

01:14.930 --> 01:19.740
So let me find this and then you're going to have this control how lines should wrap.

01:20.010 --> 01:22.970
And here in this case we just need to say that this would be OK.

01:23.100 --> 01:27.240
So instead of off that was there before most are going to go off or on.

01:27.240 --> 01:28.350
Now what's gonna happen again.

01:28.350 --> 01:33.880
This is going to auto save right away and we can just see that in a text that are right now.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.530
This is gonna wrap the line.

01:35.640 --> 01:41.070
And again this will you make your life easier because you will not going to have to scroll left and

01:41.070 --> 01:42.750
right as well as zoom out.

01:43.200 --> 01:49.480
So now whenever you're going to have a longer line this is just going to wrap into a new line now.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.750
Next I would like to talk about Emmett.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.860
No one in the world is them.

01:53.910 --> 01:58.700
You see Emmett is something that speeds up your rage the amount workflow.

01:58.780 --> 02:02.380
Now if you're using different texture you can still access them.

02:03.010 --> 02:07.380
However in the Visual Studio code it is built in.

02:07.420 --> 02:12.670
Now again if you would like to have a little bit more information about Emmett you can head over again

02:12.670 --> 02:18.490
in the Google and just type Emmett and you'll see that this is essential tool for window shop where

02:18.490 --> 02:20.850
we can quickly write bunch of code.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.930
Now there's tons of things about Emmett.

02:22.990 --> 02:26.100
And again I wouldn't want to spend a lot of time on that.

02:26.500 --> 02:32.930
However in our most basic example what's gonna happen is that every time I would like to create a page

02:32.930 --> 02:36.760
the email element I don't have to start by the angle bracket.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.830
I can just say whatever element I would like to render.

02:39.970 --> 02:45.340
So let's say I'm looking again for heading one note is the moment I'm just gonna type each one and the

02:45.340 --> 02:46.780
same is gonna be for you.

02:46.840 --> 02:51.590
We're gonna have a suggestion and as you can see it says clearly Emmett abbreviation.

02:51.640 --> 02:56.430
So what happens is if let's say I would like to have having one writing to or heading six.

02:56.500 --> 03:01.490
I can just type and Mike H and then we can choose whatever heading we would like.

03:01.630 --> 03:07.300
The same would work if I want a paragraph again I just need to type whatever name of the element or

03:07.300 --> 03:13.390
let's say not the name of the element but starting letter of the arm and Emmett is gonna do the rest.

03:13.390 --> 03:20.240
Now if I would like to render that element I would have to press tab or return and basically the entropy.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.660
So once you press it notice right now I have my own.

03:23.500 --> 03:28.870
Now again this is just the most basic thing that we can do with them and later on throughout the course

03:29.230 --> 03:34.290
obviously we're going to expand our knowledge regarding M and not just on a very basic level.

03:34.420 --> 03:40.780
This is going to save us from again typing and typing and typing unnecessary email where we can just

03:40.780 --> 03:45.500
look or whatever element we would like and right away it's going to be random.

03:45.820 --> 03:53.750
So let's say here I'm gonna say this is an eight paragraph meaning paragraph like with just to be noticed

03:53.800 --> 03:55.120
if I'm going to say this.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.940
Sure enough I'm gonna have an hour sleep I didn't save it first.

03:58.960 --> 04:04.810
So now once I save it notice I'll have this is M paragraph so all this is very cool again if you like

04:04.810 --> 04:11.030
to find out more information you can just head over to this and I go and if you're using different text

04:11.070 --> 04:14.710
or you should be able to install it as an extension.

04:14.860 --> 04:19.100
However with Visual Studio code it comes in pre-built.

04:19.180 --> 04:24.490
Now last but not least all this work that we did we could have done it actually with an element.

04:24.580 --> 04:25.900
So let me delete this.

04:26.030 --> 04:28.000
And once you're gonna have an exclamation mark.

04:28.350 --> 04:33.410
So I'm gonna press shift an exclamation mark and I this again this is gonna give me Emmet and privation

04:33.740 --> 04:34.990
and the moment we press center.

04:34.990 --> 04:36.340
Notice what happens.

04:36.400 --> 04:41.890
So now we're getting the preparation email structure that we worked on in the last video.

04:41.890 --> 04:47.290
So this pretty much saves this time where we don't have to retype this and again please don't focus

04:47.290 --> 04:52.620
on these mad attacks we we're gonna talk about them once we already have sufficient knowledge of the

04:52.630 --> 04:53.190
email.

04:53.360 --> 04:58.510
There is no point right now to fill your head with this information as well as this language.

04:58.510 --> 05:04.960
Again what we need to focus right now is the fact of the title that's sitting within the head element

05:05.380 --> 05:08.570
as well as all the work that we're going to do in the body element.

05:08.980 --> 05:13.690
So let me close maybe this summit for now as you can see right now this is still saying Hello my name

05:13.690 --> 05:22.210
is John but once we're going to save this I don't know proper structure let's call there's this one

05:22.990 --> 05:30.420
structure structure as you can see my typing is just awesome and we're all gonna have just a simple

05:30.420 --> 05:34.290
hiding one with the title of the page being a document.
