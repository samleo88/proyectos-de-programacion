00:00.300 --> 00:00.920
Interesting.

00:00.960 --> 00:04.050
But what if I don't want this repetition.

00:04.080 --> 00:08.350
What if everything that I'm seeing with background repeat I don't like it.

00:08.530 --> 00:14.610
So I would want some kind of property that would fix the fact that repetition is happening now again

00:14.610 --> 00:16.260
in order to make this ah you know what.

00:16.260 --> 00:18.370
I think this is gonna be fine for now.

00:18.540 --> 00:21.790
I can just leave them doesn't cover too much of my space.

00:21.900 --> 00:24.730
I'm going to have to add only two properties anyway.

00:24.960 --> 00:30.590
But what's happening is we can use the background size property for us now for the background size we're

00:30.590 --> 00:36.360
going to look at the few options few values on the floor first one the most important one is going to

00:36.360 --> 00:41.480
be background size and then we're looking for the value of cover.

00:41.550 --> 00:50.190
Now what cover is gonna do is regardless of the size of the day of the background image is always gonna

00:50.210 --> 00:51.990
feel up to Dave.

00:52.110 --> 00:56.350
Now it's also gonna do the same thing even though the image is really small.

00:56.430 --> 00:58.290
Now you know what actually we're going to delete it.

00:58.290 --> 00:59.880
My apologies.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.450
Let's do it like this.

01:01.500 --> 01:06.250
Let's say background and just to prove my point size is gonna be cover.

01:06.300 --> 01:12.780
Now what's gonna happen is like I said I believe in the first video that the actual quality of the image

01:12.900 --> 01:15.230
is gonna suffer dramatically.

01:15.270 --> 01:15.870
See this.

01:15.930 --> 01:22.050
We have the first image nicely covers everything as well as the second image nicely covers everything.

01:22.050 --> 01:26.220
Now I'm not going to make this one smaller bigger we might as well go to the bigger browser window and

01:26.220 --> 01:27.830
you'll see the same thing.

01:27.870 --> 01:33.210
Now we have the first one that the image is cleanly covers everything and then the second one which

01:33.210 --> 01:36.620
is really distorted because we have picked this small image.

01:36.690 --> 01:38.560
Now the property did its job.

01:38.730 --> 01:40.290
It did cover everything.

01:40.290 --> 01:45.390
However this is where you need to be careful we're not speaking to the image of the small.

01:45.390 --> 01:47.820
Now we also have an option of contained.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.440
So here let's write.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.390
Background.

01:51.390 --> 01:52.310
Background.

01:52.320 --> 01:56.750
Again we had size Magnum size.

01:56.850 --> 02:03.390
Let's say that this is going to be cover now with the arms or not cover contain with the contain.

02:03.420 --> 02:04.790
There is gonna be an image.

02:04.810 --> 02:06.930
However if there is not enough space.

02:06.930 --> 02:09.090
So this is gonna keep the ratio of the image.

02:09.270 --> 02:12.420
But if there is not enough space again there's gonna be repetition.

02:12.440 --> 02:13.350
Don't believe me.

02:13.420 --> 02:14.040
That's right.

02:14.040 --> 02:19.730
Background back on ground background repeat.

02:19.760 --> 02:25.860
And let's go with no repeat and you'll see that only one image is able to fit there.

02:26.060 --> 02:31.430
While we are still keeping our here this ratio so that's gonna be the difference between two of them.

02:31.430 --> 02:37.940
And again in my most cases especially in the beginning I believe you're gonna be using this cover in

02:37.940 --> 02:43.940
order to nice make nice headers or banners or some kind of parallax effect you're just gonna pick a

02:43.940 --> 02:47.970
nice image you're going to set the background size to the cover.

02:48.020 --> 02:51.290
So this is always gonna cover and then you're gonna be good to go.
