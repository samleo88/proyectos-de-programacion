00:00.140 --> 00:06.060
That before we can work with our media queerish first thing that we actually would need to do is we

00:06.060 --> 00:12.640
would need to fix this title over here because you can see or hear that we have a just blunt text.

00:12.690 --> 00:13.220
Right.

00:13.290 --> 00:18.060
And since we're going to be reusing this title right it wouldn't be Berrow if we would actually style

00:18.060 --> 00:18.550
it.

00:18.630 --> 00:24.260
So we're going to go back over here and we're going to say this is going to be tied up like this.

00:24.390 --> 00:29.040
And then going to start very simple we're going to say class title and the class title is going to have

00:29.040 --> 00:35.340
a margin this is going to be 10 pixels then it's going to be zero and it's going to be fully pixels

00:35.760 --> 00:37.810
and then it's going to be another zero.

00:38.010 --> 00:44.470
So basically what I'm saying is that 10 pixels here 40 pixels here and left and right here.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.730
Then after that we can have a cursor.

00:46.750 --> 00:49.590
I'm going to say pointer you know like this.

00:49.620 --> 00:54.520
Then after that we're going to have a title text here.

00:54.750 --> 01:00.220
And what we're going to say is this is going to be font size we're 60 pixels.

01:00.240 --> 01:01.250
All right.

01:01.260 --> 01:03.490
So you can see that I'm targeting this text.

01:03.730 --> 01:11.040
Then I have a text transform and this is going to be capitalized again and then after that we're going

01:11.040 --> 01:18.050
to have a color hash tag you this 5 7 5 7 5 7 like this.

01:18.060 --> 01:18.450
Right.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.040
So this is going to be a great text.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.160
We're going to we're going to have a title underway.

01:23.550 --> 01:30.650
So we're going to say title line here and then we have a with first of all.

01:30.740 --> 01:36.420
So here we're going to play with and with this is going to be 50 pixels or here right.

01:36.420 --> 01:38.470
So again this is going to be for the on the line.

01:38.730 --> 01:42.450
And if you remember this is going to be exactly like this one right now.

01:42.450 --> 01:45.510
The values are not going to be the same but the process is this.

01:46.090 --> 01:49.790
So we're going to have a border through pixels.

01:50.070 --> 02:00.490
So I would hear them say hash tag to be more here than this is going to be 9 8 and 0 like this.

02:00.510 --> 02:03.070
And then after that we're going to have another transition.

02:03.300 --> 02:10.680
So I'm going to say trends not transform transition and this is going to be with it's going to be transforming

02:10.740 --> 02:13.190
with four seconds.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.350
He's again right.

02:15.360 --> 02:19.280
He is going to have a border.

02:19.550 --> 02:21.340
This is going to be four seconds.

02:21.370 --> 02:23.560
He's here.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.380
And then we're going to have a hovering effect.

02:26.370 --> 02:26.810
Right.

02:26.970 --> 02:33.330
So basically now we have a transition between this transition should happen and what I want this transition

02:33.330 --> 02:36.280
is as I'm hovering over the whole thing right now.

02:36.280 --> 02:39.300
All this on the line but the whole title.

02:39.390 --> 02:44.780
So I'm going to say here that this is going to be Tyrel cover.

02:44.890 --> 02:49.300
So old the whole class and that I'm going to say title underlined.

02:49.650 --> 02:56.490
So basically what I'm saying is as I'm hovering over the whole title on the line on the line or here

02:56.850 --> 03:02.820
something should happen and that something is going to be with and the with is going to be 200 pixels

03:03.410 --> 03:10.130
like this and the border is going to be three pixels solid red or here like this.

03:10.320 --> 03:16.410
So let's say this here and let's actually check it out and you can see what's happened right as I'm

03:16.410 --> 03:18.200
hovering over the whole thing.

03:18.240 --> 03:23.880
It actually expands and changes the color as I move away my mouse.

03:23.900 --> 03:30.210
Here you can see it goes back arm right and now that we actually styled a title.

03:30.210 --> 03:34.140
Now we can go ahead and style the actual

03:41.700 --> 03:45.470
responsiveness of or hear these phantasm.

03:45.510 --> 03:47.240
So as we go to the bigger screen.

03:47.280 --> 03:47.980
Right.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.100
Something should change.

03:49.100 --> 03:51.060
And what I want to do with this title.

03:51.070 --> 03:56.170
I actually want to grab this one right and actually place a cut here.

03:56.220 --> 04:01.800
And let's just go somewhere before the skills actually let's place it over here in front of them right.

04:01.830 --> 04:07.020
So we're going to say this one we're going to do is we're just going to create more room here and we're

04:07.020 --> 04:09.380
going to start working with our media queries.
