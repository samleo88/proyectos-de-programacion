1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,370
Hey guys, welcome back. So we learned how

2

00:00:02,370  -->  00:00:05,730
to create some qml elements and we haven't

3

00:00:05,730  -->  00:00:07,620
even touched on it yet. So I'm actually

4

00:00:07,620  -->  00:00:10,889
going to go back one page here and the

5

00:00:10,889  -->  00:00:13,530
controls all of these elements become

6

00:00:13,530  -->  00:00:17,580
available when we import QtQuick

7

00:00:17,580  -->  00:00:19,949
controls right here, and so we're going to be

8

00:00:19,949  -->  00:00:21,990
using some of them in this application.

9

00:00:21,990  -->  00:00:24,990
So what we're going to do is first off

10

00:00:24,990  -->  00:00:30,720
we're going to create a button with the id:

11

00:00:30,720  -->  00:00:35,910
mainbutton, and let me just click in

12

00:00:35,910  -->  00:00:37,590
here so you guys can see an example too.

13

00:00:37,590  -->  00:00:40,260
Basically, all it takes right now is

14

00:00:40,260  -->  00:00:43,260
going to be a text property. So as you

15

00:00:43,260  -->  00:00:44,730
can see here that's going to create a

16

00:00:44,730  -->  00:00:45,660
button.

17

00:00:45,660  -->  00:00:49,770
Let's jump in here and add text to say

18

00:00:49,770  -->  00:00:53,550
"Push Me" going to save this and run the

19

00:00:53,550  -->  00:00:59,129
application, and you're going to see this.

20

00:00:59,129  -->  00:01:04,049
This is a very pretty application so far.

21

00:01:04,049  -->  00:01:06,210
We've got a button overlaying text so we

22

00:01:06,210  -->  00:01:09,210
can't see what the text says. So how we're

23

00:01:09,210  -->  00:01:13,710
going to fix that in qml basically

24

00:01:13,710  -->  00:01:15,659
everything needs to be positioned to

25

00:01:15,659  -->  00:01:18,990
some degree. Now you can import a layout, it's

26

00:01:18,990  -->  00:01:21,450
QtQuick layouts, and we're going to be

27

00:01:21,450  -->  00:01:23,610
talking about layouts later. For right now

28

00:01:23,610  -->  00:01:26,490
we're going to be adding an id: to text

29

00:01:26,490  -->  00:01:31,320
and we're going to call it mainText, and so in

30

00:01:31,320  -->  00:01:35,310
in the text here we can we can define

31

00:01:35,310  -->  00:01:37,860
some anchors, you can go anchors.top: and

32

00:01:37,860  -->  00:01:41,040
you can set the

33

00:01:41,040  -->  00:01:43,380
position based on the top in pixels from

34

00:01:43,380  -->  00:01:44,549
the top.

35

00:01:44,549  -->  00:01:46,110
That sounds a little complicated so what

36

00:01:46,110  -->  00:01:47,430
I'm going to do is I'm going to set this

37

00:01:47,430  -->  00:01:49,409
top equal to this bottom and what should

38

00:01:49,409  -->  00:01:51,299
happen is our button will show up

39

00:01:51,299  -->  00:01:57,570
underneath the text. So anchors.top:

40

00:01:57,570  -->  00:02:01,469
mainText.bottom and this seems

41

00:02:01,469  -->  00:02:05,070
pretty simple. Going to refresh the

42

00:02:05,070  -->  00:02:06,430
application, and

43

00:02:06,430  -->  00:02:08,950
as you can see it's actually worked and

44

00:02:08,950  -->  00:02:11,230
this is because we've set the height of

45

00:02:11,230  -->  00:02:15,250
the main text to 50, so this is 50

46

00:02:15,250  -->  00:02:18,100
pixels right here. Now we can also center

47

00:02:18,100  -->  00:02:19,720
content and we're going to talk about

48

00:02:19,720  -->  00:02:22,630
that a little bit as well.

49

00:02:22,630  -->  00:02:25,660
You can basically center items

50

00:02:25,660  -->  00:02:27,880
horizontally or vertically and we're

51

00:02:27,880  -->  00:02:30,580
going to talk about that right now. Right

52

00:02:30,580  -->  00:02:33,910
here we're going to set horizontal

53

00:02:33,910  -->  00:02:39,790
alignment, so horizontalAlignment: is

54

00:02:39,790  -->  00:02:43,390
going to be equal to TextAlignHCenter

55

00:02:43,400  -->  00:02:48,900
and this means horizontally centered.

56

00:02:49,030  -->  00:02:53,860
We're going to save it, refresh, and

57

00:02:53,860  -->  00:02:56,560
something went terribly wrong here.

58

00:02:56,560  -->  00:03:04,720
This is 300 pixels wide. So let's set the width,

59

00:03:04,720  -->  00:03:09,220
it's actually maybe not getting that

60

00:03:09,220  -->  00:03:11,470
property in there. Let's start this again.

61

00:03:11,470  -->  00:03:15,970
There we go. So when we created the

62

00:03:15,970  -->  00:03:18,280
rectangle it was actually technically 0

63

00:03:18,280  -->  00:03:20,470
pixels wide. That's also why it wasn't red, I

64

00:03:20,470  -->  00:03:22,060
didn't even notice that it wasn't red there.

65

00:03:22,060  -->  00:03:28,510
And then this we're going to set anchors

66

00:03:28,510  -->  00:03:33,459
and you can open it up like this too. So

67

00:03:33,459  -->  00:03:42,040
we can say top: it's going to be 20,

68

00:03:42,040  -->  00:03:46,150
and that's it for now. You could create a

69

00:03:46,150  -->  00:03:48,459
list of all of the different anchor

70

00:03:48,459  -->  00:03:58,420
points.

71

00:03:58,420  -->  00:04:04,000
Alright, I will have to check into

72

00:04:04,000  -->  00:04:06,250
that. That worked maybe in an older version,

73

00:04:06,250  -->  00:04:09,040
maybe I did it correctly. Unsupported

74

00:04:09,040  -->  00:04:17,290
type "QQuickAnchorLine" does text not

75

00:04:17,290  -->  00:04:18,730
have access to that? I don't think it

76

00:04:18,730  -->  00:04:19,389
does.

77

00:04:19,389  -->  00:04:22,780
You can also set padding though but for

78

00:04:22,780  -->  00:04:24,010
right now we're just going to run this

79

00:04:24,010  -->  00:04:26,080
application, we're going to center the

80

00:04:26,080  -->  00:04:34,120
button as well. So you can see a list of

81

00:04:34,120  -->  00:04:37,479
all of the members for the button

82

00:04:37,479  -->  00:04:42,010
including what it will inherit from others. So,

83

00:04:42,010  -->  00:04:46,750
clicked is a method here, we can use

84

00:04:46,750  -->  00:04:51,250
anchors.bottom, bottomMargin, etc,

85

00:04:51,250  -->  00:04:57,490
alignWhenCentered, horizontalCenter, etc. So,

86

00:04:57,490  -->  00:05:19,409
what we're going to do at this point,

87

00:05:19,409  -->  00:05:22,709
we're gonna make it do something...so

88

00:05:22,709  -->  00:05:23,729
what we're going to do at this point is

89

00:05:23,729  -->  00:05:25,019
we're going to make it do something when

90

00:05:25,019  -->  00:05:27,749
we click it. So I'm going to quit the application

91

00:05:27,749  -->  00:05:31,499
there, and then what we're going to do is

92

00:05:31,499  -->  00:05:35,519
on clicked, I'm going to to open up some JavaScript here,

93

00:05:35,519  -->  00:05:39,779
and we're going to set the main page

94

00:05:39,779  -->  00:05:42,419
here so let me give the rectangle an id:

95

00:05:42,419  -->  00:05:49,889
of myrectangle, and we're going to set

96

00:05:49,889  -->  00:06:03,959
myrectangle.color = "#000" As

97

00:06:03,959  -->  00:06:06,929
you can see it does that. Now what we can do

98

00:06:06,929  -->  00:06:10,860
is we can say if my color is black, so

99

00:06:10,860  -->  00:06:21,479
if(myrectangle.color == "#000")

100

00:06:21,479  -->  00:06:27,779
we're going to actually turn it red.

101

00:06:27,779  -->  00:06:37,199
Wow, my keyboard sucks today...else we're going to

102

00:06:37,199  -->  00:06:41,580
turn it black.

103

00:06:41,580  -->  00:06:47,099
Let's go ahead and save this, rerun the

104

00:06:47,099  -->  00:06:48,810
application, we should now have a button

105

00:06:48,810  -->  00:06:53,430
that works as a toggle...it doesn't. So

106

00:06:53,430  -->  00:06:59,400
let's print out the console.log

107

00:06:59,400  -->  00:07:03,090
(myrectangle.color) Let's see what color

108

00:07:03,090  -->  00:07:06,090
were getting back from qml here.

109

00:07:06,090  -->  00:07:12,000
Alright, so it actually takes you from

110

00:07:12,000  -->  00:07:17,969
the shorthand into the standard right

111

00:07:17,969  -->  00:07:18,569
there.

112

00:07:18,569  -->  00:07:25,080
So if we push it and push it...

113

00:07:25,080  -->  00:07:27,060
I'm setting colors not color.

114

00:07:27,060  -->  00:07:30,090
Wow, okay, there we go.

115

00:07:30,090  -->  00:07:33,210
Let's refresh and this should now work as a toggle

116

00:07:33,210  -->  00:07:37,469
button, and it does. You can also set the

117

00:07:37,469  -->  00:07:39,210
the color of the text as well if you

118

00:07:39,210  -->  00:07:51,460
just add color going to set this to gray.

119

00:07:51,460  -->  00:08:05,569
I need to put that in quotations. Alright,

120

00:08:05,569  -->  00:08:10,610
start and there we go. Now you can see it no

121

00:08:10,610  -->  00:08:14,089
matter what. We could also change how

122

00:08:14,089  -->  00:08:16,909
that looks as well based on the

123

00:08:16,909  -->  00:08:18,919
button click we could turn it white or black.

124

00:08:18,919  -->  00:08:20,869
So we're not going to do that right now,

125

00:08:20,869  -->  00:08:22,729
but you guys to see a bit of event

126

00:08:22,729  -->  00:08:25,129
handling here embedded into each element

127

00:08:25,129  -->  00:08:28,699
that you create, and also why the ids

128

00:08:28,699  -->  00:08:30,319
come in handy, and how you can change

129

00:08:30,319  -->  00:08:37,599
properties on the fly.
