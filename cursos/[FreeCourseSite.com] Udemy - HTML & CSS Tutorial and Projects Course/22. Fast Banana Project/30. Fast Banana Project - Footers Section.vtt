WEBVTT

00:00.160 --> 00:04.290
And the last section is going to be working on is going to be out here just for our section.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.870
So let's go back to next issue here.

00:06.870 --> 00:08.380
Now we can close the script.

00:08.390 --> 00:10.250
We're not going to be using this one anymore.

00:10.680 --> 00:18.000
And if we're going end of quote here now we would want a footer section and so we're going to have a

00:18.000 --> 00:19.050
footer.

00:19.050 --> 00:24.130
Select the line copy paste the line and you can see I didn't do it.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.030
So I'm going to say end of four.

00:27.390 --> 00:35.300
Then after that what you want is a form for a whole element for no real going to see any footer.

00:35.320 --> 00:42.860
All right press tab now we have idea for and over here what we would want is actual section.

00:42.860 --> 00:43.310
Right.

00:43.560 --> 00:48.840
And are you going to say that this is going to be for the info section and then we're going to have

00:48.870 --> 00:50.750
a footer maps section right.

00:50.820 --> 00:53.780
So we're going to have a main one as a.

00:54.190 --> 01:04.800
And over here we're going to have a section section or here and this can be hash tag for info info here.

01:05.010 --> 01:08.260
And then we're going to press tab and then the next one.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.470
Copy and paste.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.310
Second line is going to be for a map right here.

01:12.330 --> 01:18.180
We're going to place our I-frame with a Google Maps and all we're here with we're going to do is we're

01:18.180 --> 01:20.540
going to have a fall.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.370
I don't.

01:21.620 --> 01:21.820
Right.

01:21.830 --> 01:24.840
So first we're going to have in-focus center.

01:24.990 --> 01:30.670
So Dave with the class of info center center or here.

01:30.840 --> 01:34.750
And then this is going to be a parent element for all of them.

01:35.060 --> 01:39.260
No we're here we're going to have a div of info.

01:39.270 --> 01:48.940
I have them in full and I'm right and within the info item we're going to have a font or some just is

01:48.940 --> 01:57.630
going to be a I f a f hey check here press tab and then we're going to have a paragraph.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.510
So we're all going to have a paragraph and not say we're going to have like 10 words.

02:01.510 --> 02:02.090
All right.

02:02.140 --> 02:08.950
So Lorem turn right and you can see that it didn't work out nicely because what we would want actually

02:09.050 --> 02:09.970
written like this.

02:09.980 --> 02:13.720
Right so we're going to place this in the curly brackets.

02:13.720 --> 02:17.870
Press time now we would want a more a more here.

02:17.890 --> 02:18.740
Right.

02:18.860 --> 02:21.800
And basically you would need three of them.

02:22.030 --> 02:22.560
Right.

02:22.570 --> 02:23.590
So three more.

02:23.830 --> 02:27.060
So we're going to see where this one ends select.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.090
Or here again this Dave.

02:30.230 --> 02:30.490
Right.

02:30.490 --> 02:36.250
So now we can see that I went one too far on here and one two three.

02:36.250 --> 02:39.320
All right so now we have four total.

02:39.330 --> 02:41.700
No you would want a map.

02:41.700 --> 02:46.780
All right so the I-frame map over here and the way we're going to do this.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.600
Want to go back over here and we're going to say this is going to be Google Maps.

02:54.220 --> 02:59.640
Then we're going to go to Google Maps or we're going to say New York.

02:59.660 --> 02:59.920
All right.

02:59.920 --> 03:08.200
So we're going to say New York then other ones we have in New York are going to share the same bed map

03:09.080 --> 03:09.550
here.

03:09.580 --> 03:14.050
Copy and paste this can cause this one out and on here.

03:14.050 --> 03:16.160
Copy and paste this here.

03:16.220 --> 03:17.350
The with right away.

03:17.350 --> 03:26.220
Let's set it two hundred pixels so it is 100 percent the height and say do what 350.

03:26.460 --> 03:26.740
All right.

03:26.740 --> 03:34.780
We don't need to over exaggerate so then we can say this and then we're going to go to see SS and we

03:34.780 --> 03:40.370
just need to Styler it so Mame's U.S.S.R. here and all the way in the bottom.

03:40.390 --> 03:42.200
This is going to be our footer.

03:42.400 --> 03:55.010
So we're here doing this hashtags footer snag here and let's do our work and we're here to first things

03:55.010 --> 03:55.400
first.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.470
We're going to have a footer.

03:57.660 --> 04:08.910
So the whole footer say hash tag footer and railgun say padding 40 pixels or the pixels 0 here then

04:08.940 --> 04:12.500
we're going to have a min height of let's say 60 view right.

04:14.040 --> 04:21.540
This right then we have a background Macron that's going to be hash tags 0 0 8.

04:21.810 --> 04:24.710
And then we'll have a seven each one.

04:24.710 --> 04:25.040
All right.

04:25.050 --> 04:25.810
Think this right.

04:25.840 --> 04:30.980
So this is going to be the background then for both of the classes right.

04:31.230 --> 04:39.270
So I'm going to say in full center and that's the one that's parent element all three of them here.

04:39.470 --> 04:42.340
And also to a I-frame.

04:42.560 --> 04:52.340
So I'm going to say I am realizing this we would want with to be 90 percent 90 percent over here and

04:52.660 --> 04:58.710
margin 40 pixels top bottom and auto.

04:58.880 --> 05:06.670
Once we have that the next thing that I would want to work is with an eye frame frame here and I'm going

05:06.670 --> 05:14.620
to say the display block I realized this right now I can see the display as Mark and border a radius

05:14.620 --> 05:15.690
20 pixels right.

05:15.730 --> 05:21.950
So around the edges or here then we would want a class of info item.

05:21.960 --> 05:28.160
All right so now we're talking about the parent that holds the font or someone on here and this text.

05:28.270 --> 05:36.910
So I'm going to say or here we would want a full and I'm this.

05:37.180 --> 05:40.160
And here you would want to say display.

05:40.190 --> 05:47.740
I don't want to say flex this margin 10 pixels and zero at all here.

05:47.740 --> 05:51.390
So basically what we're getting is these 10 pixels in between.

05:51.910 --> 05:53.950
And then we would want to work with actual font.

05:54.060 --> 06:05.710
So we're going to say in full I I'm a 4 here and I'm going to say font size 30 pixels like this color.

06:06.120 --> 06:18.000
When I told them to say hash tag FFC 9 1 for this then we'll have a pairing of 10 pixels here and background

06:18.090 --> 06:22.330
is going to be hashtag 1 9 1 9 1 9.

06:22.770 --> 06:23.030
All right.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.790
So this is I was going to look like we're going to do a little margin right.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.420
So we're going to send margin right.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.720
And we're going to save 15 pixels on this.

06:34.080 --> 06:40.250
Then when we're done with this now we would want a responsive screen.

06:40.380 --> 06:47.970
And so once the screen changes we will want to make for a response of how do we do that media screen

06:49.150 --> 06:50.180
here.

06:50.380 --> 07:00.480
And and right now we're men with here and they're all going to say that this is going to be a 7 7 6

07:00.480 --> 07:03.090
pixels like this.

07:03.150 --> 07:12.300
Then after that we would want a hash tag for or here who would want first to display flex.

07:12.340 --> 07:15.920
So once it's going to be a bigger screen this is going to be a display of flux.

07:15.940 --> 07:16.960
So let's check it out.

07:16.970 --> 07:26.190
It looks like fresh right now I can see that our map is on here and this is going to be on display for.

07:26.890 --> 07:32.430
Then the next thing that we would want over here is fuller and phone for that price.

07:32.440 --> 07:37.810
So we're going to say we're here for info karma.

07:38.050 --> 07:41.700
Time for our map here.

07:41.770 --> 07:47.030
I want to say flex 0 0 50 percent.

07:47.170 --> 07:51.500
So both of them spanning 50 percent or less.

07:51.570 --> 07:54.530
Now you can see this is how they're going to look like.

07:54.530 --> 07:59.750
Now what I would want over is for info we would want this to place obviously in the center.

08:00.190 --> 08:10.160
So we're going to go back over here and we're going to say for info on here I'm going to say play flex

08:10.670 --> 08:11.950
first right.

08:11.970 --> 08:21.420
And then we'll have a line item center because you can see or hear right for the info center right.

08:21.890 --> 08:27.950
You can see or hear foot or info is apparent for info center our interest in that is just holds all

08:27.950 --> 08:31.220
three of them right but by its own it's actually a single item.

08:31.430 --> 08:34.200
All right so once we're styling This is a flex.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.110
We're only working with all of them as one.

08:37.130 --> 08:39.070
Right because we have this info center.

08:39.550 --> 08:45.950
So here you can see we have the supply flex and the next thing that I would want to do is actually have

08:46.020 --> 08:50.620
aligned items center like this.

08:50.630 --> 08:56.810
All right so we have a line on center go back and I can see that actually side by side.

08:57.090 --> 08:59.800
And now let's go back to the top.

08:59.990 --> 09:03.540
Let's actually look what we have right.

09:03.770 --> 09:06.630
So first we had a nav bar.

09:06.740 --> 09:12.770
Then we had a banner over here with the buttons were as we scrolling you can see that this is actually

09:12.770 --> 09:16.140
going to be a fixed position.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.300
All right so you can see it doesn't matter where I go.

09:18.300 --> 09:18.940
All right.

09:18.950 --> 09:21.230
This is going to be still following me around.

09:21.260 --> 09:28.370
We can still click it over here and this is still a smooth scrolling right so ASM scrolling you can

09:28.370 --> 09:30.520
see that I'm on up and down.

09:30.520 --> 09:31.040
All right.

09:31.190 --> 09:35.740
Then after that we have this little section on here with the phone Possum's.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.010
Then we have the skills section.

09:38.150 --> 09:44.420
Then after that we had a subscribe section and honestly everything is responsive right because we're

09:44.420 --> 09:46.850
using flex and grid for this.

09:46.930 --> 09:55.340
And after that we had a war here this filtering section right where we have the actual Jake wari plug

09:55.340 --> 09:57.230
in that we were using.

09:57.280 --> 09:57.900
Right.

09:58.070 --> 10:04.660
Basically we can filter the images I suppose and then over here this was a accordion.

10:04.760 --> 10:13.460
Then over here we had a current project where we are actually using a magnifica pop up like this.

10:13.460 --> 10:18.540
Then after that we had a numbers count section.

10:18.550 --> 10:26.050
Some basically where we have a number that are counting and we have a meet our team section like this

10:26.530 --> 10:29.130
and this is going to be the progress bar section.

10:29.490 --> 10:37.190
Then over here this is going to be amazing prices section here and then we have the our carousel here

10:37.220 --> 10:39.780
which is a responsive carousel.

10:39.830 --> 10:41.240
Marion this is going to be our last.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.390
This is going to be an intersection.

10:43.460 --> 10:45.380
This is going to be it for this project.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.320
And I hope to see you on my next project.
