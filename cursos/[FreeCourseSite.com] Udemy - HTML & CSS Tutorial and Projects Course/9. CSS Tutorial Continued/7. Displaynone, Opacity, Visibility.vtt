00:00.480 --> 00:06.910
Well we're still on the topic of display property eventually inevitably as you're working with CSX.

00:06.960 --> 00:13.830
You're gonna come across the opacity property as well as visibility and you're gonna see the value for

00:13.860 --> 00:15.870
display property set or not.

00:15.900 --> 00:20.760
So why don't we cover all these properties with these values just so we can see the difference.

00:21.030 --> 00:26.570
Now within the annexation AML we will going to create three new divs and we're going to say there's

00:26.580 --> 00:30.030
going to be div on the first one is going to have a class of none.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.870
So we're going to look at the class of none and let's.

00:32.910 --> 00:33.690
I don't know.

00:33.690 --> 00:34.080
Right.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.300
Also might be the name here and let's copy and paste it.

00:37.340 --> 00:41.890
Now once we copy and paste that I would like to select both of them and let's write here.

00:42.150 --> 00:46.990
Sorry here is gonna be equal to one so that's gonna be my class name as well as the value.

00:47.250 --> 00:50.940
And as always you'll see why we're doing that just in a second.

00:51.000 --> 00:51.720
And let's.

00:51.720 --> 00:58.260
Right over here opacity is gonna be I don't know five and this is gonna be basically opacity of zero

00:58.260 --> 01:02.760
point five and then the last one is gonna be opacity with zero.

01:02.760 --> 01:06.220
So let me like this and now this is gonna be my opacity with you.

01:06.780 --> 01:09.590
I also would like to have the div and you know what.

01:09.600 --> 01:14.850
Might as well copy and paste it and let's set this up with a hidden so you know what.

01:14.860 --> 01:17.900
No not give this a class of visibility.

01:18.300 --> 01:22.440
So the name is also gonna be visibility but the value is going to be here.

01:22.920 --> 01:26.740
So visibility hopefully I'm typing this correctly.

01:26.760 --> 01:30.400
Now let me say what this is gonna be my device now for each and every div.

01:30.420 --> 01:37.640
But again add as always some general styles let's say there is gonna have some background background

01:37.640 --> 01:42.760
there's going gonna be below there is gonna be a little of of margin all around so I'm going to say

01:42.790 --> 01:48.090
I don't know a little bit of margin of like let's say 10 pixels and read off the margin why don't we

01:48.090 --> 01:50.170
add some coloring as well.

01:50.410 --> 01:52.450
Let's write that color is gonna be white.

01:53.050 --> 01:55.530
So what's happening right now with these properties.

01:55.570 --> 01:58.250
Now we have the classes so I can say none.

01:58.360 --> 02:01.310
And here I would like to start using by display.

02:01.420 --> 02:04.830
Now this is not going to be display block the inline block or in line.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.640
Instead we're going to set this up within.

02:07.090 --> 02:13.210
And now let me first add all of them with opacity ease and with visibilities and then I'm gonna go over

02:13.210 --> 02:17.010
to the actual developer tools and then we'll see kind of the differences.

02:17.050 --> 02:23.020
So for now what we're saying is that we're the class of none and display of none we cannot see the element

02:23.180 --> 02:24.400
and that is true.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.930
Now what other options we're going to have.

02:25.950 --> 02:34.060
Well we had I believe opacity This is gonna be equal to a actual opacity property and opacity properties

02:34.090 --> 02:38.370
gonna do something very similar where this is gonna control the visibility.

02:38.370 --> 02:43.320
Now the max value is gonna be one which is gonna be by default right away displayed.

02:43.540 --> 02:49.390
And then we have an option of zero which is gonna make sure that the actual class does not display meaning

02:49.390 --> 02:55.120
the element or whatever but where since we're using the class to selected the one that has the zero

02:55.380 --> 02:56.690
it is not going to be displayed.

02:57.070 --> 02:59.990
Now in this case obviously I need to select the proper one.

03:00.040 --> 03:07.300
So if my class was zero notice I'm having a right away the div however we cannot see it because this

03:07.300 --> 03:11.340
is where again we're working with these values where opacity is changing.

03:11.340 --> 03:16.510
Now if you remember it was something very similar as we're working with the colors where we're using

03:16.510 --> 03:18.730
the RGA value.

03:18.730 --> 03:25.120
Remember we had color and then the last value in our GPA was the transparency or the capacity.

03:25.150 --> 03:31.020
So the same thing is working here just with the whole div where by default all the capacities are going

03:31.020 --> 03:31.920
to be one.

03:31.960 --> 03:35.470
And that's why we don't need to write it and we can see it clearly like this.

03:35.500 --> 03:41.150
However if we change it to zero which would be the minimum value then we cannot see the deal anymore.

03:41.260 --> 03:45.710
And also I'm going to have the value of five which is gonna be zero five.

03:46.090 --> 03:50.050
Now I'm not going to cover each and every value between 0 and 1.

03:50.170 --> 03:56.110
Just understand that we are just using right now around values because they just make a little bit more

03:56.110 --> 03:56.760
sense.

03:56.860 --> 04:02.800
But if I'm gonna say zero point five the opacity the transparency of this div is gonna be like this.

04:02.830 --> 04:09.100
So it's gonna be somewhere between the middle of totally hidden element as well as totally clear elements

04:09.160 --> 04:11.240
because we're going to have the transparency of far.

04:11.500 --> 04:18.160
Now if I'm gonna change this to zero point seventy four then my APS opacity goes bigger because it goes

04:18.160 --> 04:23.590
towards one meaning I am less transparent if I'm gonna go with zero point twenty five.

04:23.980 --> 04:29.370
Then the element is gonna be way more transparent because we're closer to 1.

04:29.440 --> 04:35.070
So you're bouncing in between these two values 0 and 1 and whatever value you're picking in our case

04:35.100 --> 04:38.830
zero point five then the transparency is gonna be like this.

04:38.890 --> 04:46.210
Now last but not least we have here also the visibility and for this we had the class is the ability

04:46.600 --> 04:49.350
and we're gonna go with visibility properly.

04:49.380 --> 04:55.180
And notice what's happens with visibility we have an option of hearing or I can head over here.

04:55.180 --> 05:00.820
And again we can have these hidden more visible now visible again is gonna be by default because all

05:00.820 --> 05:04.010
the elements are going to be shown by default.

05:04.120 --> 05:09.940
But if you would want to have hidden then we're gonna have them now maybe in order to kind of see what's

05:09.940 --> 05:10.890
happening.

05:10.960 --> 05:15.640
Like I said it's gonna be better if we're gonna go to developer tools just to see how everything is

05:15.640 --> 05:18.940
working now which we're gonna head over here to inspect.

05:19.120 --> 05:24.460
We see that there is gonna be my elements and maybe I can make this a little bit bigger then within

05:24.460 --> 05:25.780
the body notice what's going to happen.

05:26.320 --> 05:33.790
So we're gonna have my own display of not then I have my own positive one as well as here we're working

05:33.790 --> 05:35.970
with opacity of zero point five.

05:36.160 --> 05:40.580
And then I have the capacity of zero as well as I have my visibility.

05:40.690 --> 05:45.520
Now what would be the key difference you see has we're working with display of none.

05:45.580 --> 05:50.100
This is taken out out of the floor so we cannot even see it here.

05:50.110 --> 05:56.110
However as I'm hovering over the opacity I see that there is an element so the element is there we just

05:56.110 --> 05:58.240
cannot see it right now in the browser.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.150
How will we display none.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.500
We're taking totally out of the flow of our document.

06:03.520 --> 06:09.040
So even though I can see it technically that it is in the entrance email I cannot hover over it.

06:09.130 --> 06:10.240
I cannot select it.

06:10.270 --> 06:14.060
I cannot see it more in more detail hole with opacity.

06:14.060 --> 06:16.550
Only thing we're doing has was visibility.

06:16.570 --> 06:18.040
We're hiding that element.

06:18.100 --> 06:21.780
We're not taking out out of the normal flow of the document.

06:21.790 --> 06:23.400
So those would be the key differences.

06:23.590 --> 06:27.220
If you want to totally get rid of the element you would use display of none.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.670
So maybe head over let's back we have the display of none.

06:30.670 --> 06:37.170
That would totally take it out of the forward document if you would want to let's say changed the opacity

06:37.440 --> 06:42.540
changed the transparency you would use the opacity and choose some kind of value between 0 and 1.

06:42.720 --> 06:46.640
And if you just want to hide it you would say visibility have hidden.

06:46.650 --> 06:51.150
So those are the properties those are the values and that is in general how we would use them.
