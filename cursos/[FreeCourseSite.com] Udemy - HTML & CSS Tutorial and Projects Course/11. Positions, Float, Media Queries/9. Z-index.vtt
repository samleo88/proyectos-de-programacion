00:00.270 --> 00:07.230
Another interesting doozy is a Zen index in the CSX and what we're going to do is we're going set up

00:07.230 --> 00:11.420
some example with some images just so we can see a little bit better.

00:11.610 --> 00:17.470
And for this you know what I will gonna get rid of all this mumbo jumbo that we had before and see.

00:17.850 --> 00:24.000
First I'm gonna save it and in then indexation email we all gonna create maybe the same thing we can

00:24.000 --> 00:30.360
leave the dev but within Dev we'll gonna add some images now we're gonna start with the small one first

00:30.600 --> 00:35.190
and it doesn't really matter because we're gonna be changing the sizes and let's say here I'm gonna

00:35.190 --> 00:36.650
be looking for image.

00:36.640 --> 00:42.780
Now I'm going to start with the small one so I can just say small JPEG and let me add the class because

00:42.780 --> 00:47.110
we will gonna be adding some changes individually by each of the images.

00:47.220 --> 00:54.100
So let's copy and paste it first of all it's a class of number two and all can be locked in for class.

00:54.100 --> 00:57.480
And number three what else we can have.

00:57.480 --> 00:57.680
Okay.

00:57.720 --> 01:01.650
So we have small We obviously also want the big one.

01:01.830 --> 01:05.150
So I'm going to say big j peg and then let's look for the folder.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.700
And again just for simple reason that I would want them to be different.

01:08.700 --> 01:13.620
And then you know this was obviously not in a folder but in images and then we're looking for a folder

01:13.620 --> 01:14.400
image.

01:14.490 --> 01:16.710
First things first we would need to fix our slate.

01:16.710 --> 01:20.070
The with here the heights are just massive.

01:20.070 --> 01:22.760
So let's say for all the images I would like to have.

01:22.830 --> 01:26.640
I don't know with of two hundred pixels.

01:26.660 --> 01:29.100
Well let's try it out with 200 pixels.

01:29.100 --> 01:31.950
And right away the height of two hundred pixels.

01:32.190 --> 01:33.830
And we'll see what happens.

01:33.840 --> 01:39.480
So two hundred and two hundred and this is obviously a mess up is not what I want.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.080
Let's go back over here and let's save it.

01:42.210 --> 01:46.050
And now we have 200 by 200 so far so good.

01:46.200 --> 01:46.670
You know what.

01:46.770 --> 01:53.400
Maybe it's not so far so good because let's do maybe hundred pixels because that way this is gonna look

01:53.460 --> 01:55.260
a little bit more decent.

01:55.300 --> 01:55.890
So OK.

01:55.890 --> 01:56.840
Hundred but hundred.

01:57.270 --> 02:03.240
Now this is gonna look at what else I would like more for now let's just work with the div and let's

02:03.240 --> 02:09.210
say for the day of or maybe let's say banner since we have the class already I would want to have some

02:09.210 --> 02:10.260
margin.

02:10.380 --> 02:14.180
Now the margins are gonna be like 20 pixels all around.

02:14.190 --> 02:21.690
So there's going to be some margin and I would like to add some with let's say 70 viewers.

02:21.750 --> 02:28.850
That's gonna be my with as well as some height with some I don't know 70 view height.

02:29.020 --> 02:31.540
So 70 view heads let's say.

02:31.560 --> 02:37.680
So this would be my live and let me add the border right now and for the border I would like to add

02:37.770 --> 02:41.710
I don't know five pixels solid.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.290
Let's go with the red.

02:43.290 --> 02:47.370
So something like this just so we can see where the data is actually sitting.

02:47.370 --> 02:48.150
Excellent.

02:48.150 --> 02:48.960
You know what though.

02:49.050 --> 02:53.030
One thing missing we can maybe do with of a little bit wider.

02:53.130 --> 02:55.040
So this is going to look a little bit better.

02:55.140 --> 02:55.980
Now what.

02:55.980 --> 03:00.390
Well knowledge that stood out something else we're going to say position and since we already have covered

03:00.390 --> 03:03.180
position absolute let's say oh this is gonna look like.

03:03.750 --> 03:08.490
So what I'm saying for all the images that we're gonna have to position absolute and again we have already

03:08.490 --> 03:09.460
covered this.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.280
So now they're just sitting here.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.590
Now we have an added position relative yet.

03:13.590 --> 03:18.030
So that's maybe something we should do because we know that we have an ancestor.

03:18.030 --> 03:20.780
And for the answers there we would like to add position relative.

03:21.390 --> 03:25.340
And at the moment what I would like is to control them one by one.

03:25.370 --> 03:31.390
So since I have classes there is gonna be the image with the class of one and then image with obviously

03:31.410 --> 03:35.740
class of two and three and let's just first start by positioning them.

03:35.850 --> 03:42.390
So for the image number one I'm going to say top there's gonna be zero left is gonna be zero then what

03:42.390 --> 03:43.740
else we're gonna have.

03:43.740 --> 03:47.820
Now let's just copy and paste it let's say 2 and 3.

03:47.820 --> 03:53.000
And then lastly here we would need to change different classes than zero.

03:53.070 --> 03:53.300
Right.

03:53.310 --> 03:54.280
Number three.

03:54.420 --> 03:57.180
And then here we're going to have different positions.

03:57.180 --> 04:02.970
So let's say for number two I would want 10 percent 10 percent from the top 10 percent from the left.

04:03.180 --> 04:07.520
Same thing or here can do 10 percent from the left.

04:07.530 --> 04:16.080
And you know what for this guy maybe 20 percent from the top and 20 percent from the left and the moment

04:16.080 --> 04:17.600
we say well what happens.

04:17.760 --> 04:23.950
What we're noticing that we're having the images we have the image number one then the image number

04:23.950 --> 04:26.040
two and the image number three.

04:26.260 --> 04:30.960
And as we're looking at it we can see that the third one is closer to us.

04:31.060 --> 04:37.120
Now the reason for that is very simple because this was the third image but this would be the Zen next

04:37.120 --> 04:38.980
that we're controlling with.

04:39.040 --> 04:39.600
I'm sorry.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.800
The access that we're controlling within.

04:42.640 --> 04:49.180
And the reason why the third one is gonna be the closer because the actual image was the third in line

04:49.540 --> 04:56.650
and the first one was further away or is further away because it was first on the line.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.270
So how we can change that.

04:58.270 --> 05:04.410
Well we know that we have the option of working with ze index that would control this Xie act.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.710
And why don't we test it up.

05:06.730 --> 05:09.460
Why don't we have a look of how this is gonna work.

05:09.580 --> 05:13.340
So let's say for number one we would want to work with Zen.

05:13.720 --> 05:19.330
Now one thing that I would need to let you know right away is that we've seen X automatically all gonna

05:19.360 --> 05:20.240
be getting zero.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.330
So all of them by default are gonna have zero.

05:23.350 --> 05:28.870
So even though I'm gonna add for the first one zero nothing is gonna change because the rest of them

05:28.870 --> 05:32.230
also right away have the easy index of zero.

05:32.230 --> 05:38.200
So instead of what I would like to do either I need to go bigger zero so in my case I could go to 1

05:38.620 --> 05:39.910
and check this out.

05:39.910 --> 05:47.350
Now my first one is actually closer to us because we increase this Zen x value on the Zen x property

05:47.800 --> 05:54.520
or we can do something like this if we know that all of them are by default 0 in a way it doesn't really

05:54.520 --> 05:54.850
matter.

05:54.850 --> 06:00.250
I can just say that this was gonna stay zero which again would be the default and then we can say Zen

06:00.250 --> 06:01.910
X negative 1.

06:02.020 --> 06:07.460
So that would be for this guy and then for the third one this is gonna be seen next number two.

06:07.480 --> 06:11.680
So the index and we can just go negative now what do we see.

06:11.680 --> 06:17.620
We see that the first one even though this shouldn't be like that normally is displayed closer to us

06:18.140 --> 06:21.730
than the second one is further a little bit away.

06:21.730 --> 06:25.890
And the third one we're controlling here with the index of negative 2.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.970
So this one is further and further away.

06:28.320 --> 06:34.120
And like I said even if I'm gonna come on this out by default this is how it works with z index of zero.

06:34.150 --> 06:37.430
So that's that's the reason why this is going gonna be displayed closer.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.520
Now we can have all kinds of values here.

06:39.540 --> 06:40.450
It doesn't really matter.

06:40.450 --> 06:45.320
You can write something like this nine hundred ninety nine as long as this value.

06:45.640 --> 06:52.690
And obviously this is the case if you want to place this one behind the element number two is more negative

06:52.780 --> 06:53.560
than this guy.

06:53.950 --> 06:59.510
So instead if I'm gonna write let's say nine hundred and this one I'm going to say nine hundred one

06:59.920 --> 07:02.140
then you can already guess what's going to happen.

07:02.680 --> 07:09.520
So now the third image is gonna be displayed closer to us than the one that is number two because we

07:09.520 --> 07:11.580
changed the z index values.

07:11.650 --> 07:17.080
However there is one kicker about disease index and that is the simple fact that it will only gonna

07:17.080 --> 07:23.380
work if you're going to have position relative or position absolute meaning it's not gonna work with

07:23.380 --> 07:24.190
position static.

07:24.580 --> 07:30.010
So let's have a look at how this is going to work and in our case what we can do well we can go back

07:30.010 --> 07:33.940
again to negative 1 as well as negative 2.

07:34.210 --> 07:37.660
Let's do something like this and this would be negative too.

07:37.810 --> 07:44.080
You can save it and you know what maybe let's flip around and let's say that we would want I don't know

07:44.320 --> 07:45.000
to be shot.

07:45.690 --> 07:47.470
Okay so how this is gonna work.

07:47.710 --> 07:52.140
Well we can do an opposition static right because we added the.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.740
For all the images we had of this position absolutely.

07:54.790 --> 07:55.330
So what if.

07:55.330 --> 08:01.600
Why don't we go back and why don't we say that for the number two we would like to add positions that

08:02.800 --> 08:03.270
OK.

08:03.300 --> 08:04.540
So far so good.

08:04.590 --> 08:07.170
So this image is still gonna be a front.

08:07.200 --> 08:12.580
But then let's say in this case we're gonna change this and we're gonna say that you know what the z

08:12.580 --> 08:16.040
index is not going to be negative but instead of we're gonna go with a positive.

08:16.290 --> 08:21.020
And we're also gonna go with this guy being positive so we can do something like this.

08:21.030 --> 08:24.810
So now again we have pretty much default look like we had anyway.

08:24.810 --> 08:27.020
But you know what I would say hmm.

08:27.360 --> 08:32.800
I don't like this even though I still have the static one I would like to have design X in my case I'm

08:32.800 --> 08:37.920
going to say design next is gonna be hundred just so I'm making sure that this would be bigger than

08:37.920 --> 08:43.710
the previous two and nothing changes the moment we save it because it's not gonna work on the static

08:43.710 --> 08:44.400
one.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.580
So we cannot do the static one with AC next.

08:47.680 --> 08:53.880
However if we're gonna change this one relative I say this is gonna be our up front because we can use

08:53.880 --> 08:56.370
it with relative as well as with absolute.
