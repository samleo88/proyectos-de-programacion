WEBVTT

00:00.620 --> 00:01.310
Excellent.

00:01.340 --> 00:04.750
Once we have covered how we can name our grid lines.

00:04.920 --> 00:08.390
Next why don't we talk about the grid template areas.

00:08.720 --> 00:15.620
And I guess the easiest way how I could explain grid template areas is the fact that we're still going

00:15.620 --> 00:19.160
to set up our columns and the rows.

00:19.310 --> 00:26.810
But what we're gonna do is for each and every item for each and every cell we are going to sign some

00:26.810 --> 00:28.410
kind of name value.

00:28.670 --> 00:35.480
And then we're going to set up our areas and then we're just going to place our particular cell within

00:35.480 --> 00:37.270
that particular area.

00:37.620 --> 00:41.110
Now it sounds a little bit more complicated than it really is.

00:41.180 --> 00:44.160
And in order to help us understand it better.

00:44.210 --> 00:50.180
In fact we're going to create this type of layout where we're going to have cell number one and that's

00:50.180 --> 00:58.410
going to be spending like this then cell number two and then cell number three four and five and six.

00:58.910 --> 01:04.370
And of course as we're going to be working then I'm gonna cover everything in more detail.

01:04.370 --> 01:11.030
Now I also want to let you know right away that remember we had display area names and this is exactly

01:11.030 --> 01:12.390
what we're going to cover.

01:12.410 --> 01:18.470
So if I'm going to show my grid you're going to notice that there is going to be some areas and those

01:18.500 --> 01:20.720
areas are going to have names.

01:20.720 --> 01:23.170
So in all this this would be let's say area 8.

01:23.180 --> 01:24.300
And by the way you can name this.

01:24.310 --> 01:31.930
How are you like this would be Area B and then we have C and D and E and F.

01:32.390 --> 01:39.260
Now let's start very very simply by just deleting everything that we had before.

01:39.380 --> 01:47.090
Like so as long as we don't care about the cell number one currently and nine why don't we delete the

01:47.120 --> 01:53.180
cell number seven and add one more class so cell number six.

01:53.300 --> 01:56.640
But then we need to start thinking.

01:56.900 --> 02:02.200
So how many rows and columns we're gonna have that's always gonna be your first question.

02:02.270 --> 02:07.460
And by the way we are cheating already a little bit because we can clearly see of how many rows and

02:07.460 --> 02:10.770
items we're gonna have if we make this a little bit harder.

02:10.880 --> 02:15.800
And now technically we would need to figure it out so I can tell already.

02:15.800 --> 02:16.270
Okay.

02:16.280 --> 02:24.350
So if as I'm looking at my columns now it is a little bit harder for me to see right now because everything

02:24.350 --> 02:28.290
is using the fractions but I could kind of already guessed that.

02:28.280 --> 02:34.340
Let's say this is going to be my column and the way I can tell that is known as this would be my grade

02:34.940 --> 02:41.540
column line like so here and then I would have my second column line here correct.

02:42.020 --> 02:44.730
So as I'm looking at it how many columns would I have.

02:44.750 --> 02:48.760
1 2 and 3 correct.

02:48.900 --> 02:55.820
Then we can turn it on and clearly we can see I will be my column number one column number two column

02:55.820 --> 02:57.130
number three.

02:57.200 --> 03:03.110
And I can see that we are technically using fractions correct because all of them are equally sized.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.790
Now doesn't really matter the size right now of the columns.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.880
This is really not the point of the video.

03:07.910 --> 03:12.950
The point of the video is not for you to guess how wide the columns would be but I'm just trying to

03:12.980 --> 03:16.520
kind of give you the general idea.

03:16.520 --> 03:17.900
So we have three columns.

03:17.900 --> 03:24.920
Okay then let's head over back to our grid and let's say a grid template columns and I'm gonna go with

03:24.920 --> 03:29.680
one fraction one fraction and one fraction.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.890
That's my initial layout.

03:31.910 --> 03:35.390
Now the moment I set this up I'm going to have something like this.

03:35.510 --> 03:36.920
That's a good start.

03:36.960 --> 03:40.160
And you know what I think I can just get her the margins as well.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.020
Let's do it this way.

03:41.020 --> 03:42.540
Let's get her on the margins.

03:42.540 --> 03:43.290
Okay.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.340
Now next one up.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.250
We need to decide well how many rows we have.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.010
And that is also very important.

03:49.070 --> 03:51.060
So let's think about it.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.110
You can see that this would be one row.

03:53.480 --> 03:57.740
So probably here I would have two of them correct or have row number one.

03:57.740 --> 03:58.910
Rule number two.

03:59.090 --> 04:03.050
Rule number three four and five.

04:03.050 --> 04:08.180
So it is three rows and I can come up with whatever values I would like.

04:08.180 --> 04:20.770
So I'm going to go grid template rows and let's go with hundred pixels on our pixels pixels on red pixels

04:21.220 --> 04:25.540
pixels and you guessed it hundred pixels.

04:25.780 --> 04:33.320
And once we set up our columns as well as the rows you know what I would like to remove this mean height.

04:33.720 --> 04:34.770
Like so.

04:34.810 --> 04:37.910
And when we do that we can see that.

04:38.050 --> 04:42.310
Well what we have right now is rule number three.

04:42.340 --> 04:45.600
Rule number four and rule number five.

04:45.610 --> 04:49.660
Now the way we work with great template areas is following.

04:49.660 --> 04:54.500
So we write a property by the name of grid template areas.

04:54.610 --> 05:00.070
Then we could technically write this in this line but it is going to be easier if you're going to start

05:00.130 --> 05:01.150
a new line.

05:01.210 --> 05:07.180
So let me start a new line and then essentially what you're doing is you are setting up your rows.

05:07.510 --> 05:11.140
So within the columns you're going to have your row.

05:11.470 --> 05:13.730
So this is going to be your number one.

05:13.810 --> 05:18.910
And what I'm going to do since we have five rows I'm just going to copy and paste that and then instead

05:18.910 --> 05:23.860
of using the grid lines in fact we are setting up the area.

05:24.340 --> 05:29.020
So what I'm going to say right now and again we can name this whole like but I'm just going to go with

05:29.080 --> 05:32.230
a letters because it's just gonna be the fastest one.

05:32.310 --> 05:37.210
But of course you can name to something like this area number one or something like that but I'm just

05:37.210 --> 05:41.260
going to go with a a and then B.

05:41.470 --> 05:48.310
So essentially what I'm saying you know what there is going to be Aryeh and Aryeh and then there's going

05:48.310 --> 05:50.370
to be Area B.

05:50.920 --> 05:55.920
Then I'm gonna continue next line and I'm gonna say that there's still going to be this area.

05:55.930 --> 06:00.040
Ay ay ay ay and b analogy think about it.

06:00.430 --> 06:01.690
So what happens here.

06:01.750 --> 06:09.970
Now I have this area where it starts with a column no one goes to Column number two but then it also

06:09.970 --> 06:13.240
continues here within the second row.

06:13.420 --> 06:14.120
Correct.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.720
That's how this area comes about.

06:16.780 --> 06:24.470
And then for area number B well or not no b the area with a value of B Well it is going to be here.

06:24.540 --> 06:26.530
That's the reason why I set this up.

06:26.530 --> 06:29.020
Notice I have b b b.

06:29.020 --> 06:32.940
Now I haven't set this up still in Rule number three.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.730
And the reason why I only have two rows.

06:35.890 --> 06:42.640
But hopefully you're getting the idea where essentially we're just setting up the areas and then eventually

06:42.640 --> 06:48.640
we're just going to use these values for ourselves and assign that particular cell to that particular

06:48.820 --> 06:52.070
area right now in this case what I would like to do.

06:52.150 --> 06:58.390
Well I would like to place a c c so there's gonna be some area C and then I'm going to continue with

06:58.390 --> 06:59.240
this B.

06:59.290 --> 07:05.560
Now if I really wanted to I could go B all the way right as long as I keep on adding within that column

07:05.860 --> 07:12.310
within that particular row and I would also like to mention that when we are signing had the values

07:12.310 --> 07:16.480
for the areas it is important like I said we keep the rows.

07:16.540 --> 07:18.220
So the way how we have rows.

07:18.310 --> 07:24.400
So if you have five rows This is exactly what we should have we should have five of these quotation

07:24.400 --> 07:25.120
marks.

07:25.720 --> 07:33.640
And then wherever we place as that area within that particular row follow the syntax of how many columns

07:34.090 --> 07:37.360
the reason is if I have three columns.

07:37.360 --> 07:42.700
That's the reason why I'm setting up a b if I would have only two columns then I would need to say well

07:42.730 --> 07:45.100
either a B or A or something like that.

07:45.550 --> 07:51.610
So keep in mind you're keeping track of how many rows you have as well as how many columns you have

07:52.090 --> 07:59.170
you're not just setting this willy nilly mallards do C C so area for the first column second column

07:59.170 --> 08:03.440
in the row three is going to be S.C. and then I'm gonna continue with the B.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.820
So my B is going to be in the first column the third.

08:07.120 --> 08:07.810
I'm sorry.

08:07.810 --> 08:14.740
First row third column second row third column and third row third column then what else we have what

08:14.800 --> 08:16.740
we have D and D.

08:16.870 --> 08:22.990
So this is gonna be spanning all across and just so you don't think I'm cheating can actually delete

08:22.990 --> 08:33.910
that or remove the grid and then let's do DDD and then let's write e f f as far as my columns are concerned

08:34.420 --> 08:39.910
and then once we have set up the areas it's really the easiest thing where I could just set up cell

08:39.910 --> 08:45.820
number one and I can say you know what cell number one you are going to be grid area and that's the

08:45.820 --> 08:49.200
property and the value of a lot set.

08:49.290 --> 08:54.060
What happens this cell number one is right now placed within this area.

08:54.220 --> 08:55.540
Ay ay.

08:55.670 --> 09:01.780
And like I said we can set up however we would like these areas.

09:01.970 --> 09:07.870
And this is just the way I chose to set it up and we also can of course place a different cell within

09:07.870 --> 09:08.290
there.

09:08.350 --> 09:12.000
It's not like I'm limited in cell number one and do something like this.

09:12.060 --> 09:18.580
We can have a cell number six sitting within this area because the only thing I'm doing just assigning

09:18.580 --> 09:21.270
the area for my particular cell.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.700
Now you don't believe me.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.870
Now let's do B all the way down here.

09:24.940 --> 09:25.990
Something like that.

09:25.990 --> 09:28.190
Now I'm going to change it to cell number one.

09:28.270 --> 09:36.520
We had no particular reason just because I like to a man why don't we change the cell number two and

09:36.520 --> 09:40.390
give it a B like so now what do you see here.

09:40.440 --> 09:48.820
I see that I have cell then I have area of BBB and I just assign it to a cell number to use it now I

09:48.820 --> 09:55.870
could go back to see Nick so and I'm gonna have that layer now stuff is going to break right now because

09:55.930 --> 10:02.580
of course we haven't finished everything as well as you notice how this B is just randomly sitting within

10:02.580 --> 10:10.500
a fourth row so we also need to be careful where when we are doing something well it needs to make sense.

10:10.500 --> 10:20.200
All right so we have BBB and we have C so let's assign it so cell number three is going to be great

10:20.200 --> 10:29.800
area of let's say C so and let's copy and paste it we're just gonna change these values where this is

10:29.800 --> 10:39.640
going to be for five as well as it probably should have copy and paste one more time six analysts just

10:39.670 --> 10:43.540
assign these areas now what's a.

10:43.570 --> 10:50.850
This would be C then we have a D and E. enough.

10:50.930 --> 10:52.110
And that's it.

10:52.140 --> 10:58.680
So the only thing we're doing is we're just setting up within our normal whatever cells we would want.

10:58.920 --> 11:03.310
And then of course what we're doing is we're just assigning this to the area.

11:03.360 --> 11:07.890
Keep in mind we could have done this how with naming are grid lines.

11:07.890 --> 11:13.800
Or we could have just done it by in fact using the grid line numbers.

11:13.830 --> 11:17.700
This wasn't limited to just grid template areas.

11:17.790 --> 11:20.710
I just wanted to show you how grid template areas work.

11:20.730 --> 11:24.130
That's the reason why I came up with this particular example.

11:24.510 --> 11:29.470
But again please keep in mind we do need to know how many columns we're gonna have.

11:29.530 --> 11:30.980
I mean in rows we're gonna have.

11:31.350 --> 11:37.400
And then we set up those areas and then we decide well how our layout is going to work.

11:37.560 --> 11:44.130
And then we're just gonna be placing whatever items we have within the Asian email within those particular

11:44.220 --> 11:44.730
areas.
