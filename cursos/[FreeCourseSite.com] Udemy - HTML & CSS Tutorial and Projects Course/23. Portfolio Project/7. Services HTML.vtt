WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:04.510
The next section you're going to be building is going to be services section.

00:04.770 --> 00:11.040
So here we're going to create our first title and actually we're going to reuse our title in the next

00:11.040 --> 00:17.460
sections or here like for this project and or here we're going to place a fantastic mark on when this

00:17.460 --> 00:20.200
is going to be taxed and there is going to be some other text.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.780
And they're also going to make some hover effect.

00:22.830 --> 00:28.020
So as you can see as I'm hovering over each and every service you can see that we're going to have a

00:28.020 --> 00:30.770
box with some box shatter.

00:31.140 --> 00:38.010
So let's go ahead and let's go to our index the amount and in the index age the amount we need to go

00:38.010 --> 00:44.890
where is the about section and or here and let's say that this is going to be a services section.

00:44.970 --> 00:51.830
So let's say we're comment services or section or Again copy and paste this on here.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.870
And let's say end of services section.

00:54.890 --> 00:57.330
Now what we would want or here in the section.

00:57.420 --> 01:06.040
Well first we're going to say section with a class of services services or here now also in this section.

01:06.210 --> 01:09.540
We're going to have like I said a title so section title.

01:09.580 --> 01:16.380
So this is going to be that we're going to create and reuse or here let's say section on here section

01:16.590 --> 01:17.420
title.

01:17.430 --> 01:23.250
Now again let's create another comment and we're going to say end of section right now what we would

01:23.250 --> 01:29.070
want in the section title sexually going to be very simple we're going to have a div with a class of

01:29.730 --> 01:32.250
section title.

01:32.460 --> 01:39.110
And inside there we're going to have a Heading 1 section title or here are going to be to underscore

01:39.110 --> 01:41.700
his name on here and for the name.

01:41.730 --> 01:47.940
In this case we're going to say services just like the name of our section or here again.

01:47.940 --> 01:54.060
Let me get back my helmet once I save it and if I scroll down on here you can see that I have my services

01:54.060 --> 01:54.930
title.

01:55.110 --> 01:58.980
I want to have the section title done next.

01:59.050 --> 02:05.310
What I actually want is the actual services and what I would want for the services first is the same

02:05.310 --> 02:09.150
as with and about oh we're going to want a service center.

02:09.150 --> 02:13.210
So this is going to serve here as a centering tool.

02:13.320 --> 02:18.490
So I'm going to say ready with a class of services center here within the div..

02:18.680 --> 02:21.120
We're going to start placing our services.

02:21.370 --> 02:24.820
Now first let's say that this is going to be single service.

02:25.220 --> 02:29.070
So first and foremost we're going to create each and every service.

02:29.250 --> 02:34.370
However it's going to just make it easier whenever we are copying pasting if we're going to have or

02:34.380 --> 02:40.710
hear these comments because we're going to make sure that we know where we are copying pasting your

02:40.820 --> 02:42.000
service.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.090
So these are going to be our two comments.

02:45.270 --> 02:51.290
Now here we're going to place first an article now in this article we would want is a.

02:51.490 --> 02:56.570
So this class is going to be like this so I'm going to say class and we're going to say services so

02:56.590 --> 03:00.530
services and services single service.

03:00.710 --> 03:05.790
So to all here underscores Singo on your service.

03:05.790 --> 03:11.430
So this is going to be the end on here once we will have this article or here.

03:11.460 --> 03:13.380
Now we want a few things.

03:13.530 --> 03:15.760
First what I want is the icon.

03:16.170 --> 03:21.030
So again let me just create a little bit more room for here and let's say Well here that this is going

03:21.030 --> 03:21.960
to be the icon.

03:22.040 --> 03:28.930
So I'm going to say this is going to be a day of with a class of what services we're here to underscores.

03:28.950 --> 03:31.470
Single service.

03:31.710 --> 03:36.460
And then we're going to call this icon or is this is going to be in my class and what I would want.

03:36.470 --> 03:45.930
And this is going to be element with a class of f a s and we're going to have FAA and Kalender on recherche.

03:46.020 --> 03:47.940
So this is going to be my fondest memory.

03:48.270 --> 03:55.500
So if I scroll down on here this is going to be my phone right now after this Dave out one text so I'm

03:55.500 --> 04:03.390
going to say we're heading to then we're going to have a services two underscores and single service

04:03.750 --> 04:05.860
and we're going to call this title on here.

04:05.910 --> 04:10.650
So this is going to be the single service title and here we're going to say this is going to be punctual

04:11.790 --> 04:17.080
like this so we can save it and sure enough this is going to be my next story.

04:17.220 --> 04:23.340
And then after that we will want the actual paragraph here and the last element that we are having is

04:23.340 --> 04:28.230
going to be paired off with a class of services with two underscores.

04:28.320 --> 04:32.110
Single service service.

04:32.160 --> 04:38.250
And let's just say or it text and or Again let's do something like 10 words like this.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.320
Let's say it.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.600
And sure enough now I can see that this is going to be my text.

04:42.630 --> 04:48.090
Now what I would want over here is I would want to create six of them so I'm going to go back over here

04:48.180 --> 04:54.690
to the top and I'm going to select this one service and I was going to copy and paste this five times

04:54.780 --> 04:57.410
one two three four five.

04:57.960 --> 05:03.150
Here what we would need is actually change the values for the font.

05:03.150 --> 05:03.940
Awesome.

05:03.960 --> 05:06.050
So the first one was calendar check.

05:06.270 --> 05:09.240
If we see or hear the next one is going to be a rocket.

05:09.540 --> 05:12.290
So let's say where is the first one.

05:12.300 --> 05:17.880
So this was a first service or it was our service single service.

05:17.880 --> 05:23.270
Now if we would want not a calendar check but actually we would want is a rocket.

05:23.340 --> 05:28.490
So I'm going to go back over here and we're going to write and this is going to be a rocket then we're

05:28.500 --> 05:32.890
going to say also going to change the actual name here.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.600
So I'm going to say that this is not going to be punctual.

05:35.610 --> 05:39.000
This is actually going to be creativity here.

05:39.140 --> 05:43.260
So I say this we keep on going we'll find the next one.

05:43.260 --> 05:48.830
Next one is actually going to be a mobile one here so we're going to find where is that account there

05:48.870 --> 05:49.590
check.

05:49.890 --> 05:55.140
And we're going to go over here and we're going to say this is not going to be Conder check.

05:55.140 --> 06:00.520
This is going to be immobile here and we can just check it whether we have it sure enough you can see

06:00.630 --> 06:06.600
this is going to be mobile and out here the text is also going to change and the text actually is going

06:06.600 --> 06:10.900
to say that this is going to be and this is going to be responsive in design.

06:11.190 --> 06:15.650
So responsive design really does.

06:15.750 --> 06:23.460
And once we have the mobile next one is going to be the Cong's and we're going to call this a hard work.

06:23.560 --> 06:26.750
We're here to say that this is going to be hard work.

06:26.790 --> 06:30.750
So Cong's you I on and on here for that text.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.810
We're going to say hard work.

06:32.890 --> 06:37.690
So you know like this when I say hard work order.

06:38.070 --> 06:42.750
Now once we save this then we have development and photography.

06:42.750 --> 06:46.210
So for that development we're going to have a laptop.

06:46.680 --> 06:50.490
So we're here once again to lead this their check.

06:50.650 --> 06:57.260
Let's say on your laptop like this and for the laptop we're going to say that this is going to be development

06:58.200 --> 07:07.640
and this development and once we have the development then the last one is going to be in photography.

07:07.640 --> 07:16.280
So I guess I'm going to say this is going to be a photography fee here and here we're going to have

07:16.310 --> 07:17.310
a camera.

07:17.660 --> 07:21.620
So the last one is going to be camera camera.

07:22.220 --> 07:29.240
And once we have more here are in the exchange e-mail now we are ready to go to the main says and starts

07:29.250 --> 07:29.610
dialing.
