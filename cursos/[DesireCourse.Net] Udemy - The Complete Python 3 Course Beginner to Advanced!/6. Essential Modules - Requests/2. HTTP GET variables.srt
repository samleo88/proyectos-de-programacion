00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,049
So in the last video we learned how to
make a request to Google and returning

2

00:00:04,049  -->  00:00:08,490
the homepage isn't really useful because we don't, I mean it's just a blank page.

3

00:00:08,490  -->  00:00:12,900
So what we're going to learn about in this
video is parameters and how to pass get

4

00:00:12,900  -->  00:00:18,720
variables, which they're known as in PHP,
into a web page. So if I do a search here,

5

00:00:18,720  -->  00:00:25,680
let's go to google, the actual google, and
let's search for "pizza" if I click up in

6

00:00:25,680  -->  00:00:32,579
here you'll notice that this gets added
to the are the URL, and if I do that

7

00:00:33,600  -->  00:00:41,160
it also does. So, what we're going to go
ahead and do, is this working? There we go.

8

00:00:41,160  -->  00:00:46,649
What we're going to go ahead and do is copy this, let me just see if I put the

9

00:00:46,649  -->  00:00:48,300
question mark in before that,

10

00:00:48,300  -->  00:00:51,899
ok that works too. Alright so we're going
to go ahead and copy this, this is the

11

00:00:51,899  -->  00:00:54,989
URL that we want, so what we're going to
do is we're going to add a parameter

12

00:00:54,989  -->  00:00:59,640
with the name of that, and it's going to be
equal to pizza. So, let's go over here, let's

13

00:00:59,640  -->  00:01:12,299
create a new variable called "params = {"#q":}" this is going to

14

00:01:12,299  -->  00:01:18,689
be the name of the variable, and then
actually don't need to add this,

15

00:01:18,689  -->  00:01:27,240
going to be searching for "pizza" and then
we're going to put a comma here and

16

00:01:27,240  -->  00:01:31,860
we're going to type ", params=params" and what this means is this is

17

00:01:31,860  -->  00:01:37,680
the key word that's going into this method, this is the argument, and this is

18

00:01:37,680  -->  00:01:41,790
our variable that we just created. So, if
we go ahead and save this and run it

19

00:01:41,790  -->  00:01:48,630
again, we should now get a different
webpage returned to us, and what I'm

20

00:01:48,630  -->  00:01:53,520
going to do it the page HTML i'm going
to go ahead and open it in Safari again,

21

00:01:53,520  -->  00:02:00,689
and that did not work. So let's go ahead
and troubleshoot this a bit.

22

00:02:01,409  -->  00:02:07,829
Let's go ahead and print the URL. So, see
what we're getting as a response here

23

00:02:07,829  -->  00:02:12,030
from the URL. So it's still adding this.

24

00:02:20,660  -->  00:02:26,570
Google might be a bad example for that,
let's go over to Bing. Let's try it with this.

25

00:02:26,570  -->  00:02:34,100
Let's search for "pizza" on Bing, let's look at the URL how its structured, if I remove

26

00:02:34,100  -->  00:02:40,220
everything but the pizza keyword it's
going to return it,

27

00:02:40,220  -->  00:02:45,470
so that's what we want it to do. So let's go
ahead and q=pizza so

28

00:02:45,470  -->  00:02:56,750
bing.com/search is the URL we're going to use, and simply is going to be Q equals

29

00:02:56,750  -->  00:03:05,990
pizza, so let's go ahead and save, rerun
this file, and now if I open page.HTML in

30

00:03:05,990  -->  00:03:12,080
the browser we should see a results page.
So I guess the way that Google

31

00:03:12,080  -->  00:03:18,590
uses javascript to generate the results, I guess that was interfering with the actual

32

00:03:18,590  -->  00:03:22,580
request that we were making to it, it just
returned blank page instead of the page

33

00:03:22,580  -->  00:03:28,850
with the content, and we actually can
account for JavaScript rendered data not

34

00:03:28,850  -->  00:03:32,420
by using request but using a few other
libraries that we're going to look at a

35

00:03:32,420  -->  00:03:32,930
bit later.
