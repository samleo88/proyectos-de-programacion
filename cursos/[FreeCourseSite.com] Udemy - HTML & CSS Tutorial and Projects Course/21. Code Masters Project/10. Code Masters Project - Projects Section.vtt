WEBVTT

00:00.430 --> 00:05.320
And the next section are going to be building is going to be all here in this project section right.

00:05.460 --> 00:09.390
And this one I'm going to do exclusively with A C is great.

00:09.440 --> 00:10.020
Right.

00:10.080 --> 00:14.430
So basically what we're going to do is we're going to have a blocks.

00:14.480 --> 00:19.080
All right we're going to have 10 blocks then we're going to set these back rooms right.

00:19.150 --> 00:22.740
And on some of them we're actually going to have them as background effects.

00:22.740 --> 00:23.310
Right.

00:23.310 --> 00:27.740
And I'm basically going to show you how we can do this using C Ss great.

00:27.810 --> 00:32.310
So we're going to go back over here and we're going to go back there and it's a shame now because that's

00:32.310 --> 00:34.160
the first thing that we would need to do.

00:34.410 --> 00:39.450
So here I'm going to create a comment and I'm going to say projects this is going to be project section

00:39.450 --> 00:44.900
that I'm going to select the whole line copied and pasted then I'm going to say end of projects right.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.200
So once we have this thing now I would want a section like this and I'm going to say first and this

00:52.200 --> 00:58.020
is going to have a class of project here and then we're going to have a idea of projects.

00:58.240 --> 01:06.180
So here when I say both ID and the class now once we have this now we want 10 articles so I'm going

01:06.180 --> 01:07.410
to say we're here.

01:07.410 --> 01:09.280
This is going to be a hard call right.

01:09.540 --> 01:15.000
And the article is going to be with two classes project like this.

01:15.240 --> 01:21.920
And also with the number so I'm going to say project here like this and let's say that this case I'm

01:21.930 --> 01:23.550
just going to leave it the way it is.

01:23.550 --> 01:24.150
All right.

01:24.150 --> 01:30.480
Plus tab now have article on here I'm going to write one right now I'm going to select the whole thing

01:30.840 --> 01:32.840
and let's say we're going to copy this one.

01:33.050 --> 01:37.680
And like I said we need number done so here and this is going to be number two.

01:37.880 --> 01:48.820
This is going to be number three number four number five six seven eight nine and over here last 110.

01:48.940 --> 01:51.680
Right so we did one too many.

01:51.690 --> 01:54.610
So we can just say on here that the lead is.

01:54.800 --> 02:00.670
I mean like I said we're going to be using serious as grade and going to be using the math runs right.

02:00.840 --> 02:04.910
So you can see how easy it actually is right in order to create something like this.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.120
This is all you need for ADHD.

02:07.500 --> 02:12.480
So save this and we're going to go back to Main this and we're going to start dialing.

02:12.510 --> 02:17.280
So here I'm going to have a project right here.

02:17.490 --> 02:20.900
So what are we going to do here and we're going to say like this.

02:20.900 --> 02:21.560
Right.

02:21.570 --> 02:31.320
So for the project like this we're going to have some setup right here and this is going to be projects

02:32.060 --> 02:33.340
hash stack.

02:33.570 --> 02:33.840
Right.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.290
And what would be durable.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.400
Well first of all what we're going to say like this.

02:37.410 --> 02:38.110
Right.

02:38.190 --> 02:44.680
So here we're going to say that the projects always are going to be hundred View Heights.

02:44.700 --> 02:45.100
Right.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.030
So this is going to be the first rule.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.210
So I'm going to say men right.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.810
And we're going to say hundred again.

02:51.870 --> 02:55.980
So this is always going to be spanning all across the screen.

02:56.270 --> 02:56.570
Right.

02:56.580 --> 02:59.490
Or you can see so this is going to be our project.

02:59.670 --> 03:06.450
Now after that we would want a display and we're going to say grade right and for sure what we're wanting

03:06.450 --> 03:08.620
to do is create more space right now.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.350
Right on this.

03:10.530 --> 03:19.160
And when working with grid I'm going to say green grid template one template and you're going to say

03:19.160 --> 03:25.760
columns like this I'm going to say repeat and we're going to say five and one for action.

03:25.760 --> 03:30.010
So basically what I'm saying is I want five equal columns are here.

03:30.110 --> 03:30.600
Right.

03:30.830 --> 03:32.030
And this is how we can do it.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.920
It's using a repeat function.

03:35.020 --> 03:37.160
And this is for the columns.

03:37.160 --> 03:43.680
But then we also went for the ropes so to say grade template and we're going to say Rose and that's

03:43.700 --> 03:49.220
going to be a repeat and this is going to be different because it's going to be four and then it's going

03:49.220 --> 03:50.850
to be one for action here.

03:50.890 --> 03:51.280
Right.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.430
So four of them.

03:52.610 --> 03:55.810
So we're getting the roles that the cops are in.

03:55.820 --> 04:02.090
So if you count or here right and one column or here this is going to be the second cone this is going

04:02.090 --> 04:03.190
to be the third.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.390
This is going to be the fourth and this is going to be our fight.

04:06.710 --> 04:12.130
Now just because these items are spanning all right this is what we're going to be creating would see

04:12.250 --> 04:13.190
as great.

04:13.450 --> 04:19.300
But the column number is actually five because it's one two three four five.

04:19.580 --> 04:26.710
Now the same goes for those see first row second row third row fourth row right.

04:26.810 --> 04:28.520
This is where I'm getting these numbers from.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.020
Right.

04:29.130 --> 04:32.720
And obviously it's something that you need to set it up how you would one right.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.640
I already know how I wanted.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.680
So that's why I said them like this right.

04:36.890 --> 04:41.440
If you would want a different lay out you would have to lay them out differently.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.210
Right.

04:42.220 --> 04:47.560
I know here what I'm going to say grade template and I'm going to say areas right.

04:47.660 --> 04:53.420
And the way we work with grid template areas we're going to have a quotation marks here basically right

04:53.690 --> 04:56.060
on where each item should go.

04:56.180 --> 05:00.990
So I'm going to say Item one here and one more here.

05:01.010 --> 05:03.730
Item two more here.

05:03.830 --> 05:08.550
Item three over here really like this where I'm getting this from.

05:08.550 --> 05:09.160
All right.

05:09.530 --> 05:10.290
So let's go back.

05:10.300 --> 05:10.930
All right.

05:10.940 --> 05:13.540
You can see I'm saying item one.

05:13.540 --> 05:18.540
First column item one still second column item 3 over here.

05:18.710 --> 05:19.100
I'm sorry.

05:19.100 --> 05:25.230
Add them to third column and Item three fourth and fifth column.

05:25.230 --> 05:25.650
All right.

05:25.730 --> 05:29.590
So you can see over here right 1 1 2 and 3.

05:29.690 --> 05:34.010
And what I'm going to do when we're here I'm going to select this line and we're just going to copy

05:34.010 --> 05:34.600
and paste this.

05:34.610 --> 05:35.210
Right.

05:35.300 --> 05:40.680
And since we have four rows right we should have four rows over here right.

05:40.770 --> 05:41.010
No.

05:41.020 --> 05:43.120
Here we're going to start changing the values.

05:43.300 --> 05:43.850
Right.

05:44.240 --> 05:47.350
And the way we change the values is here.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.660
This is going to be item number four.

05:49.890 --> 05:55.010
All right then we have a item 5 an item 5 right again.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.630
Let's look at where I'm getting this from.

05:56.630 --> 05:57.190
Right.

05:57.500 --> 06:05.440
So second row first column still item 1 still item 1 0 here.

06:05.450 --> 06:09.390
This was item number number for healing this.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.920
And then we have item 5 right here.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.660
Item 5 and this one is spanning or here like this.

06:15.660 --> 06:16.230
All right.

06:16.310 --> 06:18.390
So this is where we get this line from.

06:18.470 --> 06:26.170
Now what we have next then after that we have eight items six here and six.

06:26.390 --> 06:29.070
Item seven here.

06:29.340 --> 06:31.760
Item 7 or here.

06:31.900 --> 06:34.220
And then we have two fives again right.

06:34.380 --> 06:38.870
So again let's just check it out where we get this from Item 6.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.180
And this is going to span or here to next throw.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.660
But we don't care about this rule.

06:42.780 --> 06:48.590
We care about 3 6 7 7 and this one still has the 5 right.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.580
So this is spanning or here from this guy.

06:50.620 --> 06:51.310
Right.

06:51.360 --> 06:57.990
And then the last row is going to be Item 6 item 8 0 here.

06:58.380 --> 07:01.220
And then we have nine nine 10 right.

07:01.280 --> 07:05.680
So this is going to be 9 9 and 10.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.680
Now what about the actual lineups.

07:08.990 --> 07:13.300
So because you can see or hear I just said the grid template there.

07:13.330 --> 07:20.850
So right now the reason when we had had these classes on this project one project to project three right

07:21.260 --> 07:23.120
is because we're going to be targeting them.

07:23.150 --> 07:29.160
All right so I'm going to say project or here and I'm going to say project one like this.

07:29.430 --> 07:34.390
And when I'm going to say all here is this is going to be grid area right.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.390
And I would want this to be very.

07:36.510 --> 07:37.270
Right.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.460
This one over here for these two.

07:39.720 --> 07:39.910
Right.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.770
This is what I would care about.

07:41.980 --> 07:48.600
So I'm going to say or here I am one and what I would want or here is I'm going to have a background

07:49.380 --> 07:52.700
here and I'm going to say you are wrong on all images.

07:52.710 --> 07:58.070
Now honestly I have a ton of projects right so you can see that I have 10 images so I'm going to say

07:58.080 --> 08:01.850
number one more here we're going to say Center here.

08:01.850 --> 08:13.430
Cover cover here fixed here and no repeat no repeat or here now we can say this one over here and you

08:13.430 --> 08:15.380
can see that this is going to be fixed.

08:15.380 --> 08:17.060
This is going to be the fixed one right.

08:17.060 --> 08:21.620
Because you can see ASMS crawling them and just stay in the rest of them are not going to be fixed.

08:21.610 --> 08:22.050
Right.

08:22.070 --> 08:23.520
So there's going to be three of them.

08:23.720 --> 08:31.430
So this is why we have this fixed or now what we want to do is actually just copy and paste this again

08:31.460 --> 08:32.400
10 times.

08:32.410 --> 08:33.820
Well another nine.

08:33.820 --> 08:37.850
All right so to get a total of 10 and we're just going to have to change these values.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.190
That's all we will have to do.

08:39.380 --> 08:43.340
So here maybe we can do just so we don't need this.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.900
He does everything right.

08:44.900 --> 08:51.540
So we're going to delete these guys on here so we can just add these values on this and let's copy this

08:51.770 --> 08:52.820
10 times right.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.020
So one two three four five six seven eight nine.

08:57.280 --> 08:57.790
All right.

08:57.890 --> 09:05.820
So we have 10 of them and over here let's select this and let's actually make a little bit more clear.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.930
So we're going to say we're here to beautify right now.

09:09.020 --> 09:10.220
You can see that looks better.

09:10.230 --> 09:10.890
Right.

09:10.970 --> 09:15.240
So we have a project one item one on one here.

09:15.240 --> 09:23.390
This is going to be the projects and then for the grade project to add them to an order here.

09:23.390 --> 09:24.360
Item 2.

09:24.410 --> 09:27.520
Now the problem is I didn't need this fix though right.

09:27.650 --> 09:35.780
So I can get rid of this fixed then or here this is going to be number three or here and number three

09:35.780 --> 09:39.170
or here and number three are here.

09:39.170 --> 09:39.940
All right.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.690
Now again do we need this fix.

09:42.710 --> 09:44.190
No we don't need this fixed.

09:44.390 --> 09:49.640
So we're going to get rid of this guy and the next one that we need fixed is actually going to be number

09:49.640 --> 09:50.750
five on it.

09:50.750 --> 09:53.660
So for this go we can also get rid of it.

09:53.660 --> 09:54.320
All right.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.110
So can get rid of fixed.

09:56.150 --> 09:57.870
This is going to be number four.

09:57.950 --> 09:59.700
This is going to be number four.

09:59.760 --> 10:04.130
This is going to be number four and you can see that pretty much is because they are easily numbered

10:04.130 --> 10:04.980
them like this right.

10:04.980 --> 10:09.790
So Project 4 is going to have project for you could get a different background right.

10:09.790 --> 10:15.560
It doesn't really matter how you would work and just remember that for whatever item you want to place

10:15.560 --> 10:16.520
an hour here right.

10:16.670 --> 10:19.870
It makes sense if you actually numbered them the same way.

10:19.870 --> 10:20.550
Right.

10:20.570 --> 10:26.490
So item 5 and 5 and item 5 again let's delete fixed or you know what.

10:26.490 --> 10:28.360
No this one actually states sorry.

10:28.460 --> 10:33.410
And then over here let's check the last one that's actually going to have fixed which is going to be

10:33.500 --> 10:34.300
8.

10:34.520 --> 10:39.800
So this five six seven eight and the rest of them we're going to do it right.

10:39.830 --> 10:43.120
So this is going to be deleting fixed right.

10:43.140 --> 10:48.380
I can see that I made a mistake I should have probably copied without a fix and this would actually

10:48.380 --> 10:49.280
make more sense.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.010
Right.

10:50.090 --> 10:52.700
And here it's just these values.

10:52.760 --> 11:08.110
So again six or six and six this is going to be 7 7 7 or 8 8 8.

11:08.360 --> 11:13.440
Then will have a 9 9 0 9.

11:13.700 --> 11:18.590
And this is going to be 10 10 10.

11:18.660 --> 11:20.220
I don't last one time.

11:20.570 --> 11:21.480
Right.

11:21.710 --> 11:26.780
What we would want to do is we would want to add a little bit of Pasotti as we're hovering.

11:26.990 --> 11:33.440
So I'm going to say we're here project or here and I'm going to say transition and transition is going

11:33.440 --> 11:34.610
to be Pasotti.

11:34.810 --> 11:37.860
We're going to say two seconds is all here like this.

11:38.120 --> 11:44.660
And as we were hovering the capacity is going to change so I'm going to say project here.

11:44.730 --> 11:47.640
However.

11:48.140 --> 11:58.160
And this is going to be opacity 0.5 0.5 or whatever and cursor pointer or hair like this.

11:58.180 --> 12:00.120
All right let's say this.

12:00.260 --> 12:01.290
Here like this.

12:01.330 --> 12:03.260
Now let's go back over here and check it out.

12:03.270 --> 12:03.940
We have.

12:04.130 --> 12:04.470
All right.

12:04.510 --> 12:05.990
Well we're going to refresh.

12:06.180 --> 12:09.630
We're actually we were rushing that's already made.

12:09.700 --> 12:12.580
Let's go back over here and let's refresh our here.

12:12.580 --> 12:13.250
All right.

12:13.420 --> 12:18.620
And now I can see that there is some kind of mistake because it's not working right.

12:18.640 --> 12:21.770
So let's go ahead and let's find out what it is.

12:21.780 --> 12:22.410
Right.

12:22.600 --> 12:29.890
So if we have all read projects right let's make sure that index actually was working right and we had

12:29.980 --> 12:37.960
a project on here this was a project 1 and let's go back to main success and you can see my mistake

12:38.130 --> 12:38.820
right.

12:38.890 --> 12:42.400
I didn't have project or here right.

12:42.410 --> 12:48.700
So I copied and paste them all right I actually wrote a different wrong name.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.320
Right so I need to get rid of the.

12:51.430 --> 12:52.300
All right.

12:52.390 --> 12:55.170
So again I'm sorry for this right.

12:55.540 --> 13:02.800
I just messed up over here and nine and 10 right and now we have the project.

13:02.890 --> 13:04.490
So let's refresh now.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.290
This should be working right.

13:06.340 --> 13:10.030
And sure enough now you can see that we have a grid right.

13:10.080 --> 13:15.670
You can see that these ones are going to be actually we're transparent right.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.700
Not only starting at transparencies that are going to be fixed.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.770
All right I can see how they image things.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.760
And these won't be right.

13:22.810 --> 13:25.230
Now let me show you also one more thing right.

13:25.250 --> 13:28.180
Remember how we had this background or here right.

13:28.180 --> 13:30.040
This dark background right.

13:30.250 --> 13:33.790
So now let me show you why we had a z index.

13:33.790 --> 13:39.480
So let me scroll back up and find where is the nav number the z index.

13:39.490 --> 13:40.000
Right.

13:40.300 --> 13:45.610
And maybe let's add this Nav. a little bit darker background.

13:45.740 --> 13:50.360
So it's something like 9 you 8.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.750
So we can see it better.

13:51.970 --> 13:54.340
Let's say this and let's come on top.

13:54.340 --> 13:55.770
This is the index.

13:55.780 --> 13:59.330
Let's do this and see what happens with this clip effect.

13:59.340 --> 13:59.920
All right.

14:00.130 --> 14:06.420
So what happens is you see we're here I have my nav All right it does have this back black background.

14:06.580 --> 14:12.430
I'm scrolling scrolling and look what happens to them as I get to the clip or here right.

14:12.490 --> 14:13.750
You can see it disappears.

14:13.790 --> 14:14.300
Right.

14:14.410 --> 14:16.380
If I don't have the zone you can see right.

14:16.660 --> 14:19.590
This clip actually goes on top.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.150
All right.

14:20.230 --> 14:23.780
This is why would we would need or here is the Zendiks.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.730
That's the reason why we're using this.

14:25.780 --> 14:30.200
And obviously if all the numbers are zero you need a bigger number than zero.

14:30.200 --> 14:30.580
All right.

14:30.730 --> 14:33.030
So in this case I just set it down.

14:33.130 --> 14:40.410
But if you had clip path let's say this about image's you would add a bigger z index right.

14:40.420 --> 14:41.860
This would do the same thing.

14:41.860 --> 14:43.090
Now I refresh.

14:43.420 --> 14:44.500
You can see right now.

14:44.500 --> 14:50.210
All right now what's happening is obviously I didn't say it when I saved it.

14:50.220 --> 14:57.850
Now I can see that actual Now bar is spanning over to right as you as you're hovering right.

14:57.850 --> 14:59.420
It's not disappearing anymore.

14:59.770 --> 15:01.580
So that's the reason for the Zendiks.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.400
Now we ready to work on the next section.
