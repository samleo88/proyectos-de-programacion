WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:06.930
And now that we have added a toggle bottom or here on the top there's actually few more things that

00:06.930 --> 00:09.850
I would want to do with a nav bar.

00:09.870 --> 00:15.750
First of all I would want to hide these links here by default right so they wouldn't be showing because

00:15.750 --> 00:21.600
right now at the moment we go to the smaller screen or here you can see that once we actually go to

00:21.600 --> 00:25.360
the small screen you can see right away that we have the links or here right.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.580
That would be the first thing.

00:26.580 --> 00:29.060
Right so I would actually want to hide them by default.

00:29.280 --> 00:36.300
Then I would actually want that as we're scrolling down are now bar actually stays in a document right

00:36.300 --> 00:38.140
so it can always click two things.

00:38.280 --> 00:41.210
And then the last thing I would want a smooth scrolling.

00:41.310 --> 00:44.900
Now you can see right away that this video I'm recording actually later.

00:44.970 --> 00:45.170
Right.

00:45.180 --> 00:48.120
Because you can see that I already have a few sections on here.

00:48.290 --> 00:54.300
However it doesn't mean that we're not going to be following in order with the next sections right because

00:54.300 --> 01:00.400
these things we can add any time and I was actually debating whether to include this or not.

01:00.400 --> 01:06.870
Because if it includes javascript and trickery but as you can see that I finally actually decided to

01:06.870 --> 01:12.060
include this so don't worry that you see things that you're going to be actually creating and next videos

01:12.480 --> 01:18.550
because again this is not going to mess up or order or in any way or shape or form.

01:18.750 --> 01:22.870
So the first thing that I would do I would want to hide this by default.

01:23.130 --> 01:24.670
It's actually very simple.

01:24.750 --> 01:29.340
I'm going to go back to my sources over here and you can see that I have a now.

01:29.630 --> 01:32.250
Well over here like this one that has a list.

01:32.310 --> 01:33.750
I have none right.

01:33.750 --> 01:38.840
And you can see why I'm interested in this guy here right because I would want to hear this now.

01:38.870 --> 01:39.660
Logan right.

01:39.810 --> 01:41.340
But these links I wouldn't want.

01:41.360 --> 01:41.690
Right.

01:41.730 --> 01:46.920
These ones I would want to hide so I'm going to say we're here right away by default since we have a

01:46.920 --> 01:48.540
more biol first design.

01:48.540 --> 01:54.740
Right so we're designing for I'm going to say we're here to play and I'm going to say none of this.

01:54.810 --> 01:55.320
Right.

01:55.350 --> 01:56.160
Simple enough.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.340
And now you can see that by default it's not showing.

01:59.520 --> 02:05.030
However the moment I actually have it all here right you can see that it's actually popping up all right.

02:05.040 --> 02:10.830
So this is how I would want the next thing that I would want is actually have it over here right.

02:11.020 --> 02:16.200
You see or hear these phantasm and you can see that right now they are separate links right.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.750
Actually I want them in one separate line.

02:18.870 --> 02:21.360
So the way I'm going to do this I'm going to over here.

02:21.380 --> 02:27.370
This is going to be a hash tag and have then you l l y and I'm going to say last of type.

02:27.480 --> 02:27.890
Right.

02:27.960 --> 02:33.420
Because if you are going to go back all you can see that this class Elyot class is actually the last

02:33.540 --> 02:34.140
line.

02:34.370 --> 02:40.920
So I'm going to say we're here and this is going to be a last of type here last type and all here we're

02:41.100 --> 02:47.290
going to write first we're going to say this play and I'm going to say flex on me like this.

02:47.360 --> 02:53.500
Then we're going to have a justified content and we're going to say let's say space between here like

02:53.700 --> 02:56.880
this and you can see that we have few options right.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.670
We actually at the end we might actually delete this just can't.

03:00.680 --> 03:07.410
And if you don't like it or here we're just going to have a background and we're going to say is the

03:07.410 --> 03:09.020
background is going to be discarded.

03:09.210 --> 03:13.020
And so that's one way how to actually do this and say background.

03:13.170 --> 03:17.380
I'm going to say the same as legs over here so it can be too easy.

03:17.560 --> 03:21.640
And I now have 2 8 2 and that's going to be another.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.130
Well that's right.

03:23.140 --> 03:26.130
So this would be one way how we could actually do this.

03:26.130 --> 03:29.370
Now the issue here is maybe you don't like that as you were hovering right.

03:29.490 --> 03:31.950
You can see that that technically the links are so small.

03:31.960 --> 03:32.600
Right.

03:32.670 --> 03:38.760
So in order to do that I could actually if I would want them to be actually spanning all across I could

03:38.760 --> 03:41.420
actually read or hear a comment.

03:41.630 --> 03:41.920
Right.

03:41.970 --> 03:46.310
And what I'm going to do here I'm going to come in these background colors on like this.

03:46.320 --> 03:46.630
Right.

03:46.630 --> 03:48.850
So I'm going to come and this one out.

03:49.100 --> 03:56.100
And actually what I can do is I can have a last of type and I can work with the legs because links are

03:56.100 --> 03:59.580
children or here of this last of Type II.

03:59.630 --> 04:00.170
All right.

04:00.170 --> 04:02.180
So I'm going to say copy and I'm used.

04:02.230 --> 04:07.680
I'm going to use the flex properties and it's the last of type A more here and this but I'm going to

04:07.680 --> 04:08.780
say flex.

04:08.820 --> 04:10.790
Now I'm going to say one more here right.

04:10.800 --> 04:15.990
And I can see that they're growing as much as they have to or here I'm going right and they shouldn't

04:15.990 --> 04:17.330
shrink at all.

04:17.330 --> 04:19.010
All right so they shouldn't be like this.

04:19.180 --> 04:20.990
And here hero can just say.

04:21.030 --> 04:21.570
All right.

04:21.570 --> 04:24.380
So Flex braces is going to be an or here.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.980
Another thing that I would want maybe text a line.

04:27.150 --> 04:29.410
I'm going to say center like this.

04:29.430 --> 04:31.040
No not inherit.

04:31.050 --> 04:32.460
I'm going to say central here.

04:32.460 --> 04:33.040
Right.

04:33.120 --> 04:39.060
And you can see what happens right now as I'm hovering right I actually have the actual link.

04:39.320 --> 04:39.780
All right.

04:39.980 --> 04:47.060
And you can see that actual link is taking up the block right now just a small piece of a lie.

04:47.220 --> 04:52.910
And again if you don't like this kind of you you can obviously go with the just if I counted spade spacing

04:52.910 --> 04:58.260
between back right and again the nice thing is that this is going to be happening by default.

04:58.260 --> 04:58.770
Right.

04:58.770 --> 05:01.440
So it's actually hiding first.

05:01.480 --> 05:10.180
Now the next thing that I would want to do is actually work here with the fact that the actual were

05:10.180 --> 05:14.680
here this not by right I would actually want it to show.

05:14.680 --> 05:14.940
Right.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.430
So has them scrolling now.

05:16.620 --> 05:21.370
I would want this to show actual number and how I would do that.

05:21.450 --> 05:25.550
I mean first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a new class right.

05:25.610 --> 05:31.700
I'm going to go here the last class I'm going to say or here new and I'm going to say Now have you.

05:31.700 --> 05:38.230
Now for you and for this class I'm going to say position and I'm going to say fixed fixed door here

05:38.620 --> 05:42.360
then I'm going to say with that I would want a hundred you.

05:42.520 --> 05:44.490
You were all like this.

05:44.680 --> 05:45.940
And then the z index.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.790
I'm going to say 10 right and I got it.

05:48.790 --> 05:51.340
I'm going to show all these things why am I doing them right.

05:51.340 --> 05:52.390
One by one.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.440
Important.

05:53.440 --> 05:57.820
All right here we would need to add important just override it like this.

05:57.970 --> 06:04.000
And then we save it and now I would want to do is I would want to apply this class to the now more as

06:04.000 --> 06:05.660
I'm starting to scroll down.

06:05.800 --> 06:12.710
So not just by default I actually want to scroll a little bit and then add this class to the nav bar.

06:12.730 --> 06:18.480
So the way I would do that I would actually go to the script and I'm going to have to write some rules

06:18.720 --> 06:19.780
here.

06:20.050 --> 06:26.700
And the first thing that I'm going to say is how do I want to select the when no it's I'm going to say

06:26.730 --> 06:31.920
a dollar sign here I'm going to write and we know that I'm going to say scroll.

06:32.040 --> 06:38.280
So this is going to be the scroll method here scroll like this and then I'm going to write a function.

06:38.480 --> 06:38.710
Right.

06:38.770 --> 06:45.020
So something should happen as I'm scrolling and the function you can see in this is going to be a an

06:45.060 --> 06:46.680
animal's function.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.030
And here I'm going to create a variable.

06:49.150 --> 06:54.170
I'm going to call the scroll and I'm going to set it equal to and on here this is going to be again

06:54.470 --> 06:59.780
the other side window here and I'm selecting window and scroll up.

06:59.800 --> 07:04.640
So basically I'm saying what's the position at the point of scrolling right.

07:04.730 --> 07:08.710
See I'm getting a scroll of position in this back.

07:08.750 --> 07:11.970
Now I would want to have a conditional statement.

07:12.010 --> 07:19.300
This is going to say if we're here and I'm going to say scroll and the scroll is bigger or equal to

07:19.300 --> 07:22.230
70 70 pixels basically right.

07:22.350 --> 07:27.210
So in the moment as I'm scrolling down something should happen and the way I'm going to write over here.

07:27.230 --> 07:33.490
All right I'm going to say that again I'm going to select all here this time than have a right to see

07:33.490 --> 07:36.900
or hear him on the second half and I'm going to add the class of new.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.460
Now.

07:37.490 --> 07:44.650
The class that we just created and on here I'm just going to say at class here and I'm going to say

07:44.740 --> 07:48.900
you know you new here on here.

07:48.940 --> 07:52.390
Then the moment I scroll back I actually want to take away that class.

07:52.390 --> 07:52.930
All right.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.420
So if statement and then I will have.

07:55.410 --> 08:02.200
Else we're going to pull some are calling here or here I'm going to say else and we're going to say

08:02.200 --> 08:03.840
that same thing.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.960
Just wanted to remove this class.

08:06.260 --> 08:12.680
So I'm going to copy and paste this like this and I'm going to say removed because not that class or

08:12.830 --> 08:19.710
the class so I'm going to say remove class really this and maybe let's delete this class.

08:19.720 --> 08:25.620
So again I'm going to say this right now we can go back over here and we can just refresh right.

08:25.810 --> 08:31.600
And the moment you can see that as I scroll down to more than 70 or here like this and you can see that

08:31.600 --> 08:37.190
right now my bar right away is actually popping up right.

08:37.330 --> 08:41.390
And not only it's popping out but I can see that as I'm scrolling it actually stays right.

08:41.440 --> 08:42.490
So what we do though.

08:42.570 --> 08:43.140
Right.

08:43.390 --> 08:47.730
So let's go back to Mencius it's like you can see or hear this was our javascript right.

08:47.760 --> 08:54.580
So this basically we just said that we would want to had this class only on condition I was calling.

08:54.660 --> 08:58.660
But let's look at what actually we added in this class right now.

08:58.980 --> 09:00.860
So we said position fixed.

09:00.890 --> 09:01.420
Right.

09:01.420 --> 09:07.820
So this was basically what it said was all here that we would want it in a fixed position.

09:07.820 --> 09:11.900
All right so I'm going here I'm going to come in these ones out we can say this right.

09:11.920 --> 09:17.740
Basically what I'm saying is that as I'm starting to scroll on here I would want to in a fixed position

09:17.740 --> 09:19.360
right so it always does.

09:19.360 --> 09:26.150
Now what do we need to do is we would need to have the width for this exposition to be 100 view with.

09:26.350 --> 09:29.170
That's why we have a with 100 units.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.410
So it's uncommon.

09:30.470 --> 09:31.900
Right let's say this.

09:32.050 --> 09:35.490
And the last thing that I would want to do here why I have the xenix.

09:35.560 --> 09:36.070
All right.

09:36.070 --> 09:38.230
So let's start starting to scroll right.

09:38.350 --> 09:41.120
And you can see that I'm actually going behind that right.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.790
You can see especially this one right.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.260
It totally disappears.

09:44.440 --> 09:47.620
So therefore we're using the z index right.

09:47.740 --> 09:53.590
Basically get then have to actually be on top of the elements right.

09:53.590 --> 09:55.180
Not going on the right.

09:55.270 --> 10:01.320
So you can see on the right now as I'm going I need to go over here that I have this little issue where

10:01.320 --> 10:06.170
let's say if you want one I remember how we got rid of the icons actually in the beginning.

10:06.170 --> 10:06.680
Right.

10:06.690 --> 10:12.510
So let's say if we wouldn't want these icons over here now what we would need to do is since we selected

10:12.510 --> 10:19.260
over here last of type here like this with this tree right now what we would need to do is I'm going

10:19.260 --> 10:25.900
to copy this and we're going to go back over here and Rivara we have a display nonne or here for nav

10:25.910 --> 10:26.580
icons.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.400
We're actually going to override this.

10:28.420 --> 10:32.910
All right so we're going to say we're here we're going to do this and we're going to copy this one right.

10:33.060 --> 10:37.470
So we're going to have a map you high on here.

10:37.510 --> 10:38.090
You know what.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.770
It was the wrong one.

10:39.780 --> 10:43.070
My apologies we need oh here last of type.

10:43.090 --> 10:44.440
These guys what we need.

10:44.550 --> 10:47.790
So I'm going to say on here last of type and that's going to be a display of.

10:48.030 --> 10:49.500
If you don't want the icons.

10:49.490 --> 10:50.400
All right.

10:50.400 --> 10:54.210
So again we had a display name for the Taliban.

10:54.210 --> 10:55.780
Now we have for last of.

10:55.970 --> 10:57.370
So I'm going to say this.

10:57.380 --> 10:58.740
And now we are fresh.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.840
Now I can see that the icons are gone.

11:01.050 --> 11:04.500
So if you don't want the icons right this is the way to go.

11:04.710 --> 11:09.440
Now another thing that I would want to do is actually you can see that as I'm pressing them right.

11:09.630 --> 11:13.580
Actually we can obviously get the links to the certain section right.

11:13.590 --> 11:21.510
And the way we do that would go here for the index and for the ATRA Obviously instead of a having a

11:21.510 --> 11:26.630
dummy link like this right just with the hash tag what we can do is we can obviously have the idea what's

11:26.650 --> 11:28.330
going to be the name of the section.

11:28.410 --> 11:32.990
And honestly again I keep repeating we already created these sections and later videos.

11:33.070 --> 11:36.810
And I said don't worry about them we're going to be going over them and you will see where I'm getting

11:36.810 --> 11:37.890
these ideas.

11:37.890 --> 11:44.670
All right so the basic idea is it doesn't matter what kind of ID you give it for your section when because

11:44.670 --> 11:46.980
later on you can see icons section.

11:47.010 --> 11:50.070
Is going to be a section you can see how we're going to be doing.

11:50.120 --> 11:50.530
All right.

11:50.640 --> 11:57.810
So as we're going to be adding up the IDs right we can actually add these ideas to the ATRA.

11:57.810 --> 11:58.320
Right.

11:58.350 --> 12:02.980
So basically where this link is going to go right so this is going to go to the banner.

12:02.970 --> 12:05.470
This is going to go to skills and this is going to go for.

12:05.940 --> 12:09.990
And for now what you see is if I press to link.

12:10.040 --> 12:10.320
All right.

12:10.350 --> 12:13.520
It actually jumps or your services portfolio right.

12:13.680 --> 12:14.940
It keeps jumping.

12:14.940 --> 12:20.850
Now what I would want to do is actually have a smooth scroll and the way we do that with the jack wiring.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.520
All right so going to check it out.

12:22.520 --> 12:28.380
So this is going to be the end of this on your statement and rule and on here we're going to write that

12:28.380 --> 12:36.000
this is going to be a dollar sign and we are going to say have a and will say click on it so as we're

12:36.000 --> 12:42.390
clicking the links on nav right now we're going to we're going to write a function and again this is

12:42.390 --> 12:46.060
going to be a unanimous function or here I'm just going to write.

12:46.080 --> 12:51.270
Let's say that this is going to be I don't know any kind of any kind of whatever parameter you would

12:51.270 --> 12:51.620
want.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.220
Right.

12:52.260 --> 12:55.350
So I would say oh here I'm going to write a link like this.

12:55.350 --> 12:56.010
Right.

12:56.010 --> 13:01.110
And the way I'm going to write it that this is going to be a link and first that I would want is prevent

13:01.110 --> 13:02.240
default.

13:02.240 --> 13:06.420
And so basically I wanted to go to you are all on this.

13:06.600 --> 13:12.930
Once we have a prevent default then or here this is going to be let's say that this is going to be another

13:13.320 --> 13:14.580
variable that I'm creating.

13:14.650 --> 13:16.170
So say I'm going to say Target.

13:16.300 --> 13:16.830
Right.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.410
So this is where I would want to go.

13:18.660 --> 13:27.010
I know here since I'm selecting multiple links and Jake where is returning or hear me a list of them

13:27.010 --> 13:34.980
mine I can select each one by actually using this right here I'm going to say attribute right or here

13:34.980 --> 13:38.460
I'm just going to say if I'm reading this right.

13:38.460 --> 13:43.640
So basically what I'm saying is I'm getting back the actual atra.

13:43.910 --> 13:47.300
So this is going to be this attribute of a tree.

13:47.700 --> 13:52.060
And once we have this well here and the next thing that I'm going to say is this is going to be Dollar

13:52.060 --> 13:58.910
Sign this is going to be a HMO and the body both of them for the amount of money.

13:59.070 --> 14:06.550
And I'm just going to add a animate animate here and we're all going to have a parentheses here we're

14:06.590 --> 14:15.290
going to have an object and I'm really going to have a property of scroll top scroll here top doing

14:15.290 --> 14:17.690
this and then we're going to say we're here like this.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.390
Right.

14:18.410 --> 14:27.380
So for the target this woman is a target and we're going to place or hear this variable same one target

14:27.830 --> 14:33.550
and we're going to say offset or here and then we're going to say top top over here.

14:33.590 --> 14:34.120
Right.

14:34.130 --> 14:44.000
So basically what we're saying is that once we actually press them to have the h the now and the body

14:44.780 --> 14:53.130
should be in the position wherever you're here for the target it is offset So basically where our link

14:53.130 --> 14:53.840
is going to be.

14:53.850 --> 14:54.350
Right.

14:54.570 --> 14:59.460
And here that's where the position of the age the middle and the body should be all here.

14:59.700 --> 15:06.210
And then once we have this actually what we need here is we just need to add the how long this can take.

15:06.210 --> 15:06.510
Right.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.880
And I'm just going right on here slow healing.

15:08.940 --> 15:09.360
That's right.

15:09.360 --> 15:15.450
And again we can have values of milliseconds right the way we were using or here we can just also write

15:15.690 --> 15:17.250
fast and slow.

15:17.490 --> 15:22.050
And since I like my animations to be slowed just so you can actually see what's happening I'm going

15:22.050 --> 15:25.730
to write it with slow right hand was going to say it over here.

15:25.800 --> 15:31.230
And what we need to remember that this could be named anything because this is parameter and the same

15:31.230 --> 15:34.740
or here this variable can also be name whatever you'd want.

15:34.740 --> 15:35.320
All right.

15:35.460 --> 15:38.810
So I'm just going to say this and we're going to go back over here.

15:38.860 --> 15:44.400
We're going to refresh now and see what happens as I click on here now it moved to the manor then as

15:44.400 --> 15:50.970
I click on here we actually move to services then portfolio then back to services and then to home.

15:51.020 --> 15:56.610
Right and try actually looking at it first by adding these things again.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.120
Maybe don't do it right now.

15:58.270 --> 16:01.540
Let's actually follow me with building the next sections.

16:01.540 --> 16:01.860
All right.

16:01.870 --> 16:07.370
But as you do and actually check it out how it works without adding this line of script.

16:07.370 --> 16:07.700
All right.

16:07.740 --> 16:10.470
And obviously you can get this in the source files.

16:10.650 --> 16:14.840
Hundreds of videos right that you can actually download this if you don't want to write in yourself.

16:15.150 --> 16:20.140
But over here what's happening is right that we can have this target right.

16:20.430 --> 16:25.970
And this is just a Jake the code for actually small strokes.

16:26.090 --> 16:31.290
And now that we're done with that bar we can move on to here to our banner.
