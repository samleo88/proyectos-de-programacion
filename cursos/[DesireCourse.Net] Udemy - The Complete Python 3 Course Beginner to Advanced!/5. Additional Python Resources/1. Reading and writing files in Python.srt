00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:07,649
Hey guys, welcome back. We have a few more things to do before we get into GUI

2

00:00:07,649  -->  00:00:11,519
programming, but that is what we're going
to do next.

3

00:00:11,519  -->  00:00:18,420
I was going to do pygtk built-in GUI
library, and then also pycute, but I'm

4

00:00:18,420  -->  00:00:22,470
not going to do pygtk because it looks
like since the last time I used it

5

00:00:22,980  -->  00:00:26,910
it's actually been obsoleted and
discontinued. So we're just going to go

6

00:00:26,910  -->  00:00:32,520
through I think just pycute for now, I
mean that seems pretty full,

7

00:00:33,030  -->  00:00:37,140
so we'll do that. But, first we need to
discuss is a few more concepts before we

8

00:00:37,140  -->  00:00:39,809
actually get into that and so the first
one that we're going to be talking about

9

00:00:39,809  -->  00:00:45,059
is a form of data persistence, and what I
mean by that is we want the ability to

10

00:00:45,059  -->  00:00:51,780
open and read and write files in Python,
and that's something that we have native

11

00:00:51,780  -->  00:00:56,489
support in the Python language without
even importing anything. So we're going

12

00:00:56,489  -->  00:01:00,480
to look at a few examples, the first one
we're going to do is just a basic

13

00:01:00,480  -->  00:01:07,860
writing a txt file, and so let's go ahead
and start that. So basically what we need

14

00:01:07,860  -->  00:01:13,500
to do is we need to create a variable
that stores the file in the buffer and

15

00:01:13,500  -->  00:01:17,759
then we write to that file. So what we're
going to do is we're going to create a

16

00:01:17,759  -->  00:01:26,070
variable called, oops I just took a
screenshot, "newfile = open" and then

17

00:01:26,070  -->  00:01:30,990
this is gonna take two parameters. So the
first parameter is going to be the name

18

00:01:30,990  -->  00:01:36,299
of the file that we want to create, now
you can add an absolute path in here

19

00:01:36,299  -->  00:01:43,170
by using the I believe it's OS join and
you can join file paths and stuff, but

20

00:01:43,170  -->  00:01:45,930
we're going to do we're just going to
create a final in the current directory,

21

00:01:45,930  -->  00:01:54,360
and we're going to call it "("newfile.txt")" and then you put a comma and

22

00:01:54,360  -->  00:01:58,619
then the second parameter it takes is
what type of operations it's going to be

23

00:01:58,619  -->  00:02:03,149
doing on the file. So if we just want it
to read a file we would add the r flag,

24

00:02:03,149  -->  00:02:07,979
but what we're going to do is we're
going to write to the file so let's add

25

00:02:07,979  -->  00:02:13,620
"w+" So then
that's going to create a file

26

00:02:13,620  -->  00:02:18,299
in the system's memory, and then we can
manipulate that file and save it. So what

27

00:02:18,299  -->  00:02:21,510
we're going to do is we're going to create
another variable which is going to just

28

00:02:21,510  -->  00:02:33,239
be a string of texts, so label this a
"string = "This is the content that will be

29

00:02:33,239  -->  00:02:41,519
written to the text file." and then how we
write it is we're going to use the

30

00:02:41,519  -->  00:02:50,129
new file as a sort of object, so we're
gonna type "newfile.write" and then

31

00:02:50,129  -->  00:02:53,609
we're just going to pass it what we want
to write to the file. So in this case

32

00:02:53,609  -->  00:03:02,280
it's just going to be the "(string)" Now if
we save this, and we go to run it, we have

33

00:03:02,280  -->  00:03:05,609
no output, but you'll see that it did
create the new text file and if i open

34

00:03:05,609  -->  00:03:06,390
it,

35

00:03:06,390  -->  00:03:11,940
it has the content that we wanted to
be into it. So that's basically how you

36

00:03:11,940  -->  00:03:16,560
can write to a file, now let's say we
want to read from a file. We're going to

37

00:03:16,560  -->  00:03:20,340
do that in the next video and we're
going to also be going over some JSON

38

00:03:20,340  -->  00:03:21,480
stuff as well.
