00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:05,220
Alright guys, what we're going to do
before we get into the role playing game

2

00:00:05,220  -->  00:00:13,889
battle script program is we're going to
learn how to import modules that we define

3

00:00:13,889  -->  00:00:18,960
ourselves from relative paths. So what I
mean by that is this is just to keep

4

00:00:18,960  -->  00:00:24,660
your code readable, you shouldn't define
classes inside of your main file,

5

00:00:24,660  -->  00:00:29,340
that does get pretty messy and it makes
it hard to read through it, where if you

6

00:00:29,340  -->  00:00:33,059
have like if you break it up into
multiple files it's going to make it a

7

00:00:33,059  -->  00:00:39,329
lot easier. So what we're going to do is
we are going to create a class. So we're

8

00:00:39,329  -->  00:00:41,879
going to go ahead and create a new
directory,

9

00:00:41,879  -->  00:00:47,340
we're going to call it classes, and then
inside this classes directory what we

10

00:00:47,340  -->  00:00:52,230
need to do to be able to import classes
from this directory, we need to add an

11

00:00:52,230  -->  00:00:57,329
empty file with the name

12

00:00:57,329  -->  00:01:04,680
"__init__"  So just like
the class method for the init

13

00:01:04,680  -->  00:01:09,210
function this is just going to be an
empty file so we just create it. Now in the

14

00:01:09,210  -->  00:01:13,619
classes directory we can start to create
our class, so what we're going to do is

15

00:01:13,619  -->  00:01:17,880
create a file called "enemy" and then in
this file

16

00:01:17,880  -->  00:01:29,490
we're going to just define "class Enemy:"
and "def __init__(self, hp, mp):"

17

00:01:29,490  -->  00:01:37,170
What we're going to do is we're going to set "self.max_hp = hp"

18

00:01:37,170  -->  00:01:46,229
and "self.hp = hp" and "self.max_mp = mp" "self.mp = mp"

19

00:01:50,210  -->  00:01:59,900
and if any of you are not role-playing
game fans this is just the HP is your

20

00:01:59,900  -->  00:02:05,690
health and the MP is your magic points, and magic spells cost magic points. So, we're

21

00:02:05,690  -->  00:02:12,260
just going to create one more function
in here the class method called "def get_hp(self):"

22

00:02:12,260  -->  00:02:22,010
and what this is going to do is just
going to "return self.hp" Let's go ahead

23

00:02:22,010  -->  00:02:26,930
and save this, let's go back to our
attack script. So, before we can start

24

00:02:26,930  -->  00:02:31,670
using that enemy class within our script
we need to import it. So how we do that

25

00:02:31,670  -->  00:02:35,450
we need to first tell python that it's a
relative import, so we're going to say

26

00:02:35,450  -->  00:02:45,290
"from classes.enemy import Enemy" To break this down a bit

27

00:02:45,290  -->  00:02:53,269
you might think well he should'nt that be a slash? No, that's not how imports work with Python.

28

00:02:53,269  -->  00:03:02,150
So what we do is instead of putting "/"
there as a relative path you put a "." and

29

00:03:02,150  -->  00:03:09,680
then from here we're just going to
instantiate the "enemy = Enemy(200, 60)"

30

00:03:09,680  -->  00:03:15,110
"enemy = Enemy(200, 60)" and then just to confirm that we've got

31

00:03:15,110  -->  00:03:21,950
that imported correctly we're going to
"print(enemy.get_hp())" and save this and run

32

00:03:21,950  -->  00:03:30,320
the file, and we see 200. So, I'm actually
going to just put ""HP:" make it a little

33

00:03:30,320  -->  00:03:41,239
cleaner, save it, run it again, there we go. So, that shows the current HP of the enemy.
