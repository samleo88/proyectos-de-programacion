1

00:00:01,220  -->  00:00:03,800
Ok, so, what we're going to do now is make

2

00:00:03,800  -->  00:00:08,900
our elixirs and attack items work. So,

3

00:00:08,900  -->  00:00:11,240
it's really simple just down here what

4

00:00:11,240  -->  00:00:16,250
we're going to do is elif item.type

5

00:00:16,250  -->  00:00:21,019
== "elixir" and remember we have a,

6

00:00:21,019  -->  00:00:23,599
we're gonna need to also target the elixir

7

00:00:23,599  -->  00:00:28,489
by name because mega elixir makes, well it

8

00:00:28,489  -->  00:00:30,679
heals the entire party, and we've only got

9

00:00:30,679  -->  00:00:33,079
one party member right now anyway so it

10

00:00:33,079  -->  00:00:35,150
doesn't really matter. We will come back

11

00:00:35,150  -->  00:00:36,830
to this in the next video, I think we're

12

00:00:36,830  -->  00:00:40,040
going to add multiple party members. So, for

13

00:00:40,040  -->  00:00:44,510
right now just player.hp =

14

00:00:44,510  -->  00:00:50,540
player.maxhp, and player.mp =

15

00:00:50,540  -->  00:01:00,329
player.maxmp.

16

00:01:00,329  -->  00:01:05,489
Then what we need to do is print out what

17

00:01:05,489  -->  00:01:06,000
happened.

18

00:01:06,000  -->  00:01:22,799
So, bcolors.OKGREEN..."fully restores HP/MP"

19

00:01:22,799  -->  00:01:36,990
And then bcolors.ENDC. elif

20

00:01:36,990  -->  00:01:43,440
item.type == "attack": we say enemy.take_damage

21

00:01:43,440  -->  00:01:45,509
the damage they're going to

22

00:01:45,509  -->  00:01:46,020
take is

23

00:01:46,020  -->  00:01:51,450
(item.prop), so whatever value it has.

24

00:01:51,450  -->  00:01:55,649
So, for instance, if we use this it's going to say

25

00:01:55,649  -->  00:02:01,319
okay we will do 500 damage to the enemy. I'm

26

00:02:01,319  -->  00:02:18,430
going to print out, I think attack is red,

27

00:02:18,430  -->  00:02:26,910
ah keyboard...

28

00:02:26,910  -->  00:02:31,830
So, I'm going to say item.name deals item.prop,

29

00:02:31,830  -->  00:02:48,069
"points of damage"

30

00:02:48,069  -->  00:02:50,140
Alright, so to see this in action what we need

31

00:02:50,140  -->  00:02:52,090
to do is

32

00:02:52,090  -->  00:02:55,269
let's start off using magic,

33

00:02:55,269  -->  00:02:58,239
so we're lowering our hip points and

34

00:02:58,239  -->  00:03:00,099
magic points are lowering, so let's do that

35

00:03:00,099  -->  00:03:00,849
one again.

36

00:03:00,849  -->  00:03:07,239
Meteor and then one more, we've got 5 magic

37

00:03:07,239  -->  00:03:08,950
points and we can't do much with that. Let's go

38

00:03:08,950  -->  00:03:10,780
ahead and use item and the item we're going

39

00:03:10,780  -->  00:03:14,650
to use is elixir. So, yourself 4, hit enter, as

40

00:03:14,650  -->  00:03:16,299
you can see our hit points and magic

41

00:03:16,299  -->  00:03:19,150
points restored entirely, so we know

42

00:03:19,150  -->  00:03:20,260
that's working. The one thing that

43

00:03:20,260  -->  00:03:22,120
doesn't work right now is the quantity.

44

00:03:22,120  -->  00:03:25,150
I'm still trying to decide a way to do that, I

45

00:03:25,150  -->  00:03:28,719
think what we're going to do is in here

46

00:03:28,719  -->  00:03:30,790
where we create the list

47

00:03:30,790  -->  00:03:33,489
we're going to set spell and then quantity in

48

00:03:33,489  -->  00:03:35,709
here so that different players can have

49

00:03:35,709  -->  00:03:41,049
different well item quantities. So, let's go

50

00:03:41,049  -->  00:03:42,609
ahead and end this, we're going to end this

51

00:03:42,609  -->  00:03:43,750
video here, and we're going to be doing

52

00:03:43,750  -->  00:03:46,299
that in the, actually let's do that right

53

00:03:46,299  -->  00:03:55,689
now as well. Item is going to be potion, and

54

00:03:55,689  -->  00:04:02,620
quantity is going to be 5 so we will have 5 of those.

55

00:04:02,620  -->  00:04:16,209
Now I'm going to copy this...

56

00:04:16,209  -->  00:04:21,519
alright, cool.

57

00:04:21,519  -->  00:04:24,940
So, "item":

58

00:04:24,940  -->  00:04:35,650
hipotion, "quantity": let's say we have 5 of those. Let's

59

00:04:35,650  -->  00:04:45,460
say we have 15 regular potions. Let's skip down another line

60

00:04:45,460  -->  00:04:58,630
here, actually superpotion.

61

00:04:58,630  -->  00:05:03,460
Superpotion we've

62

00:05:03,460  -->  00:05:11,560
got 5, "item": here is going to be

63

00:05:11,560  -->  00:05:15,430
elixir. We are going to need to change some

64

00:05:15,430  -->  00:05:21,040
things within our script for this in order to work.

65

00:05:21,040  -->  00:05:34,090
"item": hielixer, "quantity": 5 and then "item":

66

00:05:34,090  -->  00:05:40,360
grenade. So, hielixer we'll have 2

67

00:05:40,360  -->  00:05:42,790
of those, there we go.

68

00:05:42,790  -->  00:05:44,650
So, what's gonna happen now when we try

69

00:05:44,650  -->  00:05:47,770
and run our script and choose an item, if we

70

00:05:47,770  -->  00:05:51,070
try to list the item it's going to fail. What

71

00:05:51,070  -->  00:05:55,240
we need to do is get is in here when we're

72

00:05:55,240  -->  00:06:02,170
listing the items...item so this is going to be

73

00:06:02,170  -->  00:06:04,750
item.item.name,

74

00:06:04,750  -->  00:06:15,889
item.item.description, and then here

75

00:06:15,889  -->  00:06:22,069
I'm going to say str(item.quantity).

76

00:06:22,069  -->  00:06:27,560
Let's go ahead and save, 'dict; object has no attribute 'item'

77

00:06:27,560  -->  00:06:34,490
Let's go ahead and find out what,

78

00:06:34,490  -->  00:06:53,289
so player_items is set to list,

79

00:06:53,289  -->  00:06:56,830
I am not sure if that's what's wrong but let me

80

00:06:56,830  -->  00:07:09,289
try.

81

00:07:09,289  -->  00:07:16,990
Yep, alright, so that's what it is.

82

00:07:16,990  -->  00:07:22,330
Again it's just be accessing variables and

83

00:07:22,330  -->  00:07:26,650
values in the wrong way. So, as you can see

84

00:07:26,650  -->  00:07:28,630
we've now got actually individual

85

00:07:28,630  -->  00:07:30,100
quantities,

86

00:07:30,100  -->  00:07:33,970
the only problem here is that it's causing an error.

87

00:07:33,970  -->  00:07:39,550
So, let's restart that, and

88

00:07:39,550  -->  00:07:41,950
that looks a little better. So, what we're going

89

00:07:41,950  -->  00:07:43,450
to need to do also is reduced the

90

00:07:43,450  -->  00:07:47,350
quantity of the item when we use one, so

91

00:07:47,350  -->  00:07:59,870
what we need to do

92

00:07:59,870  -->  00:08:02,570
in here is actually use the item as well so

93

00:08:02,570  -->  00:08:04,640
i'm going to attack a little bit,

94

00:08:04,640  -->  00:08:14,000
try and use a potion, no. So, player.items and

95

00:08:14,000  -->  00:08:22,760
then [item_choice]...let's try that.

96

00:08:22,760  -->  00:08:27,230
Alright, and then you put that after the end

97

00:08:27,230  -->  00:08:29,090
I was just getting mixed up a little with the

98

00:08:29,090  -->  00:08:33,110
order of how we built that object. There we go.

99

00:08:33,110  -->  00:08:35,570
So, now we're able to actually see this

100

00:08:35,570  -->  00:08:38,720
action, so let's go ahead and choose items.

101

00:08:38,720  -->  00:08:41,090
Let's go ahead and use and we've got 5, so next

102

00:08:41,090  -->  00:08:43,670
time around we need to reduce the number

103

00:08:43,670  -->  00:08:55,040
that it will allow us to use. So, let's

104

00:08:55,040  -->  00:08:55,850
set

105

00:08:55,850  -->  00:09:00,320
item_quantity =

106

00:09:00,320  -->  00:09:02,780
player.items

107

00:09:02,780  -->  00:09:07,910
[item_choice] and I'm going to target

108

00:09:07,910  -->  00:09:12,650
["quantity"], we're going to say item_quantity

109

00:09:12,650  -->  00:09:20,040
-= 1.

110

00:09:20,040  -->  00:09:23,190
There we go. So, this is going to handle now

111

00:09:23,190  -->  00:09:25,290
reducing the number of the items as well.

112

00:09:25,290  -->  00:09:27,990
So, 3 let's use that,

113

00:09:27,990  -->  00:09:30,180
let's go back here and we can see that it didn't actually work.

114

00:09:30,180  -->  00:09:54,970
So, let's print(item_quantity),

115

00:09:54,970  -->  00:09:57,430
Alright, so what we need to do is we actually

116

00:09:57,430  -->  00:10:08,370
need to set that directly.

117

00:10:08,370  -->  00:10:14,230
Let's try this again...

118

00:10:14,230  -->  00:10:19,150
potion and now you can see that this number is being reduced.

119

00:10:19,150  -->  00:10:20,440
So,

120

00:10:20,440  -->  00:10:23,050
what was happening before when I stored

121

00:10:23,050  -->  00:10:25,630
this value in another variable we

122

00:10:25,630  -->  00:10:27,610
modified the variable that we created,

123

00:10:27,610  -->  00:10:29,980
but we didn't actually modified this

124

00:10:29,980  -->  00:10:36,760
itself. So, what we need to do now if we

125

00:10:36,760  -->  00:10:42,460
use an item that we have two of, so that's 5, so let's

126

00:10:42,460  -->  00:10:48,220
use MegaElixer and we'll see that's 0, and then we go

127

00:10:48,220  -->  00:10:51,400
down into the negatives. So, what we do is

128

00:10:51,400  -->  00:10:54,880
we need to say if we have enough items, or

129

00:10:54,880  -->  00:11:02,080
rather if player.items

130

00:11:02,080  -->  00:11:12,850
[item_choice] ["quantity"] == 0:, we need to say

131

00:11:12,850  -->  00:11:13,840
bcolors.

132

00:11:13,840  -->  00:11:22,210
OKFAIL, skip a line, alright let's

133

00:11:22,210  -->  00:11:27,730
just say "None left..." and then lets say

134

00:11:27,730  -->  00:11:33,550
bcolors.EDNC, and let's continue from the top

135

00:11:33,550  -->  00:11:40,390
to allow us to choose again.

136

00:11:40,390  -->  00:11:44,800
Let's choose an item, let's say 5, so as you can see the MegaElixir

137

00:11:44,800  -->  00:11:55,710
dropped by 1...whoops...

138

00:11:55,710  -->  00:11:58,860
I need to put this before the

139

00:11:58,860  -->  00:12:03,690
reduction. Otherwise, when we have one left it

140

00:12:03,690  -->  00:12:05,970
would think we got 0 because it was after we

141

00:12:05,970  -->  00:12:08,910
reduced it, so it would be 0 after we

142

00:12:08,910  -->  00:12:13,200
actually use it,, but it would use it. So,

143

00:12:13,200  -->  00:12:15,690
we've got one left, and we've got 0,

144

00:12:15,690  -->  00:12:18,300
so let's try and use it again and it says none left.

145

00:12:18,300  -->  00:12:21,450
So, we choose again and that's exactly what we

146

00:12:21,450  -->  00:12:23,250
want, we want a way to be able to limit

147

00:12:23,250  -->  00:12:25,080
its kinda like checking the mp

148

00:12:25,080  -->  00:12:26,700
costs if you have enough magic points

149
