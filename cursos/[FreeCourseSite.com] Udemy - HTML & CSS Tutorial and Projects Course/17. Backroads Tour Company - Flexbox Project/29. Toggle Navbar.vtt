WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:05.620
And our next task is going to be setting up the functionality for toggling.

00:06.100 --> 00:11.770
So if we head over to a finished project you'll notice that on a smaller screen size I can see only

00:11.800 --> 00:16.710
the header and only once we click on a button then we can see the links.

00:16.760 --> 00:20.180
And then again if we click on a button we can hide the links.

00:20.190 --> 00:25.990
And this would be the case where first and foremost we're going to have to set up some C assessed weeks.

00:25.990 --> 00:32.770
So first of all let's head over to a style C assess and we're not going to work within the media query

00:33.250 --> 00:35.800
where we have nine hundred ninety two pixels.

00:35.800 --> 00:41.680
Instead we're going to work on the smaller screen size map and first of all what I would like to do

00:42.040 --> 00:48.580
is point out something where if I'm going to head over to my elements and then within the elements we're

00:48.580 --> 00:51.520
going to find our NAV links.

00:51.520 --> 00:55.440
We would like to get first of all the height of my nav links.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.590
So let's navigate navigate.

00:58.660 --> 01:00.250
Let's see now links.

01:00.280 --> 01:08.290
So let me scroll up here on my page and you're going to notice that if in fact we hover over it we can

01:08.290 --> 01:11.320
see that the width is four hundred nineteen.

01:11.470 --> 01:14.200
And with of course is changing.

01:14.200 --> 01:20.380
So if we're gonna make our screen size bigger or smaller with is going to change however what is not

01:20.380 --> 01:27.670
going to change is in fact the height and you can see that the height in fact is two hundred and seventy

01:27.670 --> 01:28.260
one.

01:28.270 --> 01:34.780
So again if we have over the links notice here on the top and I cannot in fact zoom in over there but

01:35.320 --> 01:39.740
you've probably noticed that the height is 271.

01:39.830 --> 01:45.640
And if you can see on my screen you for sure can see on yours where it again gives you the width and

01:45.640 --> 01:46.140
height.

01:46.330 --> 01:49.250
And we're interested in that height value.

01:49.300 --> 01:58.870
So what I would like to do right now is in fact just add a comment of height being to 71 I believe 43

01:59.650 --> 02:03.000
or something like that again let me double check now links.

02:03.010 --> 02:03.270
Yeah.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.670
271 43.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.540
That is the height that I'm interested.

02:07.540 --> 02:13.360
So first of all what I would like to do in my C assess is hide these links by default.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.130
So the moment when page loads.

02:15.130 --> 02:21.280
I would like to hide links just like I have in the finished project and the way we do that is first

02:21.280 --> 02:23.570
of all by targeting the links.

02:23.570 --> 02:30.850
Remember that was the class in fact or NAV links and let's just say now links and first of all we're

02:30.850 --> 02:34.010
going to say height is supposed to be zero.

02:34.030 --> 02:35.580
That's step number one.

02:35.590 --> 02:40.440
But even though we do that notice we still can technically see the links.

02:40.660 --> 02:45.930
And in order to fix that we're gonna have to add a overflow of here like so.

02:46.270 --> 02:47.860
So now the links are here.

02:48.100 --> 02:53.920
Then once we have set up this height of 0 on our flow here and we're gonna have to come up with the

02:53.920 --> 03:01.570
class that we're gonna be able to add dynamically just when we click on a button then this class is

03:01.570 --> 03:03.520
going to be applied for my legs.

03:03.640 --> 03:06.760
So I'm going to call this class show links.

03:06.790 --> 03:13.240
And again if you are using the javascript code that I'm providing I would suggest in fact using the

03:13.240 --> 03:14.550
same naming.

03:14.620 --> 03:15.340
Okay.

03:15.370 --> 03:20.880
And then this is the case where I'm going to setup height of whatever value we had over here.

03:20.920 --> 03:28.090
So my one was 271 point forty three pixels.

03:28.560 --> 03:34.380
And let me just show you right away manually how it's going to look like.

03:34.470 --> 03:41.880
So if we're going to head over back to the NAV links I'm just showing you how it's gonna work without

03:41.880 --> 03:48.330
javascript and let's say manually where we have the NAV links if we would head over there and add the

03:48.330 --> 03:51.930
class that we just created our links are gonna be shown.

03:51.930 --> 03:58.490
So if I'm going to type in show links you're going to notice that my links are in fact.

03:58.680 --> 04:03.830
Now if I'm going remove this class well the links are going to be hidden.

04:03.930 --> 04:05.900
So that is going to be our success.

04:05.910 --> 04:11.190
Now one last thing that I would like to add is in fact transition because I would like this change to

04:11.190 --> 04:17.880
happen over time not instantly because as you see in the final project we have this nice smooth effect

04:18.360 --> 04:20.700
not just toggling in between now.

04:21.150 --> 04:29.430
So the way we do that is again where we have the now links let's just add our transition let's say transition

04:30.030 --> 04:36.720
and we have the variable for that main transition like so let's save that.

04:36.750 --> 04:43.970
And now again let's start out by just doing it manually where we had a class of show links and that

04:43.970 --> 04:44.880
said we have the links.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.700
Now it's not going to show right now.

04:46.710 --> 04:50.500
The nice smooth transition the worry it's going to show once we have the javascript.

04:50.670 --> 04:55.920
But again just to show you this is in fact what we're going to do with JavaScript we're in fact going

04:55.920 --> 04:58.800
to target this particular class.

04:58.800 --> 05:03.510
But in fact we're going to use the idea but it is the same element and does matter and we're just going

05:03.510 --> 05:11.210
to add this class dynamically using JavaScript not once we have our CSA setup.

05:11.310 --> 05:15.320
Why don't we head over to app J.S. now instead of elements.

05:15.390 --> 05:20.360
I'm going to focus on a console right now because I'm going to show you kind of a one of the neat ways

05:20.360 --> 05:26.670
how we can always check whether our logic is going to work meaning her logic can still fail but I'm

05:26.670 --> 05:31.620
going to show you the first step that usually lets people down.

05:31.840 --> 05:32.430
OK.

05:32.610 --> 05:36.660
Now within the app James why don't we first right now toggle.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.420
So let's set up the comment.

05:38.430 --> 05:41.830
Let's right now toggle and let's target two things.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.970
We're going to target our toggle button and remember the I.D. was nav toggle.

05:48.300 --> 05:53.910
And by the way I need to add here I found some reason I skipped on a hyphen and do need to have the

05:53.910 --> 05:54.300
hyphen.

05:54.300 --> 05:57.630
So the idea is nav hyphen toggle.

05:57.720 --> 05:58.720
That's number one.

05:58.830 --> 06:03.830
And then we're going to target the I.D. by the value of NAV links.

06:03.840 --> 06:04.490
OK.

06:04.560 --> 06:05.850
Both of these things.

06:05.850 --> 06:13.430
So again let's set up some variables nav between is going to be document document.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.970
Get element by I.D..

06:16.290 --> 06:21.380
And like I said we're going to target our NAV toggle toggle.

06:21.420 --> 06:22.810
That's number one.

06:22.940 --> 06:29.910
And I'm going to copy and paste that and in fact we're going to write here links lengths and in this

06:29.910 --> 06:37.150
case I am going to use the NAV links so let's right now link Sandy.

06:37.250 --> 06:42.980
Like I said I would like to right away show you that we can use our console log function just to check

06:42.980 --> 06:50.720
whether we are selecting correct elements because we can write all the logic in the world if our selectors

06:50.720 --> 06:54.620
here in this case are wrong or are pointing to a different element.

06:54.770 --> 07:01.110
While our logic is not gonna make any sense or at least is not going to work the way we intend to.

07:01.490 --> 07:07.280
So first of all let's look for her variable not button and then let's look for a link whether we are

07:07.280 --> 07:14.790
targeting the correct variables let's say that and you're going to notice that here I have the No.

07:15.050 --> 07:21.350
Now that is the perfect example of something not working so I am looking for the NAV toggle but it is

07:21.350 --> 07:22.300
not working.

07:22.400 --> 07:28.180
Now the reason why it's not working because I changed my idea to NAV toggle but I didn't say that.

07:28.220 --> 07:33.470
Now the moment I say that I do have the button so again that is the perfect example where you could

07:33.470 --> 07:37.790
have some kind of error or your logic is not going to make sense.

07:37.970 --> 07:45.320
If in fact you are not targeting the correct element now in my case I had pretty much an error because

07:45.320 --> 07:51.080
I was looking for the idea that doesn't exist because I didn't save my indexation email and that way

07:51.080 --> 07:56.090
again I could set up some kind of logic but nothing would have worked because in fact I wasn't targeting

07:56.090 --> 08:02.210
the element now correctly we're targeting two things we're targeting our button and Norris chose here

08:02.510 --> 08:08.060
our awesome button the toggle button and then we have the links so I know that OK.

08:08.150 --> 08:13.730
At least initially everything is working fine since we are selecting both of the elements.

08:13.730 --> 08:14.540
All right.

08:14.540 --> 08:21.800
Now last we would like to have a event listener so bad event listener.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.400
So we'd like to add event listener for the button.

08:24.620 --> 08:27.630
So each and every time we're gonna click the button.

08:27.650 --> 08:31.610
In fact we're gonna set up the functionality and the way it's going to work.

08:31.730 --> 08:39.410
Since we have right now our element in our variable so let's right now button then we have our method

08:39.410 --> 08:46.340
by the value of the event listener and then within the allowed event listener we have to pass two things.

08:46.430 --> 08:48.840
What kind of event we're going to listen to.

08:48.840 --> 08:54.610
And the second one the callback function one in fact that event takes place.

08:54.890 --> 08:57.830
So I'm going to use the arrow function here and I'm going to say all right.

08:57.860 --> 09:04.330
So once we click on this now button again we can always just start by console logging.

09:04.340 --> 09:11.950
Hey you click the button I'm not save that.

09:12.010 --> 09:16.650
And now every time we're gonna click the button notice and console.

09:16.660 --> 09:18.670
Gonna have Hey you click the button.

09:18.670 --> 09:19.510
Awesome.

09:19.510 --> 09:24.960
So we know that again one step further and everything is working.

09:25.090 --> 09:28.520
So the last thing is we just need to set up this class.

09:28.600 --> 09:33.670
Remember this class of show links that we wanted to add dynamically.

09:33.670 --> 09:36.560
So what I'm gonna do right now is I'm going to say you know what.

09:36.580 --> 09:42.590
I also selected the links and I have an option of using class list property.

09:42.760 --> 09:46.120
And on the clerks list I have the method of toggle.

09:46.120 --> 09:51.850
And here I just specifically need to say well which class I would like to toggle and the class name

09:51.850 --> 09:54.310
is show links.

09:54.370 --> 09:59.970
Remember that is the class that we added in our show says so let me save this.

09:59.980 --> 10:05.410
Now let me head over to a bigger browser window because I would just like to point out how we're gonna

10:05.440 --> 10:07.920
be toggling in fact that particular class.

10:08.410 --> 10:11.010
And you know what I'm gonna do it on a small screen size anyway.

10:11.020 --> 10:12.600
So I guess it doesn't matter.

10:12.640 --> 10:18.780
So now let me go back to a elements and now noticed something interesting about NAV links.

10:19.150 --> 10:22.840
You can see that I have this div with the NAV links.

10:22.840 --> 10:29.530
Now notice what happens once in fact we click on the button we have right now not only the now links

10:29.530 --> 10:32.420
class but we also have a show links.

10:32.580 --> 10:35.590
And that's the reason why my links are displayed.

10:35.590 --> 10:42.490
Now once we click on it again dynamically we removed this class so same thing like we did before when

10:42.490 --> 10:46.340
we manually added that show links to NAV links.

10:46.370 --> 10:48.610
Now we're just doing it using javascript.

10:48.610 --> 10:53.120
So once we click on it we add showings once we click one more time.

10:53.260 --> 11:00.430
We just hide Alex so successfully guys we have added our toggle functionality to our project.
