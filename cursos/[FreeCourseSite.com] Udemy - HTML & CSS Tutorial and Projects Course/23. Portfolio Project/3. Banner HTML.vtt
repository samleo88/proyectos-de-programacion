WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:07.260
Now that the set up has been completed Let's actually start creating our first section which is going

00:07.260 --> 00:09.660
to be more here in half an hour here.

00:09.660 --> 00:14.200
This would be the banner so I'm going to go to my actual text.

00:14.550 --> 00:20.010
We're going to get a read of these and it once and for some here we don't need them right now.

00:20.010 --> 00:26.150
And as you can see that as I'm going to be working the live preview is going to be shown here and once

00:26.140 --> 00:31.710
once are going to want to check something more here on the bigger screen what I'm going to do is I already

00:31.710 --> 00:35.210
opened up and non-browser my file.

00:35.490 --> 00:41.130
So going back to the actual text editor what we're going to say we're here to we would want to start

00:41.250 --> 00:42.680
working with the body.

00:42.990 --> 00:49.180
Now in the body the first thing we're going to create is going to be a happier moment with a glass of

00:49.180 --> 00:49.680
Hatter.

00:49.860 --> 00:51.450
So I'm going to say we're here after.

00:51.630 --> 00:52.940
And also right away.

00:53.130 --> 00:55.270
And the glass is also going to be.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.360
Now once in the header.

00:57.360 --> 01:02.460
Now let's create our first comment and we're going to say we're here first child and this is going to

01:02.460 --> 01:05.210
mean this is going to be our first fluxbox.

01:05.550 --> 01:11.730
And this is just going to help us with our first section to actually understand how we are manipulating

01:11.730 --> 01:13.320
with a flex box.

01:13.320 --> 01:18.260
Now for the first show we're going to say that this is going to be a half hour and you can see that

01:18.330 --> 01:23.130
actually I don't need the comments on here and just need to know them and so I'm going to say we're

01:23.130 --> 01:25.790
here now with a class of math.

01:25.890 --> 01:29.010
Now I'm not going to write anything right now any kind of links.

01:29.010 --> 01:33.230
I mean a lot going on now because I don't want to make it less confusing.

01:33.390 --> 01:39.840
So I'm going to leave now for now and we're going to actually work on the banner number before we write

01:39.840 --> 01:43.230
the banner we're going to write that this is going to be second child.

01:43.230 --> 01:49.800
And again what this means is that we're going to create this header as a flex box parent and all this

01:49.800 --> 01:51.600
is going to be our first child.

01:51.750 --> 01:55.020
And this is going to be our second chance now for the second job.

01:55.050 --> 02:01.380
We're going to say this is going to be a and you know what let's not let's actually say that this is

02:01.380 --> 02:02.600
going to be the section.

02:02.640 --> 02:07.610
So I would say this is going to be section with a class of banner.

02:07.620 --> 02:10.760
Now what I would want over here in this matter.

02:10.920 --> 02:13.330
Well first I would want a banner container.

02:13.500 --> 02:18.260
And basically what banner container is going to be is going to hold all this over here.

02:18.360 --> 02:21.720
So we're going to say we're here that this is going to be any comment.

02:21.720 --> 02:26.720
So we're going to call this banner Container container.

02:26.940 --> 02:30.540
And over here we're going to say that this is actually going to be a day of.

02:30.810 --> 02:34.380
And we're going to say this is going to be did with a glass of banner.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.740
And or here.

02:35.790 --> 02:42.210
This is going to be two lines here and we're going to say that this is going to be container so to under

02:42.270 --> 02:47.780
slash and then there's going to be doing now within the bannered container what we're going to have.

02:47.980 --> 02:52.720
But first we're going to have a heading one with again a class of banner.

02:52.830 --> 02:57.380
And again this is going to be two underscores and this is going to be tight.

02:57.540 --> 02:59.520
Now what kind of text we're going to say.

02:59.700 --> 03:05.670
Well you can see or hear that we have a I am clever techie so we're going to write on here that this

03:05.670 --> 03:11.100
is going to be a I am clever and we're going to call this techie now.

03:11.190 --> 03:16.320
Once you have all you are adding one then we're just going to press tab on here you can see that now

03:16.320 --> 03:17.540
we are heading.

03:18.090 --> 03:22.680
Now after that we would want a banner jobs.

03:22.710 --> 03:29.670
So if this was a banner title next one is going to be a heading one which is going to have a class of

03:29.670 --> 03:30.820
banner jobs.

03:30.890 --> 03:37.170
So on this one then we're going to have banner to underscores again and jobs.

03:37.220 --> 03:39.610
Now what we would want inside here.

03:39.740 --> 03:42.750
Well first we would want a developer here.

03:42.840 --> 03:48.450
This is going to be our text then we're going to have a plan now within the span we're going to place

03:48.540 --> 03:49.680
a phantasm.

03:49.830 --> 03:58.080
So this is going to be F S F A and we're going to call this angle or angle the ball and we're going

03:58.080 --> 04:00.030
to call this right on here.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.810
So I go double.

04:02.850 --> 04:03.620
Right.

04:03.660 --> 04:10.970
So once more here you can see that I say I am I am clever techie and this is going to be our phantasm.

04:10.980 --> 04:12.600
So I need to go back over here.

04:12.810 --> 04:17.980
I'm going to press control space I get back my moment press time.

04:18.030 --> 04:21.440
And sure enough now I can see that this is going to be my angle.

04:21.450 --> 04:27.680
Right now I'm told that we would want one more I can and two times more text.

04:27.780 --> 04:31.010
So we're really going to call this a designer here.

04:31.010 --> 04:36.550
Now we're going to have a designer and now again we're are going to want to copy this plan.

04:36.810 --> 04:41.310
So I'm just going to select this by an element that I'm going to go here.

04:41.460 --> 04:48.900
And after that the actual designer or we're all going to say that we would want a spine or here like

04:48.900 --> 04:49.530
this.

04:49.530 --> 04:51.420
So I'm going to copy and paste this.

04:51.420 --> 04:52.020
Now I can do it.

04:52.020 --> 04:54.000
I'm the developer here.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.650
This will be our first font awesome then would be designer.

04:57.780 --> 04:59.510
And next from.

05:00.010 --> 05:04.220
Last one is going to be photographer photo for here.

05:04.230 --> 05:08.370
So once we save it hopefully I spelled this correctly.

05:08.490 --> 05:15.720
And now we are actually done with our HCM now and we can just go head over here and say this is going

05:15.720 --> 05:16.960
to be the end of header.

05:17.190 --> 05:24.750
So we're going to be and of her here and now we can go to the main scene and actually start styling

05:24.840 --> 05:26.060
our first section.
