Now before we dive in into exciting world of SEUS hasn't read.

00:04.770 --> 00:10.830
There are two important things we need to discuss browsers support and vendor prefixes.

00:10.830 --> 00:17.940
If you want to find out what is the current browser support for series as grid or any other services

00:17.970 --> 00:19.540
property for that matter.

00:19.590 --> 00:21.270
You can go to Web site.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.020
Can I use dot com.

00:23.160 --> 00:32.320
And very quickly find out that information and as you can see at the time of this recording browser

00:32.340 --> 00:38.970
support for UN prefixes as grid is seventy two point four percent.

00:39.390 --> 00:46.830
And once we have covered browser support let's talk about vendor prefixes when working with C S grid.

00:46.860 --> 00:54.180
We need to use vendor prefixes However in order not to make this material more confusing because we

00:54.180 --> 00:59.640
already have plenty to cover I won't be using vendor prefixes in this course.

00:59.640 --> 01:03.110
So during lectures we will be using a simple syntax.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.750
In this case this is going to be a display grid.

01:05.850 --> 01:12.970
But remember when working with CIRCE's grid in the real world we have to use vendor prefixes.

01:13.170 --> 01:17.910
Now that we have covered all the basics let's start learning CSSA great.
