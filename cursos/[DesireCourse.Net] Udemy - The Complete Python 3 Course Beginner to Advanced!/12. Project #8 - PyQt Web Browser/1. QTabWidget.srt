1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,330
Alright guys, so in the next video, or in

2

00:00:03,330  -->  00:00:04,589
this video I guess, what we're going to

3

00:00:04,589  -->  00:00:07,620
be doing is we're going to be building a

4

00:00:07,620  -->  00:00:09,480
web browser, and it's not going to be one

5

00:00:09,480  -->  00:00:11,160
video because there's a lot of stuff to

6

00:00:11,160  -->  00:00:13,920
cover, so it's probably going to be our

7

00:00:13,920  -->  00:00:15,839
second project. So what we need to do

8

00:00:15,839  -->  00:00:18,930
first off, we need to create a project. So,

9

00:00:18,930  -->  00:00:20,460
I'm going to go ahead and create a pure

10

00:00:20,460  -->  00:00:23,580
python project, and I'm going to call it

11

00:00:23,580  -->  00:00:28,170
web-browser. We're going to be

12

00:00:28,170  -->  00:00:34,009
using Python 3.5.2.1,

13

00:00:35,740  -->  00:00:44,410
and yeah. So I guess 3.5.3 is out. I

14

00:00:44,410  -->  00:00:48,310
haven't updated Python in a while, well since I

15

00:00:48,310  -->  00:00:51,660
started doing this course actually.

16

00:00:53,350  -->  00:00:56,859
Alright, so, once we've got our project

17

00:00:56,859  -->  00:00:58,750
created we obviously need to create a

18

00:00:58,750  -->  00:01:03,399
main file, so I'm just going to type main.py as

19

00:01:03,399  -->  00:01:06,460
always, and we're going to start with a

20

00:01:06,460  -->  00:01:09,759
few system level imports and what I

21

00:01:09,759  -->  00:01:12,310
mean by that is just so that you know so we can

22

00:01:12,310  -->  00:01:14,770
interact with the system like OS, sys, and stuff

23

00:01:14,770  -->  00:01:15,159
like that.

24

00:01:15,159  -->  00:01:20,080
So go ahead and write import sys, if that was spelled

25

00:01:20,080  -->  00:01:21,820
correctly that would import properly,

26

00:01:21,820  -->  00:01:29,770
import os. We are going to need json for

27

00:01:29,770  -->  00:01:34,750
later on so I am going to import that, and now we need to

28

00:01:34,750  -->  00:01:38,050
start importing our PyQt stuff. So,

29

00:01:38,050  -->  00:01:40,450
we're going to be adding to this import

30

00:01:40,450  -->  00:01:43,390
as we create new elements within our

31

00:01:43,390  -->  00:01:45,909
application, so for right now we're just

32

00:01:45,909  -->  00:01:50,170
going to do the bare minimum that we can

33

00:01:50,170  -->  00:01:55,030
actually do. So, from PyQt5.

34

00:01:55,030  -->  00:02:03,969
QtWidgets, so here we're going to

35

00:02:03,969  -->  00:02:06,340
open up brackets

36

00:02:06,340  -->  00:02:09,700
and we're going to start with

37

00:02:09,700  -->  00:02:18,819
QApplication, QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout,

38

00:02:18,819  -->  00:02:20,830
we're not using the grid at all

39

00:02:20,830  -->  00:02:32,769
here. We're going to say QPushButton, QLabel, we're

40

00:02:32,769  -->  00:02:36,849
going to need a QLineEdit for the

41

00:02:36,849  -->  00:02:41,440
address bar, QTabWidget, and in this

42

00:02:41,440  -->  00:02:42,640
video we're going to be talking a lot

43

00:02:42,640  -->  00:02:44,920
about tabs. So what you need to do is,

44

00:02:44,920  -->  00:02:46,540
actually we don't need TabWidget we

45

00:02:46,540  -->  00:02:51,579
need TabBar. And then what we're going

46

00:02:51,579  -->  00:02:56,140
to do, and I'll explain it more in depth

47

00:02:56,140  -->  00:03:00,819
as we go on, we are going to need QFrame,

48

00:03:00,819  -->  00:03:04,420
this is going to be our main window, we

49

00:03:04,420  -->  00:03:07,989
are going to need QStackedLayout, and I

50

00:03:07,989  -->  00:03:10,329
think this is all we need to really

51

00:03:10,329  -->  00:03:14,290
discuss right now. So, basically, with the

52

00:03:14,290  -->  00:03:17,709
QVBoxLayout QHBoxLayout both of

53

00:03:17,709  -->  00:03:19,989
those have all of their contents visible

54

00:03:19,989  -->  00:03:22,780
at the same time, but the QStackedLayout

55

00:03:22,780  -->  00:03:26,470
offers the ability to show a

56

00:03:26,470  -->  00:03:29,799
certain widget that is in it as the main

57

00:03:29,799  -->  00:03:32,170
widget, so you can switch back and forth. So,

58

00:03:32,170  -->  00:03:34,750
we're not going to be using a tab widget

59

00:03:34,750  -->  00:03:38,859
which includes both the tab bar and you

60

00:03:38,859  -->  00:03:42,400
know each individual tabs content that

61

00:03:42,400  -->  00:03:44,200
you can show when you click on a tab,

62

00:03:44,200  -->  00:03:46,989
we're going to be using the QTabBar

63

00:03:46,989  -->  00:03:50,049
specifically because we're going to

64

00:03:50,049  -->  00:03:52,989
have our tab bar on the top, and then our

65

00:03:52,989  -->  00:03:56,349
address bar, and then the tabs content. So

66

00:03:56,349  -->  00:03:58,450
we need those two disconnected in this

67

00:03:58,450  -->  00:04:01,870
way in order for this to work. Now we're

68

00:04:01,870  -->  00:04:06,760
going to say from PyQt5.QtGui

69

00:04:06,760  -->  00:04:10,510
import QIcon, we are going to be using

70

00:04:10,510  -->  00:04:15,750
these, QWindow,

71

00:04:16,579  -->  00:04:19,250
and I think that's all we need but I'm

72

00:04:19,250  -->  00:04:21,349
going to go ahead and write QImage just

73

00:04:21,349  -->  00:04:23,810
case because we might end up

74

00:04:23,810  -->  00:04:27,319
using up using that. And from

75

00:04:27,319  -->  00:04:35,449
PyQt5.QtCore import all, and I

76

00:04:35,449  -->  00:04:39,050
think that's going to be good for right

77

00:04:39,050  -->  00:04:40,639
now to actually get the tabs created and

78

00:04:40,639  -->  00:04:42,830
whatnot. So what we're going to do is

79

00:04:42,830  -->  00:04:45,050
let's go ahead create our main

80

00:04:45,050  -->  00:04:49,669
application, so class App, and it's going to

81

00:04:49,669  -->  00:04:52,219
inherit from QFrame and I'm going to

82

00:04:52,219  -->  00:04:56,270
explain why in a moment. What we need to

83

00:04:56,270  -->  00:05:00,740
do is we need to first initialize, and

84

00:05:00,740  -->  00:05:02,419
we need to initialize the parent as

85

00:05:02,419  -->  00:05:10,610
well, and then we're going to a set the

86

00:05:10,610  -->  00:05:15,199
window title first so self.set...

87

00:05:15,199  -->  00:05:17,180
...

88

00:05:17,180  -->  00:05:21,250
aw.

89

00:05:25,449  -->  00:05:29,349
Reactivate there because PyCharm

90

00:05:29,349  -->  00:05:33,249
is open on my other computer there, so it

91

00:05:33,249  -->  00:05:41,559
doesn't let you operate the

92

00:05:41,559  -->  00:05:43,990
same license on multiple machines at the

93

00:05:43,990  -->  00:05:45,370
same time.

94

00:05:45,370  -->  00:05:50,020
Alright, so, what we're going to do is

95

00:05:50,020  -->  00:05:53,169
self.setWindowTitle and we're going

96

00:05:53,169  -->  00:05:55,839
to set it to "Web Browser" because that's

97

00:05:55,839  -->  00:05:58,509
what we are going to be building. We're

98

00:05:58,509  -->  00:06:00,789
going to set the base size because we

99

00:06:00,789  -->  00:06:02,800
want it to open a certain size so that

100

00:06:02,800  -->  00:06:06,189
it's not you know small, so self.set

101

00:06:06,189  -->  00:06:10,360
BaseSize, and we're going to set it to

102

00:06:10,360  -->  00:06:16,479
1366 x 768, and I'm doing that because I know

103

00:06:16,479  -->  00:06:20,199
that my my other machine like my old

104

00:06:20,199  -->  00:06:22,870
laptop had a resolution like this, no 16

105

00:06:22,870  -->  00:06:24,699
by 9, so this is the first 16 by 9

106

00:06:24,699  -->  00:06:26,710
resolution that pops up at the top of my

107

00:06:26,710  -->  00:06:32,229
head here. And then we're going to just

108

00:06:32,229  -->  00:06:36,699
basically get into it. So, we're going to

109

00:06:36,699  -->  00:06:39,699
drop down here and create our actual

110

00:06:39,699  -->  00:06:44,129
window, so CreateApp, and

111

00:06:48,870  -->  00:06:54,090
this is what we're going to actually do

112

00:06:54,090  -->  00:06:55,680
our stuff in. So we need to call it from

113

00:06:55,680  -->  00:06:57,930
the initialization function, so self.

114

00:06:57,930  -->  00:07:00,810
CreateApp, and then this is going to run

115

00:07:00,810  -->  00:07:02,790
down here. So what we're going to start

116

00:07:02,790  -->  00:07:05,820
off with is setting our main window

117

00:07:05,820  -->  00:07:09,030
layout. So, let's go ahead and write

118

00:07:09,030  -->  00:07:09,990
self.

119

00:07:09,990  -->  00:07:15,510
layout = QVBoxLayout.

120

00:07:15,510  -->  00:07:19,080
Simple enough. What we need to do now we

121

00:07:19,080  -->  00:07:22,230
need to create our tab bar, so let's go

122

00:07:22,230  -->  00:07:30,750
ahead and self.tabbar = QTabBar,

123

00:07:30,750  -->  00:07:36,000
and we can pass arguments into this

124

00:07:36,000  -->  00:07:38,820
to modify the way that the tab bar works,

125

00:07:38,820  -->  00:07:39,930
and we're going to discuss that after,

126

00:07:39,930  -->  00:07:44,070
but for right now this is fine. Now we

127

00:07:44,070  -->  00:07:48,840
need to add tabs. So let me, let's just

128

00:07:48,840  -->  00:07:53,790
add two tabs, I guess, so the tabs that

129

00:07:53,790  -->  00:07:56,070
we're going to add are, they're just

130

00:07:56,070  -->  00:07:59,940
going to have titles themselves. So, let's

131

00:07:59,940  -->  00:08:08,040
go ahead and self.tabbar.addTab, and

132

00:08:08,040  -->  00:08:12,450
it's going to say "Tab 1" and that's really

133

00:08:12,450  -->  00:08:15,600
all you have to do to add a tab to this

134

00:08:15,600  -->  00:08:19,170
type of tab bar. If we were using a

135

00:08:19,170  -->  00:08:22,620
tab widget you would also need to send into

136

00:08:22,620  -->  00:08:27,030
this ad tab method what widget the tab is

137

00:08:27,030  -->  00:08:29,670
going to be responsible for. We're not

138

00:08:29,670  -->  00:08:30,660
going to do that right now we're just

139

00:08:30,660  -->  00:08:32,610
adding the tabs themselves just so we can

140

00:08:32,610  -->  00:08:36,570
see them. Now we need to set the current

141

00:08:36,570  -->  00:08:39,510
index of the tab bar, so this is going to

142

00:08:39,510  -->  00:08:43,080
tell the tab bar which tab is active.

143

00:08:43,080  -->  00:08:45,420
So it doesn't initialize with an

144

00:08:45,420  -->  00:08:47,430
active tab, I don't think, so we're going to set it.

145

00:08:47,430  -->  00:08:52,140
So, self.tabbar.set

146

00:08:52,140  -->  00:08:55,560
CurentIndex, and the the index is

147

00:08:55,560  -->  00:08:59,610
basically which tab in the row

148

00:08:59,610  -->  00:09:00,300
of tabs

149

00:09:00,300  -->  00:09:05,070
by an integer. So this should be tab 0, this should be

150

00:09:05,070  -->  00:09:08,070
tab 1. So we're going to set it to the first

151

00:09:08,070  -->  00:09:12,870
tab there. Now what we're going to do is

152

00:09:12,870  -->  00:09:16,530
we're actually going to create our main,

153

00:09:16,530  -->  00:09:21,300
well we can just put the tab bar

154

00:09:21,300  -->  00:09:26,340
into a widget and then set the

155

00:09:26,340  -->  00:09:29,940
widget, or set the layout to the widget,

156

00:09:29,940  -->  00:09:35,460
so, yeah. What we're going to do is we've

157

00:09:35,460  -->  00:09:37,380
got the layout, it's a VBoxLayout, so

158

00:09:37,380  -->  00:09:39,840
we're going to add the tab bar to that,

159

00:09:39,840  -->  00:09:43,230
and then set the layout of this app

160

00:09:43,230  -->  00:09:45,480
to self.layout which is a

161

00:09:45,480  -->  00:09:46,680
QVBox.

162

00:09:46,680  -->  00:09:49,500
So let's go ahead and write self.layout.

163

00:09:49,500  -->  00:09:53,580
addWidget, we're going to add self.

164

00:09:53,580  -->  00:09:57,870
tabbar, and we're going to say self.

165

00:09:57,870  -->  00:10:01,590
setLayout, and we're going to set it to

166

00:10:01,590  -->  00:10:04,080
self.layout, so this is going to make

167

00:10:04,080  -->  00:10:10,020
everything work. Now what we can do is

168

00:10:10,020  -->  00:10:11,940
break out of here, and I believe we're

169

00:10:11,940  -->  00:10:19,770
all done there, and say if __name__ == "__main__": so

170

00:10:19,770  -->  00:10:22,110
we need to create am app, so app =

171

00:10:22,110  -->  00:10:27,660
QApplication, and we need to pass sys.argv in here,

172

00:10:27,660  -->  00:10:30,870
and then we're going to create a window

173

00:10:30,870  -->  00:10:35,340
from our app class here, and then we're

174

00:10:35,340  -->  00:10:36,300
going to say

175

00:10:36,300  -->  00:10:43,110
sys.exit when app.exec is done

176

00:10:43,110  -->  00:10:43,770
running.

177

00:10:43,770  -->  00:10:50,750
So, let's go ahead and run this...

178

00:10:53,370  -->  00:10:57,910
and I think I forgot to

179

00:10:57,910  -->  00:11:03,820
show something. So, let me type in here

180

00:11:03,820  -->  00:11:12,100
self.show. As you can see we've got our window,

181

00:11:12,100  -->  00:11:16,330
the base size doesn't appear to have

182

00:11:16,330  -->  00:11:20,290
worked, but we've got a window, it's got

183

00:11:20,290  -->  00:11:24,130
tabs, and that's exactly what we want. So,

184

00:11:24,130  -->  00:11:27,160
I'm going to comment something out, and

185

00:11:27,160  -->  00:11:29,080
I'm going to use a tab widget to show

186

00:11:29,080  -->  00:11:32,380
you guys what a tab widget is, and how it's

187

00:11:32,380  -->  00:11:33,040
different.

188

00:11:33,040  -->  00:11:34,210
We're not going to be using it, but it's good to know.

189

00:11:34,210  -->  00:11:39,370
So we need to include QTabWidget, and

190

00:11:39,370  -->  00:11:41,080
then I'm going to comment out this tab

191

00:11:41,080  -->  00:11:42,880
bar declaration, and i'm going to say

192

00:11:42,880  -->  00:11:51,370
self.tabbar = QTabWidget, and

193

00:11:51,370  -->  00:11:54,130
then when we're adding tabs here we need to

194

00:11:54,130  -->  00:11:59,530
actually send a widget as an argument

195

00:11:59,530  -->  00:12:01,690
as well. So if you'll notice here I'm

196

00:12:01,690  -->  00:12:06,400
going to say QPushButton, and the push

197

00:12:06,400  -->  00:12:09,220
button is going to say "Tab 1" and then the

198

00:12:09,220  -->  00:12:15,220
title is going to say "First Tab." I'm going to copy

199

00:12:15,220  -->  00:12:23,680
this, and make that say "Tab 2." So, we're

200

00:12:23,680  -->  00:12:25,870
gonna run this again and this is a tab

201

00:12:25,870  -->  00:12:28,000
widget, and what you'll notice is that

202

00:12:28,000  -->  00:12:30,820
when I use this it

203

00:12:30,820  -->  00:12:33,010
automatically connects the widget, so you

204

00:12:33,010  -->  00:12:36,040
could set the, when you add a tab set

205

00:12:36,040  -->  00:12:39,190
the widget that it gets as a full, you

206

00:12:39,190  -->  00:12:41,980
know, VBoxLayout, or a widget that

207

00:12:41,980  -->  00:12:44,080
has a VBoxLayout and then stuff everything in

208

00:12:44,080  -->  00:12:45,280
there, and then you could make actual

209

00:12:45,280  -->  00:12:48,340
interfaces within each tab. But, we're

210

00:12:48,340  -->  00:12:49,600
not going to do that specifically

211

00:12:49,600  -->  00:12:50,980
because we need the address bar right

212

00:12:50,980  -->  00:12:59,440
here. So, I'm gonna undo that, and this is

213

00:12:59,440  -->  00:13:03,850
what we want for right now. So, in the

214

00:13:03,850  -->  00:13:05,710
next video we're going to talk about I

215

00:13:05,710  -->  00:13:10,130
guess making our

216

00:13:10,130  -->  00:13:14,080
tabs a bit more dynamic.
