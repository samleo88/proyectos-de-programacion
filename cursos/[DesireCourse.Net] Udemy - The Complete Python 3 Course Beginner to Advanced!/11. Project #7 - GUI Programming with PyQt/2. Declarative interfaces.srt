1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,030
Alright guys, welcome back. In the last

2

00:00:03,030  -->  00:00:05,339
video we learned how to actually create

3

00:00:05,339  -->  00:00:09,090
a qt window and the basic application

4

00:00:09,090  -->  00:00:12,120
and you could follow that path and build

5

00:00:12,120  -->  00:00:16,379
programmatic interfaces in Python itself,

6

00:00:16,379  -->  00:00:20,670
however since pyqt5 QML has been a

7

00:00:20,670  -->  00:00:24,480
thing and what QML is it's I believe it

8

00:00:24,480  -->  00:00:27,300
stands for the qt markup language, and

9

00:00:27,300  -->  00:00:30,000
it's more declarative the way that it's

10

00:00:30,000  -->  00:00:31,859
written works more like a mix between

11

00:00:31,859  -->  00:00:36,660
javascript, and HTML, and CSS rather than

12

00:00:36,660  -->  00:00:38,820
you know python and so that's what we're

13

00:00:38,820  -->  00:00:40,590
going to be learning today. When you

14

00:00:40,590  -->  00:00:43,920
install pyqt5 you instantly get

15

00:00:43,920  -->  00:00:47,579
access to QML through qt quick

16

00:00:47,579  -->  00:00:49,980
it's called, it's a module installed in pyqt5.

17

00:00:49,980  -->  00:00:51,780
So, what we're going to do is we're going

18

00:00:51,780  -->  00:00:53,190
to create a new application, it's going to

19

00:00:53,190  -->  00:00:55,199
be again just a basic application, but

20

00:00:55,199  -->  00:00:57,360
we're going to do it in QML so you guys

21

00:00:57,360  -->  00:00:59,219
can kind of see how to do this, and then

22

00:00:59,219  -->  00:01:00,840
we're going to be following that path

23

00:01:00,840  -->  00:01:03,690
further to make some awesome applications.

24

00:01:03,690  -->  00:01:06,750
So, the first thing we need is obviously

25

00:01:06,750  -->  00:01:12,150
a crunchbang, so #!usr/bin/python3, and

26

00:01:12,150  -->  00:01:13,470
then we're going to import some things.

27

00:01:13,470  -->  00:01:18,540
So, we're going to import os, sys and

28

00:01:18,540  -->  00:01:23,490
then from PyQt5.QtCore import * we're

29

00:01:23,490  -->  00:01:26,549
going to import everything for right now.

30

00:01:26,549  -->  00:01:34,829
From PyQt5.QtGui import *

31

00:01:34,829  -->  00:01:41,009
import everything, and we may not end up

32

00:01:41,009  -->  00:01:44,369
using some of this but we're going to

33

00:01:44,369  -->  00:01:47,340
important anyway. You are going to also import

34

00:01:47,340  -->  00:01:52,270
from PyQt5.QtQuick import *

35

00:01:52,270  -->  00:01:58,270
Alright, now what we're going to be

36

00:01:58,270  -->  00:02:00,429
doing at this point is basically

37

00:02:00,429  -->  00:02:04,390
building a qml application, and so how

38

00:02:04,390  -->  00:02:10,479
we do that is in the

39

00:02:10,479  -->  00:02:18,220
if__name__  == "__main__": we're going to

40

00:02:18,220  -->  00:02:20,080
instantiate the application so we're

41

00:02:20,080  -->  00:02:21,610
going to create a variable called

42

00:02:21,610  -->  00:02:25,540
app =  QGuiApplication

43

00:02:25,540  -->  00:02:29,980
and we're going to pass in (sys.argv),

44

00:02:29,980  -->  00:02:33,519
then we need to create an engine. So what

45

00:02:33,519  -->  00:02:36,099
an engine does is it connects the

46

00:02:36,099  -->  00:02:41,410
main qml it's the qml application engine

47

00:02:41,410  -->  00:02:45,819
that we can use to use qml in our

48

00:02:45,819  -->  00:02:47,410
applications. So I'm going to create a

49

00:02:47,410  -->  00:02:49,720
variable called engine and it's going to

50

00:02:49,720  -->  00:02:59,139
be = QQmlApplicationEngine, and it

51

00:02:59,139  -->  00:03:02,109
doesn't look like it picked it up so I'm

52

00:03:02,109  -->  00:03:04,540
just going to make sure that I imported

53

00:03:04,540  -->  00:03:17,910
everything.

54

00:03:17,910  -->  00:03:21,810
Alright, now our engine once we get it

55

00:03:21,810  -->  00:03:27,660
created we're going to have to load, we

56

00:03:27,660  -->  00:03:29,730
need to load a qml file. So we haven't

57

00:03:29,730  -->  00:03:30,900
created it yet but we're going to be

58

00:03:30,900  -->  00:03:34,380
calling it main.qml. So let's go

59

00:03:34,380  -->  00:03:37,800
ahead and write engine.load and here

60

00:03:37,800  -->  00:03:40,440
we're going to load a (QUrl) so

61

00:03:40,440  -->  00:03:43,290
this is going to make...that doesn't look

62

00:03:43,290  -->  00:03:45,930
right...

63

00:03:45,930  -->  00:03:50,460
QUrl, and in here the URL path we're

64

00:03:50,460  -->  00:03:53,610
going to be fromLocalFile,

65

00:03:53,610  -->  00:03:57,510
and then all we have to do is

66

00:03:57,510  -->  00:04:00,150
add a string here representing the file

67

00:04:00,150  -->  00:04:02,100
path. So it's gonna be ("main.qml")

68

00:04:02,100  -->  00:04:04,590
This is going to load up our qml

69

00:04:04,590  -->  00:04:06,750
and then what we're going to do is we're

70

00:04:06,750  -->  00:04:09,870
just going to show

71

00:04:09,870  -->  00:04:12,630
everything, so we need to target we need

72

00:04:12,630  -->  00:04:15,120
to create a window variable equal to

73

00:04:15,120  -->  00:04:22,470
window = engine.routeObjects( )[0] and this is

74

00:04:22,470  -->  00:04:24,840
actually a method, root objects is a method

75

00:04:24,840  -->  00:04:27,390
that returns route objects from the

76

00:04:27,390  -->  00:04:29,220
engine, so this is going to be the first

77

00:04:29,220  -->  00:04:32,010
node in our main qml file which is going

78

00:04:32,010  -->  00:04:35,400
to be an application window. Then we're

79

00:04:35,400  -->  00:04:39,750
going to write window.show( ), and then

80

00:04:39,750  -->  00:04:49,800
sys.exit(app.exec_( ) ). Alright,

81

00:04:49,800  -->  00:04:51,450
so this is literally all we need in

82

00:04:51,450  -->  00:04:53,700
Python, now we can start building out a qml

83

00:04:53,700  -->  00:04:55,860
file. So I'm going to go ahead and create

84

00:04:55,860  -->  00:04:59,220
a file called main.qml, and

85

00:04:59,220  -->  00:05:00,840
unfortunately we are not going to have

86

00:05:00,840  -->  00:05:04,650
syntax highlighting in this with

87

00:05:04,650  -->  00:05:09,360
pycharm, so that's unfortunate. However,

88

00:05:09,360  -->  00:05:11,370
we're going to deal with that,

89

00:05:11,370  -->  00:05:14,400
alright. So in qml we need to make some

90

00:05:14,400  -->  00:05:18,419
imports as well. Now if you're

91

00:05:18,419  -->  00:05:20,880
up to date on this the versions

92

00:05:20,880  -->  00:05:23,310
should be similar but you can always go

93

00:05:23,310  -->  00:05:25,890
look at the 5.x documentation

94

00:05:25,890  -->  00:05:27,150
on qts

95

00:05:27,150  -->  00:05:28,620
website and they should show you some

96

00:05:28,620  -->  00:05:31,050
examples of library versions. So,

97

00:05:31,050  -->  00:05:35,730
import QtQuick 2.7, again we have no

98

00:05:35,730  -->  00:05:37,260
syntax highlighting, we have no

99

00:05:37,260  -->  00:05:39,480
auto-completion, but that's fine for

100

00:05:39,480  -->  00:05:45,900
right now. We're going to import

101

00:05:45,900  -->  00:05:58,530
QtQuick.Window 2.2, import QtQuick.Controls

102

00:05:58,530  -->  00:06:02,940
1.4, these are all different version

103

00:06:02,940  -->  00:06:12,870
numbers I know, import QtGraphicalEffects 1.0

104

00:06:12,870  -->  00:06:18,000
Now in addition to this I mean this

105

00:06:18,000  -->  00:06:19,410
should be fine for what we're doing

106

00:06:19,410  -->  00:06:21,420
right now actually so let's go ahead and

107

00:06:21,420  -->  00:06:24,960
and get some stuff rolling. So, we're

108

00:06:24,960  -->  00:06:27,510
actually going to start writing in qml

109

00:06:27,510  -->  00:06:29,220
now so this is going to be different

110

00:06:29,220  -->  00:06:31,140
from python you're probably going to

111

00:06:31,140  -->  00:06:33,270
recognize, I mean again it's declarative

112

00:06:33,270  -->  00:06:36,600
so it's more similar to HTML, CSS, and

113

00:06:36,600  -->  00:06:38,610
JavaScript than anything else, so we need

114

00:06:38,610  -->  00:06:40,860
to create our route object in this case

115

00:06:40,860  -->  00:06:44,610
it's going to be ApplicationWindow, and how you

116

00:06:44,610  -->  00:06:47,430
open up elements in qml is you put curly

117

00:06:47,430  -->  00:06:52,230
braces like that. Now we're going to give

118

00:06:52,230  -->  00:06:57,120
it an id: equal mainWindow, and this

119

00:06:57,120  -->  00:06:59,130
is so that if we want to change anything to

120

00:06:59,130  -->  00:07:00,960
do with this from other elements we can

121

00:07:00,960  -->  00:07:03,000
do it and in that case it's kind of like

122

00:07:03,000  -->  00:07:04,380
JavaScript and i'll show you guys that

123

00:07:04,380  -->  00:07:06,690
in a moment. We're going to set the

124

00:07:06,690  -->  00:07:10,290
height for right now the default is

125

00:07:10,290  -->  00:07:14,400
going to be 160, and the width is going

126

00:07:14,400  -->  00:07:21,720
to be say 300,

127

00:07:21,720  -->  00:07:24,480
and we're going to create an item in

128

00:07:24,480  -->  00:07:27,480
here. So, go ahead create an element

129

00:07:27,480  -->  00:07:29,610
called item and this is going to be our

130

00:07:29,610  -->  00:07:30,990
main page that we're going to be putting

131

00:07:30,990  -->  00:07:33,990
stuff into. So go ahead and give it an id:

132

00:07:33,990  -->  00:07:39,150
page, and again right now this isn't

133

00:07:39,150  -->  00:07:41,820
really important to give them all ids.

134

00:07:41,820  -->  00:07:44,100
Visible is going to be set true we need

135

00:07:44,100  -->  00:07:46,710
to do this in order to make the window

136

00:07:46,710  -->  00:07:49,350
of the application itself visible, and

137

00:07:49,350  -->  00:07:50,970
then the width of this is going to be

138

00:07:50,970  -->  00:08:00,270
parents.width. Now what we're going to

139

00:08:00,270  -->  00:08:04,560
do is add a rectangle in here, if I can spell

140

00:08:04,560  -->  00:08:07,170
it correctly, and as you guys can see

141

00:08:07,170  -->  00:08:10,320
creating elements is very similar

142

00:08:10,320  -->  00:08:13,230
as you go down, so it's again like HTML.

143

00:08:13,230  -->  00:08:14,970
We're gonna take away some space there

144

00:08:14,970  -->  00:08:18,060
to keep the attributes separate from the

145

00:08:18,060  -->  00:08:24,870
child elements. Height is going to be 160, so the

146

00:08:24,870  -->  00:08:28,110
same as the main window, and you can do

147

00:08:28,110  -->  00:08:34,260
this in JavaScript as well. So, let's go

148

00:08:34,260  -->  00:08:36,300
ahead how you add javascript to a

149

00:08:36,300  -->  00:08:38,760
property here is you open up curly

150

00:08:38,760  -->  00:08:42,510
brackets and in here you can type stuff

151

00:08:42,510  -->  00:08:50,400
like regular JavaScript, and then you can

152

00:08:50,400  -->  00:08:54,690
return 160. Now it's important to note

153

00:08:54,690  -->  00:08:58,200
that in here you do not use semi-colons

154

00:08:58,200  -->  00:09:00,180
to end statements,

155

00:09:00,180  -->  00:09:01,890
it's kind of like JavaScript but it's

156

00:09:01,890  -->  00:09:04,020
not really javascript. We will go over the

157

00:09:04,020  -->  00:09:07,680
differences soon. Now the color we're

158

00:09:07,680  -->  00:09:12,089
going to set it to is going to be lets

159

00:09:12,089  -->  00:09:15,810
say, actually you don't need quotes there,

160

00:09:15,810  -->  00:09:20,730
going to be not white because that's the

161

00:09:20,730  -->  00:09:26,050
default color so let's go with red.

162

00:09:26,050  -->  00:09:32,320
And now we're going to create text, the

163

00:09:32,320  -->  00:09:35,110
text node itself.

164

00:09:35,110  -->  00:09:38,920
So go ahead and create text, the property in

165

00:09:38,920  -->  00:09:41,230
here that's going to be relevant is text. In

166

00:09:41,230  -->  00:09:44,470
here you can type in "I am some regular

167

00:09:44,470  -->  00:09:48,700
text" Now we're going to set the height

168

00:09:48,700  -->  00:09:53,980
of this to 50, we're going to set the width

169

00:09:53,980  -->  00:09:58,390
equal to parents width so parent.width,

170

00:09:58,390  -->  00:10:03,820
and we're going to set the pixel size, so

171

00:10:03,820  -->  00:10:08,589
in in CSS you type font size, here you

172

00:10:08,589  -->  00:10:13,660
will type font.pixelSize and i'm

173

00:10:13,660  -->  00:10:18,279
going to set it to 12, and then you can

174

00:10:18,279  -->  00:10:20,829
also set some other parameters in here

175

00:10:20,829  -->  00:10:22,060
but I'm not going to this should be

176

00:10:22,060  -->  00:10:23,140
enough right now. I'm going to go ahead

177

00:10:23,140  -->  00:10:25,660
and save this, I'm going to run the main

178

00:10:25,660  -->  00:10:31,660
file, and we should see a window you

179

00:10:31,660  -->  00:10:35,020
created...engine.rootObjects index out

180

00:10:35,020  -->  00:10:36,220
of range.

181

00:10:36,220  -->  00:10:43,860
Alright, well that's not good at all.

182

00:10:43,860  -->  00:10:51,830
Let's come back here and have a look...

183

00:10:57,860  -->  00:11:23,800
we got the application created.

184

00:11:23,800  -->  00:11:26,470
That's unexpected token, so that's

185

00:11:26,470  -->  00:11:30,220
because in here we have that. We could

186

00:11:30,220  -->  00:11:44,260
escape that then restart. Line 22

187

00:11:44,260  -->  00:11:45,700
don't need to put these quotes I

188

00:11:45,700  -->  00:11:47,740
believe, I think you should just work

189

00:11:47,740  -->  00:12:03,540
like regular x colors...

190

00:12:03,540  -->  00:12:07,110
There we go and as you can see we've got,

191

00:12:07,110  -->  00:12:11,699
let me toggle back here let's focus on it,

192

00:12:11,699  -->  00:12:14,130
we've now got a window that just has

193

00:12:14,130  -->  00:12:17,430
some regular text here. Now what we could

194

00:12:17,430  -->  00:12:20,880
do is we can move this text around, we

195

00:12:20,880  -->  00:12:22,860
can set the window title, and in fact

196

00:12:22,860  -->  00:12:23,759
that's what we're going to be doing

197

00:12:23,759  -->  00:12:24,930
first.

198

00:12:24,930  -->  00:12:27,029
So, in order to set the window title

199

00:12:27,029  -->  00:12:31,050
you're just going to give the application

200

00:12:31,050  -->  00:12:36,540
window a title: "My Window" so save it

201

00:12:36,540  -->  00:12:40,079
and restart it. You're going to see now the

202

00:12:40,079  -->  00:12:43,110
window has a title called my window and

203

00:12:43,110  -->  00:12:46,290
we can also move it. Now we can also set

204

00:12:46,290  -->  00:12:47,940
other properties in here and we're going

205

00:12:47,940  -->  00:12:50,220
to be going over that in the next video.

206

00:12:50,220  -->  00:12:51,720
We're going to be going over

207

00:12:51,720  -->  00:12:53,910
different elements and how we can use

208

00:12:53,910  -->  00:12:55,649
them, and then we'll get into making some

209

00:12:55,649  -->  00:13:01,250
programs.
