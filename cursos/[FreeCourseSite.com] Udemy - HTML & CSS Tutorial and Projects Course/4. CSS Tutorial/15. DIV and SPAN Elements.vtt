00:00.860 --> 00:02.430
While working with Asian.

00:02.780 --> 00:05.450
We didn't cover two specific elements.

00:05.450 --> 00:07.920
One was Dave and the other one was bad.

00:08.390 --> 00:13.790
Now the reason why I didn't cover them because I didn't find it useful with an HMO because they're used

00:13.790 --> 00:14.770
for grouping.

00:14.840 --> 00:22.350
However in essence these two elements are going to come very very powerful and very very useful.

00:22.380 --> 00:24.860
So again as always let's look at the example.

00:24.920 --> 00:28.200
So first of all let me just keep this green on the colors.

00:28.220 --> 00:31.540
Gonna stay green as well as when I keep this class all right.

00:31.610 --> 00:33.660
Just to show you how basically things work.

00:33.890 --> 00:37.500
Now I'm gonna get rid of the titles and the ideas and everything else.

00:37.550 --> 00:40.760
So let me save it and let's head over back to indexation.

00:41.510 --> 00:44.890
Now in the indexation memo I'm gonna create a heading.

00:44.930 --> 00:49.630
Let's say 3 with a title heading number one.

00:49.910 --> 00:53.610
Ring a ding number one.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.500
And let's add maybe a paragraph with.

00:56.540 --> 00:59.900
I'm sorry I would have to first have a paragraph with.

01:00.040 --> 01:00.480
I don't know.

01:00.480 --> 01:05.530
Text like I don't know 10 words or you know what one that's gonna be our partner.

01:05.660 --> 01:11.300
Now what I would like to do right now is copy and paste the same thing here and let's write adding not

01:11.390 --> 01:14.520
number one but this is gonna be heading number two.

01:14.540 --> 01:20.780
And also let's decide that somewhere within the second paragraph there is gonna be some text and I'm

01:20.780 --> 01:28.910
gonna add my own text where I'm gonna say Hey I am I am uppercase and I'm gonna write here A I am uppercase.

01:29.060 --> 01:33.590
So we would like to have this text on it and I'm gonna place it in two places.

01:33.980 --> 01:38.420
So I'm gonna say the first one is gonna be here and the second one is gonna be somewhere over here.

01:38.540 --> 01:42.630
And again this all is gonna make sense literally in a second.

01:42.650 --> 01:43.680
Now what happen.

01:43.970 --> 01:46.540
So I would like this heading.

01:46.580 --> 01:52.970
So the heading number one and the paragraph to be read as well as the heading three.

01:53.240 --> 01:59.630
The second heading as was the paragraph to be blue so long let's think about it again.

01:59.660 --> 02:05.210
I cannot select all the herring 3s because I would want them different as well as I can select all the

02:05.210 --> 02:08.270
paragraphs because it will work the same way.

02:08.330 --> 02:14.450
Now again we can say well we can easily just add here the grouping or we can add the ideas.

02:14.480 --> 02:18.770
However there is a better way so we can use this and plan for it.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.080
Like I said Devon's plan would be used for grouping.

02:21.680 --> 02:25.580
So first let me create a element and the element is gonna be very simple.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.470
So we just write a div that's all.

02:27.470 --> 02:33.350
Since that is the name of the UN and now I'd like to place the ending tag for this div where I would

02:33.350 --> 02:34.630
want the group something.

02:34.710 --> 02:39.140
So in my case I want to group the heading 3 as was the program the first program.

02:39.350 --> 02:43.240
So I'm gonna head over here in the moment we served notice nothing happened.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.340
Nothing literally changes now okay.

02:46.620 --> 02:47.810
However that was a good start.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.720
Now why don't we do the same thing with the span.

02:50.720 --> 02:55.970
However in this case we're going to work with this hey I'm uppercase So again right before this text

02:56.080 --> 02:57.110
I am uppercase.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.090
Let's create a span element.

02:59.210 --> 03:01.830
Now let's say that I would like to work with an upper case.

03:01.910 --> 03:06.040
So I'm gonna grab this whatever text and I'm gonna copy and paste it here.

03:06.050 --> 03:08.030
Now I would like to do the same thing with this guy.

03:08.030 --> 03:09.560
So we have few options.

03:09.650 --> 03:14.450
We can either just copy and paste everything that we had here or you know what I didn't want to cut

03:14.450 --> 03:20.800
it out let's say copy and we're going to replace whatever text we had already with this part.

03:20.930 --> 03:26.210
And again the moment we do this nothing changes in our actual browser so we might be tempted.

03:26.210 --> 03:29.640
Thinking Well listen there's something wrong with this what's happening.

03:30.350 --> 03:34.880
Well we should already know that we can use just the simple elements like this right.

03:35.300 --> 03:40.880
So we can head over back and we're going to say for all my divs I would want to first have some kind

03:40.880 --> 03:43.010
of color and the background.

03:43.010 --> 03:48.290
So again we can just copy and paste whatever properties in the values and let's noticed something interesting.

03:49.070 --> 03:56.330
So right away what's happening is the div element that had been heading in the paragraph has the styles

03:56.360 --> 03:59.660
that we want it just by obviously using our element select.

04:00.550 --> 04:06.800
Okay let's start out the same thing with the span let's say for the span we're gonna use text transform

04:06.800 --> 04:13.720
again property that we're going to cover later on we as an object now also we notice something interesting.

04:14.030 --> 04:21.960
So everywhere we use the span we were able to grow whatever we placed within a span and add these styles.

04:22.010 --> 04:24.100
Now I'm not going to cover right now.

04:24.290 --> 04:30.980
The reasoning for why this is basically displayed one way and the span is gonna be in the in line because

04:30.980 --> 04:36.230
we're going to cover this as we start talking about the box model because for now what we're saying

04:36.230 --> 04:42.110
is that there is just a difference with a day if we are basically starting a new line and the span we're

04:42.110 --> 04:46.910
using for inline style and in general this would be the block level element.

04:47.060 --> 04:51.100
And this is gonna be the in line now but again we're going to cover this later on of course.

04:51.260 --> 04:56.510
What I would like to understand that whenever we're gonna be using defined and span this is gonna be

04:56.510 --> 04:57.720
used for grouping.

04:57.800 --> 05:03.770
So if you want a group something together we're gonna place this in a div and if we would like to style

05:03.770 --> 05:08.150
this as a block element then the devs are gonna be important.

05:08.150 --> 05:13.700
How or if you'd like to style something as the inline element whereas you notice it's not starting a

05:13.700 --> 05:19.490
new line and then we're gonna use respond but again we're going to cover this later on in much more

05:19.490 --> 05:20.450
detail.

05:20.450 --> 05:26.510
For now though what is gonna happen with the set second heading through and the part where because remember

05:26.510 --> 05:29.330
we wanted the second one to also have different styles.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.220
And for now we have the Dave.

05:31.880 --> 05:38.870
Now if I'm gonna add another div here I'm gonna say okay so there's gonna be a second Dave and let me

05:38.870 --> 05:45.040
cut this out and let's say that I'm gonna obviously end where I would like to end my grouping.

05:45.050 --> 05:47.360
So this is gonna be at the end of the paragraph.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.870
Now both of them are obviously having the same styles.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.470
Now this is not what we want.

05:52.490 --> 05:52.820
Right.

05:53.180 --> 05:59.480
So we wanted the second one to have just a green color but say well we know that we can use classes.

06:00.110 --> 06:05.120
So this is where the divs become important because we can add these classes and say you know there's

06:05.120 --> 06:10.880
gonna be class and we already have the classes so I'm gonna have the class right now at the moment nothing

06:10.880 --> 06:11.400
changes.

06:11.780 --> 06:17.040
So obviously we have the both the same things or what if I'm gonna get rid of this Dave.

06:17.370 --> 06:20.620
So I'm not going to select anything anymore with a div.

06:20.840 --> 06:24.050
Notice the first one I was like has the class.

06:24.140 --> 06:27.800
Now I can head over back to the second one and say you know what.

06:27.950 --> 06:35.390
Okay for this guy let's add the cross agree so the power of div and the span is the fact that not only

06:35.390 --> 06:41.630
we can style them as elements like we can also add whatever ideas we would want whatever classes we

06:41.630 --> 06:48.480
would want and that way we can start grouping things together and adding whatever styles we would like.

06:48.530 --> 06:50.510
Now how also is going to work with this part.

06:50.990 --> 06:58.540
So let's say that I have this I am uppercase Well I can head over the first one since I wouldn't want

06:58.600 --> 07:00.950
all my plans just to be uppercase.

07:01.180 --> 07:06.000
But let's imagine there's going to be span where I would like to reuse my class all right.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.410
Okay.

07:07.470 --> 07:12.120
All we have to do is just add declassified and let's see what happened.

07:12.130 --> 07:17.360
So not only the span that has the class of red is getting these styles.

07:17.470 --> 07:22.910
Now again please don't focus on the fact that there's our block level elements and the spans are gonna

07:22.920 --> 07:28.270
be in line level alignment because we haven't covered that but just remember that whenever we would

07:28.270 --> 07:35.770
like to group something we can either use Dave or we can use the span and just in a very basic level

07:36.090 --> 07:42.100
span we're going to use if we would like to start something within the text already so we wouldn't want

07:42.100 --> 07:43.810
to start a new line.

07:43.870 --> 07:48.000
However Dave we would style if we would want to start as a block level.

07:48.340 --> 07:53.570
So just to give you an idea if I'm gonna head over here and change the span to the Dave.

07:53.800 --> 07:57.720
So let's say there is gonna be Dave instead of a class of span.

07:57.820 --> 08:00.830
I'm sorry Dave with a class or read instead on the span.

08:00.910 --> 08:01.840
Notice what happens.

08:02.190 --> 08:05.430
So in this case we will gonna start a new line.

08:05.650 --> 08:11.590
So instead of just tiling everything in line so again that would be the most basic differences but we're

08:11.590 --> 08:14.010
gonna cover the more differences later on.
