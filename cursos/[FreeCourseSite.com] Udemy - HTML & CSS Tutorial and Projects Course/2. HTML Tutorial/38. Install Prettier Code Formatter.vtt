00:00.430 --> 00:04.500
How some were done covering the most important parts of any amount.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.800
Again this is just my opinion.

00:06.840 --> 00:12.150
Obviously you can find more and more information about more and more elements but in my opinion this

00:12.150 --> 00:15.500
would be in more than enough to get up and running with HDMI.

00:15.990 --> 00:21.690
Now before we dive into our first Asian e-mail project I would like to cover two things that I find

00:21.690 --> 00:26.490
really important regarding whether we are working with JavaScript whether we're working with e-mail

00:26.640 --> 00:32.120
or sources and those would be keyboard shortcuts as well as formatting our code.

00:32.120 --> 00:35.970
Now let's start with the easiest one which would be for the making our code.

00:35.970 --> 00:39.480
So we already know that the amount is whitespace collapsing.

00:39.480 --> 00:39.720
Right.

00:40.110 --> 00:44.940
So if we're going to write here let's say paragraph organizer types some text that I'm going to have

00:44.940 --> 00:46.980
more space and I'm gonna type more text.

00:47.370 --> 00:48.260
I'm going to save it.

00:48.270 --> 00:54.780
The whole text is gonna be displayed only with this one space since everything else is collapsed however

00:54.840 --> 01:01.070
has been working in the project in our e-mail or I'm sorry with our text error.

01:01.080 --> 01:07.380
Notice how this gets really annoying really fast where we do have these spaces and again for now we

01:07.380 --> 01:11.380
have what we have body with one paragraph element.

01:11.570 --> 01:16.440
I wonder if I'm gonna add another one like that if I'm going to say again another paragraph again time

01:16.440 --> 01:23.460
some mumbo jumbo gibberish there's something like this and the idea yeah what's going to happen again

01:23.730 --> 01:26.220
it's gonna get really hard to work.

01:26.310 --> 01:31.640
Now granted right now I'm obviously zooming in just so we can see everything better enough material

01:31.980 --> 01:37.240
but in general you wouldn't want something like this because it's gonna make your life really hard.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.940
You will gonna get annoyed really really quickly.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.480
So what would be the solution for this.

01:42.480 --> 01:48.060
Well you could say I mean jeez just don't do that just delete everything and make sure that everything

01:48.060 --> 01:50.430
is displayed correctly and that is true.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.110
Yes you could do that.

01:52.260 --> 01:53.810
However there is a better way.

01:53.910 --> 01:59.460
There is more automated way where I don't have to worry about what I'm doing.

01:59.460 --> 02:04.620
Meaning whether I'm actually typing everything correctly we can use the formatting for that.

02:05.370 --> 02:10.760
And in order to get up and running with the formatting we would need to install another extension.

02:10.890 --> 02:17.040
So already we know the spiel we all gonna have to head over what this like on click on extensions.

02:17.100 --> 02:21.830
For now we should have like server only installed unless you installed something else.

02:21.990 --> 02:27.840
And here on top search bar we're gonna write three and then we're gonna be looking for two T's.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.680
This should gives us the preview here.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.820
This is what we're looking for to install.

02:31.860 --> 02:38.070
So we're gonna click on this and we're gonna install our as we before we installing or right after we

02:38.070 --> 02:39.880
install it doesn't really matter.

02:39.900 --> 02:44.020
They tell us to use this Ed in that format on site.

02:44.550 --> 02:47.960
So this is something that we should also change in our settings.

02:47.970 --> 02:50.270
This is kind of important for this to work.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.790
First of all let's click on install and let's see.

02:53.840 --> 02:58.340
By the time this is going to be done installing I'm probably going to tell you my whole life story.

02:58.390 --> 02:59.380
No hopefully not.

02:59.390 --> 03:03.650
But as you can see takes for some reason quite a long time.

03:03.650 --> 03:07.500
So hopefully it will gonna be done installing and sure enough it does.

03:07.580 --> 03:12.870
So now I can reload my text and her first of all this is gonna be my first point.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.770
Then I would like to close probably these extensions.

03:15.770 --> 03:23.080
We can just go back again to our folder structure and now let's navigate to the settings and again we're

03:23.080 --> 03:24.530
gonna have to look for two things.

03:24.980 --> 03:27.920
So first one is gonna be editor format on save.

03:28.130 --> 03:32.980
So you can just write editor and you know this is not gonna give me what I wanted.

03:33.110 --> 03:36.710
This probably would work better here in the Jason object.

03:36.770 --> 03:39.200
Just write more math on save.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.820
So this should give us an option.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.620
And this is what I was looking for.

03:43.100 --> 03:46.070
So we have format on paste and format on set.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.190
So now I would like to click both of them.

03:49.190 --> 03:51.600
And again since this is gonna auto save.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.590
We don't need to save it anywhere else.

03:53.690 --> 03:55.710
And now let's go back to our file.

03:55.820 --> 03:57.580
So what's gonna happen again.

03:57.620 --> 04:03.500
For now everything is not formatted but let's say again I'm gonna add one more paragraph so let's create

04:03.500 --> 04:09.560
here another paragraph so I'm going to have the paragraph tags and for some reason I can get them.

04:09.560 --> 04:15.200
And again let's write it the same way where we're just typing some something that doesn't really make

04:15.200 --> 04:15.950
sense.

04:16.100 --> 04:19.100
Now the moment we're gonna press save notice what happens.

04:19.130 --> 04:26.550
So now the Visual Studio code with the help with our extension formats everything nicely.

04:26.570 --> 04:32.700
Now I understand that now it might not seem very useful because we really have three paragraphs and

04:33.110 --> 04:36.620
all the editorial that we did was pretty much six lines of code.

04:37.400 --> 04:43.140
However as we're gonna start working with the project and as you're gonna keep on working with assess

04:43.140 --> 04:49.460
and see as this project format in your code is really gonna help you out in a long run.

04:49.460 --> 04:55.610
And by the way you did need to restart the server as obviously we did reload the server.

04:55.610 --> 05:01.670
So I did this already behind the scenes but if you didn't do it then you're gonna have only two paragraphs

05:01.670 --> 05:02.390
shown.

05:02.480 --> 05:05.350
So again you would need to restart the server by going line.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.370
And just to make my point across.

05:08.540 --> 05:14.330
You should want to have some kind of formatting for your code because this is gonna be really painful

05:14.660 --> 05:16.420
if you're gonna have to do it manually.
