WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:03.310
So let's go to maintain this and start styling.

00:03.420 --> 00:03.740
Right.

00:03.750 --> 00:06.690
And the first thing that we're going to create is actually for the title.

00:06.690 --> 00:07.180
Right.

00:07.230 --> 00:11.140
Because remember all this is going to be our title that we're going to be actually reusing.

00:11.190 --> 00:11.700
All right.

00:11.810 --> 00:13.290
So we're going to go here.

00:13.320 --> 00:18.430
I know this is going to say this is going to be tied up and just do a few things.

00:18.580 --> 00:24.090
First of going to say tied up and we're going to have a property of margin and we're going to save 40

00:24.090 --> 00:28.610
pixels and zero on this or here.

00:28.860 --> 00:31.310
Then we are going to have a title text.

00:31.330 --> 00:39.060
Right so we're going to go here and we're going to say this is going to be a title or text or this and

00:39.060 --> 00:43.230
we're going to say this is going to be text all the time text.

00:43.350 --> 00:45.240
I'm going to say Santa.

00:45.590 --> 00:53.580
They're all going to have a font size over here of what the size or your font size.

00:53.700 --> 01:00.420
We're going to say 40 pixels then we're going to have a color and the color is actually going to be

01:00.470 --> 01:06.540
hashtag e zero e to d be like this.

01:06.540 --> 01:14.380
And then we're going to have a fun style and style like this and we're going to say taluk and then we're

01:14.460 --> 01:24.270
going to have a text transformation uppercase right so text transformation uppercase right so nice is

01:24.270 --> 01:25.770
going to be our big text.

01:25.770 --> 01:34.010
And then we need to create a title underline or Hirose title and we're going to say title on the line.

01:34.190 --> 01:34.800
Right.

01:34.830 --> 01:43.140
And what we should have is with or here of 200 pixels on like this then we're going to have a border

01:44.100 --> 01:52.310
of three pixels solid with two or three pixels solid and we're going to say this is going to be six

01:52.810 --> 01:59.780
A and then we're going to have F to E F to the right and then we just need to do the margins are going

01:59.780 --> 02:01.660
to say margin 0 Arto.

02:01.920 --> 02:07.170
So now you can see that it's exactly in the middle now and then we're done with the title or and actually

02:07.170 --> 02:15.170
start styling services services here and then we're going to have first rule for the whole section.

02:15.540 --> 02:18.900
So we're going to sell your services sir.

02:19.010 --> 02:23.700
Mrs. Reagan we're here and they're all going to say what kind of role she should have.

02:23.700 --> 02:24.240
Right.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.270
So minimal height.

02:25.290 --> 02:26.430
We're going to give it this time.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.370
You right.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.400
100.

02:28.510 --> 02:28.990
Right.

02:29.160 --> 02:32.230
And the laws are going to copy Actually from what I already had.

02:32.250 --> 02:32.910
Right.

02:32.910 --> 02:37.200
So if we scroll all the way to the top right you can see that we have this one right and we're just

02:37.200 --> 02:42.660
going to copy this one right now the difference is we're not going to need a linear gradient and we

02:42.660 --> 02:44.980
also need this display Flaccus right.

02:45.150 --> 02:46.780
So we're is it going to go here.

02:47.040 --> 02:53.910
We're going to say copy right and scroll the way all the way in the bottom right and just copy and paste

02:53.920 --> 02:54.940
or here right.

02:55.230 --> 02:56.700
So copy and paste it.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.700
And when we get rid of linear gradient like this.

03:00.830 --> 03:03.200
Now I can see that we have the image right.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.560
And everything is working.

03:04.560 --> 03:05.860
Everything is fine.

03:05.970 --> 03:11.400
Now the only difference is that right now we do want some little bit of time right.

03:11.490 --> 03:12.850
So we're going to go here.

03:13.110 --> 03:20.090
And I was going to say that we would want a padding and we want a padding of 20 pixels or here that

03:20.230 --> 03:22.230
we would want a zero.

03:22.390 --> 03:29.420
Then you want 80 pixels here and this and then we're going to have again another zero.

03:29.530 --> 03:29.820
All right.

03:29.820 --> 03:35.400
So pretty much top and bottom right padding and a sidewards going to leave it like the way it is.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.090
Right.

03:36.120 --> 03:40.050
The next guy we're going to have is actually service container right.

03:40.110 --> 03:42.320
You can see that you know what let's change the image.

03:42.430 --> 03:48.590
The actual images services are going to go back on here and I'm going to change the image as it is doesn't

03:48.600 --> 03:50.060
make a difference right.

03:50.080 --> 03:54.490
So I don't have a better looking image for this particular part.

03:54.720 --> 04:00.400
I'm going to say Services and say container container.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.130
Right.

04:01.150 --> 04:05.680
And once we have this we're going to have a max with more here.

04:05.730 --> 04:12.750
We're going to say this is going to be 90 and you board right like this you believe and they're all

04:12.750 --> 04:18.060
going to have a margin 0 0 all over going to place in the center.

04:18.210 --> 04:25.020
And then we're going to have a caller or here hashtag the zero G and then we're going to have to be

04:25.530 --> 04:25.740
right.

04:25.740 --> 04:30.650
So now we're going to have a white collar and then we're going to have a service item.

04:30.710 --> 04:30.990
Right.

04:30.990 --> 04:33.450
So now we're actually dealing with this whole thing.

04:33.480 --> 04:33.970
Right.

04:34.130 --> 04:37.060
And the first thing we need is actually the service either.

04:37.290 --> 04:43.750
So we're here we're going to say service service we're going to say item right.

04:43.770 --> 04:45.210
And what should happen.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.940
We're all going to say that this is going to be overflow hidden.

04:48.300 --> 04:54.570
So we're going to say we're going to say hit it right once we have this you're going to say position

04:54.570 --> 05:02.520
relative position relative and that we're going to have the padding I'm going to say the padding is

05:02.520 --> 05:08.400
actually going to be 60 pixels or 60 pixels or here like this.

05:08.400 --> 05:08.860
Right.

05:08.910 --> 05:12.710
So you can see that we first we created a padding right.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.710
And then we actually created a relative head.

05:15.810 --> 05:16.300
Right.

05:16.320 --> 05:21.010
And you'll see why we had actually these two properties just in a sec.

05:21.070 --> 05:21.690
Right.

05:21.690 --> 05:30.160
So the next one we would want a service item from some say service or here and I'm going to say Fantastic.

05:30.190 --> 05:30.650
Right.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.310
So now we're targeting the font.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.190
Awesome.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.910
I'm going to say font size.

05:35.100 --> 05:42.030
We're going to say 60 pixels then we're going to have a margin margin bottom or here we're going to

05:42.030 --> 05:44.270
say this is going to be 30 pixels.

05:44.270 --> 05:44.840
Right.

05:45.060 --> 05:54.600
We're going to have a caller and the caller over here is going to be easy or here 6 8 6 8 and then it's

05:54.600 --> 05:57.970
going to be half to do.

05:58.140 --> 05:58.630
Healing.

05:58.710 --> 06:03.850
So we're pretty much creating a color for it to be obviously.

06:03.950 --> 06:06.140
All right so we have the same hair color.

06:06.480 --> 06:12.430
Then over here we're all going to do is we're going to save that for this service item black.

06:12.440 --> 06:12.720
Right.

06:12.720 --> 06:17.820
So first let's go and remember when we have one service item was black and the other one was white.

06:17.830 --> 06:18.280
Right.

06:18.480 --> 06:24.930
So we're all going to say sir this and I'm we're going to say black and white what's going to happen

06:24.930 --> 06:26.650
or we're going to say background.

06:26.660 --> 06:26.890
Right.

06:26.910 --> 06:33.660
And now we're going to have a linear linear gradient here like this and then we're going to say this

06:33.660 --> 06:38.760
is going to be our GPA and we're going to say this is zero zero zero.

06:38.910 --> 06:44.300
And this is going to be point seven no going to copy this one and it's all going to grab this guy over

06:44.310 --> 06:52.200
here and press copy and out here place a comma or here and this is going to be a semi go right.

06:52.380 --> 06:54.590
So you can see what happened with the black ones right.

06:54.750 --> 06:55.640
You can see how they look.

06:55.680 --> 06:59.560
They had actually the black overlay.

06:59.630 --> 07:00.280
Right.

07:00.300 --> 07:05.390
And as always we need to do the same thing with a white one right.

07:05.430 --> 07:07.700
So here we can just copy this one.

07:07.920 --> 07:11.950
This one new real going to say this is going to be white.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.010
So a white and over here we're going to change these values.

07:16.010 --> 07:16.230
Right.

07:16.230 --> 07:18.560
So this is going to be two point six.

07:18.810 --> 07:27.750
Then the next one is going to be 2 0 8 and then over here we're going to have a 2 0 6 and all here this

07:27.750 --> 07:29.500
is going to be 0.6.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.000
And the next one is going to be exactly the same.

07:32.010 --> 07:32.220
Right.

07:32.220 --> 07:34.710
So again we have few options.

07:34.830 --> 07:40.330
We can just copy this one actually pasted or however you would want right.

07:40.500 --> 07:49.250
So here I'm going to leave this guy here and we're going to have a bracket and pasted over here.

07:49.270 --> 07:50.870
Now we have two of them right.

07:51.060 --> 07:54.040
And this is going to be actually you can see it is different now or later right.

07:54.210 --> 07:55.880
So this is going to be this way.

07:55.900 --> 08:01.190
All right and for the love letter overlay we need to change the color so I'm going to send the court

08:01.190 --> 08:05.000
is going to be 1 9 1 7 1 6.

08:05.080 --> 08:13.230
Right so we're going to make it a darker color and then over here what you want to start actually styling

08:13.230 --> 08:14.920
these front and back text.

08:14.940 --> 08:15.550
Right.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.430
So technically this font also Mike on this title is the Frontex.

08:19.620 --> 08:25.220
And this is the text that's cannot actually appear so that's why I'm going to call it a back.

08:25.260 --> 08:25.830
All right.

08:25.830 --> 08:30.240
So front text more here and that's what's going to happen.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.560
I'm going to say this is going to be text on center thanks to.

08:33.580 --> 08:34.960
I'm going to say.

08:35.230 --> 08:41.190
And they're We're going to have transition right here and I'm going to say transform and we're going

08:41.190 --> 08:42.710
to say two seconds.

08:42.830 --> 08:43.740
Or here like this.

08:43.740 --> 08:44.250
Right.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.760
So this is for the Frontex to actually move up.

08:46.800 --> 08:52.260
Right now we have a back text that actually needs to also move up.

08:52.260 --> 08:55.330
Right but first we need to move actually done.

08:55.580 --> 08:59.800
Sorry I'm going to say back text and then we're going to have a properties.

09:00.090 --> 09:00.740
Right.

09:00.750 --> 09:06.180
So first we want is position absolute we're willing to say absolute right.

09:06.180 --> 09:08.840
So pretty much trying to get rid of this guy right.

09:08.850 --> 09:10.680
We don't want it to be shown in the beginning.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.150
Right.

09:11.220 --> 09:16.280
And therefore we had all this position relative so we can play around with this position absolutely

09:16.400 --> 09:16.880
right.

09:16.950 --> 09:21.330
And also here is our lay here didn't have to be or here so we can hide this guy.

09:21.330 --> 09:21.910
Right.

09:21.940 --> 09:27.640
So he was going to say bottom and bottom is going to be negative 15 times.

09:27.760 --> 09:28.250
Right.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.710
And you're just going to have to believe me.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.100
What we're doing right now right.

09:31.110 --> 09:33.180
Because I obviously set everything right.

09:33.280 --> 09:37.260
And but if you if you want you can add this to last so you can see what we're actually doing.

09:37.260 --> 09:37.690
All right.

09:37.860 --> 09:44.350
So here I'm going to say this is going to be with so only 5 percent or here then you are going to say

09:44.350 --> 09:49.770
it again the margin we're going to have zero auto then we're going to have a height and we're going

09:49.770 --> 09:54.360
to say this is going to be a hundred percent there we're going to have a transition.

09:54.440 --> 09:54.720
Right.

09:54.750 --> 09:57.390
And this is going to be actually bottom transition right.

09:57.400 --> 10:04.200
I'm going to say bottom we're going to say two seconds and then we're going to have a party of 30 pixels

10:04.710 --> 10:06.540
and zero pixels.

10:06.590 --> 10:10.780
And then what do we would want to do is actually style the heading one.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.760
All right so we're going to go back over here.

10:12.810 --> 10:19.340
We're going to say black text black text or here we're going to say having one.

10:19.380 --> 10:26.740
And what should happen I'm going to say margin and margin bottom here and we're going to say 20 pixels.

10:26.890 --> 10:27.460
Right.

10:27.480 --> 10:30.910
So again you're going to have to believe me what we're doing right.

10:30.930 --> 10:35.000
And because you're going to be later on you will see actually how everything looks like.

10:35.100 --> 10:41.580
So the next one is actually going to be able to get back text and then we're going to say this is going

10:41.580 --> 10:42.740
to be BOTTEN.

10:42.760 --> 10:43.080
Right.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.700
And what should happen to the button.

10:44.740 --> 10:45.470
Right.

10:45.480 --> 10:48.360
So first we're going to see margin top.

10:48.420 --> 10:53.770
And we're going to say let's say 20 pixels and then we're going to be a padding.

10:53.970 --> 11:01.290
We're going to say 10 pixels or 20 pixels when they don't have a background and we're going to have

11:01.380 --> 11:02.550
a transparent

11:04.380 --> 11:13.680
transparent or this will have a border and the border is going to be two pixels solid and then we're

11:13.680 --> 11:15.360
going to change this one around right.

11:15.530 --> 11:20.690
So this is going to be hash tag and not border and border.

11:20.850 --> 11:25.950
And here are going to say it's going to be six or here.

11:26.390 --> 11:29.810
And then this is going to be EF 2 EF 2.

11:30.210 --> 11:36.050
So there's guy the name of font size for the button font size.

11:36.090 --> 11:42.930
And then we have 20 pixels or here and the color and the color is going to be again this is going to

11:43.130 --> 11:47.090
read more here 6 a.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.780
And after we have to.

11:50.970 --> 11:55.700
So now we have this set up and now it wants something we're hovering right.

11:55.910 --> 12:01.580
So we're going to go here and you know what I'm kind of getting tired of nothings not seeing anything

12:01.580 --> 12:01.750
right.

12:01.780 --> 12:05.160
So this is going to move this one so we can see actually what's happening right.

12:05.340 --> 12:10.050
And then just remind me actually to change this one so it's actually working right.

12:10.200 --> 12:17.100
And then over here we're going to say for back text button text or hear button and we're going to say

12:17.100 --> 12:21.400
hover and what should happen as we're hovering right.

12:21.420 --> 12:25.240
So we're going to set the rules as we're doing.

12:25.440 --> 12:32.490
So we're going to make it over here we're going to set back on color ground color and we're going to

12:32.490 --> 12:37.810
say this is going to be again this is going to be e Six Day.

12:38.210 --> 12:46.470
And after we have to be ready then we're going to have a caller and the caller is going to be 1 9 1

12:46.470 --> 12:50.180
6 1 7 1 7 1 6.

12:50.580 --> 12:55.220
And then we want for the white button red because the white button is going to be a little bit different

12:55.230 --> 12:57.060
because you can see that it's not going to look as good.

12:57.060 --> 12:57.510
Right.

12:57.660 --> 12:58.750
If it stays in sync.

12:58.770 --> 12:59.230
Right.

12:59.400 --> 13:06.370
So here we're going to say this is going to be service white button or service we're here and I'm here

13:06.780 --> 13:14.080
white and they're We're going to say button on your hover right.

13:14.130 --> 13:17.580
So as we're hovering what should happen let's check it out.

13:17.610 --> 13:22.620
First thing is going to be background and background and actually going to say it's going to be 1 9

13:22.620 --> 13:24.380
1 7 1 6.

13:24.390 --> 13:24.830
Right.

13:24.850 --> 13:26.510
And the background is going to be like this.

13:26.730 --> 13:34.550
Then we have a border and we're going to say border color and you know what actually went ahead I didn't

13:34.550 --> 13:36.080
need for a hovering right.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.590
So we actually in a different read.

13:38.590 --> 13:40.650
So first we needed for the button.

13:40.880 --> 13:46.340
So I apologize for this and we needed a background yellow light on this one.

13:46.430 --> 13:47.420
So we're going to go over here.

13:47.420 --> 13:51.360
We're going to say this is going to be six.

13:51.680 --> 13:58.340
And then I'm going to have a half to the writing this is going to be the white one and or here we're

13:58.340 --> 13:59.740
going to have a color of black.

13:59.750 --> 14:00.490
Right.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.640
So we're going to go with color.

14:02.690 --> 14:05.680
I don't know I'm going to say because I'm going to one mine.

14:06.190 --> 14:07.370
I'm sorry hashtag.

14:07.390 --> 14:07.600
Right.

14:07.610 --> 14:15.120
So first it was hashtag I'm going to say 1 9 1 7 1 6 7 1 6.

14:15.120 --> 14:15.380
All right.

14:15.380 --> 14:20.110
So then we have black text and then we want a hovering effect right.

14:20.300 --> 14:24.460
So now we can just copy this guy over here.

14:24.570 --> 14:25.880
Copy this one.

14:25.880 --> 14:31.520
And I actually said it over here copy and pasted and we're going to say however we're going to say how

14:31.520 --> 14:34.430
ever and what would shouldn't happen or here.

14:34.610 --> 14:36.130
It should be background.

14:36.410 --> 14:36.710
Right.

14:36.820 --> 14:43.550
And now the background is going to 1 9 1 7 1 6 and we're going to have a border color which is also

14:43.550 --> 14:44.900
going to be the same thing.

14:45.050 --> 14:52.820
So we can just copy this one over here and copy this guy copy and paste and then we're going to have

14:52.880 --> 14:58.380
a color right and the color is going to be in again it's going to be six eight.

14:58.670 --> 15:02.460
And they're all going to have to have be.

15:02.770 --> 15:06.190
So we'll have this one over here to check it out right as we're going.

15:06.260 --> 15:08.290
You can see what's happening right.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.250
We have a color.

15:11.390 --> 15:11.840
Right.

15:11.990 --> 15:13.030
But maybe over here.

15:13.040 --> 15:18.650
I don't know whether we would want all this border not background color actually border color.

15:18.650 --> 15:25.820
This one is border color right so if we go back over here you can see that it should look like this.

15:25.820 --> 15:26.500
Right.

15:26.570 --> 15:32.240
And then we have for the Frontex right when we have those two rules that actually make all the magic

15:32.240 --> 15:33.020
happen right.

15:33.020 --> 15:37.910
So here let's remember again this negative 50 even.

15:38.090 --> 15:38.460
Right.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.110
So it's high time again right.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.870
And now let's actually set the rules the day will appear.

15:42.860 --> 15:43.330
All right.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.640
So we're here we're going to write server side.

15:45.640 --> 15:51.010
I'm so serious and I'm not going to say hover.

15:51.020 --> 15:54.280
And so as we're hovering over server side and what should happen right.

15:54.320 --> 16:03.080
So we're going to have a front here text and we're going to have a transform property right.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.510
And we're going to say this is going to be translate.

16:05.750 --> 16:06.230
Translate.

16:06.230 --> 16:11.530
Why and we're going to say this is going to be negative 200 pixels on this.

16:11.630 --> 16:12.230
Right.

16:12.500 --> 16:20.510
So I'm just going to say this guy or here we're going to say Cirus right here I had I'm going to say

16:20.510 --> 16:27.010
again how were and what's going to happen to the back text like some black text on here and what we're

16:27.020 --> 16:32.640
going to do is bottom her bottom bottom zero.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.290
So I would say this one.

16:34.670 --> 16:37.580
Let's go to the big screen is going to look probably better.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.930
Right refresh.

16:39.030 --> 16:42.050
Right now I can see I haven't set up the grid yet.

16:42.330 --> 16:43.870
But just for hovering right.

16:44.030 --> 16:45.060
This is how we do it.

16:45.060 --> 16:45.800
All right.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.500
So just remember those two things right.

16:48.500 --> 16:49.580
First we have all here.

16:49.580 --> 16:51.000
This was the resolution.

16:51.020 --> 16:51.550
Right.

16:51.830 --> 16:55.860
And first this was the setup right for the back and Frontex right.

16:55.910 --> 16:56.790
You can see or hear.

16:56.840 --> 16:57.080
Right.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.930
So this one was for the back text.

16:58.930 --> 16:59.460
Right.

16:59.510 --> 17:04.410
And this was for the Frontex from Texas obviously was much more shoulder.

17:04.430 --> 17:04.670
Right.

17:04.670 --> 17:10.380
We just did a transform and then we added two seconds and then we did the transform translate.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.040
Why.

17:11.060 --> 17:11.840
Right.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.490
And we're here for a transition.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.460
This was a little bit more because we first had to hide it.

17:16.460 --> 17:19.750
Right so position absolute and bottom line is negative.

17:19.790 --> 17:20.330
Right.

17:20.330 --> 17:24.470
And obviously these rallies can differ of what you have inside or here right.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.710
But this is the general sense of pride.

17:27.740 --> 17:32.870
First we hide it and then we go back over here and then we resolve this right.

17:32.930 --> 17:36.580
And the last thing that we actually have is media.

17:36.720 --> 17:36.950
Right.

17:36.980 --> 17:39.350
So this is for Responsive skree.

17:39.620 --> 17:43.790
So if we go back over here I was going to create a little bit more room because there's going to be

17:43.790 --> 17:44.970
a little bit longer.

17:45.150 --> 17:51.410
I'm going to say we're here in media and we're going to say screen are here like this and right here

17:51.440 --> 17:58.220
we're going to write mean with we're here we're going to say this is going to be 776.

17:58.260 --> 18:06.920
And so this is going to be for the medium 7 7 7 7 6 pixels wide over here and we're going to have brackets

18:07.340 --> 18:15.080
and then we're going to say that this is going to be a services container or here we're going to write

18:15.180 --> 18:19.520
this is going to be this play and we're going to say grade right.

18:19.610 --> 18:22.440
So we would want first them to be in this.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.330
And then there's going to be and other things that are going on.

18:25.340 --> 18:26.000
Right.

18:26.030 --> 18:35.830
When you say grade template or here play columns like this maybe let's get rid of this guy or your grade

18:36.580 --> 18:42.010
template columns template columns and we're going to say this is going to be one.

18:42.130 --> 18:44.730
Fraction one fraction right.

18:44.770 --> 18:46.720
So are here two fractions.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.730
And then now we would actually want to change the water.

18:49.970 --> 18:50.430
Right.

18:50.650 --> 18:53.470
So remember how these things look like this.

18:53.470 --> 18:54.120
Right.

18:54.370 --> 18:59.500
And if we actually say this and go back right you'll see that it's not going to look the way we want

18:59.560 --> 19:00.120
right.

19:00.130 --> 19:01.840
So this is going to look like this right.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.450
So obviously we need to change the order of these guys right.

19:04.450 --> 19:07.790
We're here just flip this one to the left.

19:07.820 --> 19:08.380
All right.

19:08.410 --> 19:13.720
So what we're going to do here we're going to write services here.

19:13.750 --> 19:16.840
Container container.

19:17.080 --> 19:25.690
And we're going to say this is going to be a service item item class and we're going to have a nth child

19:25.970 --> 19:28.270
and we're going to say this is one.

19:28.420 --> 19:37.350
Right and of and child of type 1 or you can say of type and we're going to say one.

19:37.460 --> 19:40.340
And so what does this one say one.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.660
And what should happen for the first one.

19:42.680 --> 19:46.940
What is going to say this is going to be more than one murder.

19:47.120 --> 19:51.780
One more here and now we're going to copy and paste this and just change around three and four one two

19:51.840 --> 19:52.660
three.

19:52.750 --> 19:53.190
Right.

19:53.380 --> 19:59.020
And this is going to be honest with the child number two the child number two is going to stay the three

19:59.020 --> 20:04.540
actually is going to become a 4 and the four is going to become three.

20:04.580 --> 20:04.920
Right.

20:05.050 --> 20:08.210
And this was it for this lovely CSSA.

20:08.410 --> 20:14.920
So we go back refresh and you can see that something went wrong because that's not how we wanted.

20:14.920 --> 20:15.550
Right.

20:15.550 --> 20:21.290
So let's check it out again where something must of maybe stop somewhere right.

20:21.340 --> 20:22.720
So services container.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.360
This is one two three four.

20:24.610 --> 20:25.860
And this is three four.

20:25.870 --> 20:26.290
Right.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.060
And this is actually not three.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.870
This is actually needs to be four.

20:30.080 --> 20:30.700
Right.

20:30.730 --> 20:34.290
So we saved this one over here and let's try it again.

20:34.390 --> 20:34.640
Right.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.610
And sure enough now works right.

20:36.610 --> 20:42.080
So now this is how we can create or hear the services section and now we really want to.
