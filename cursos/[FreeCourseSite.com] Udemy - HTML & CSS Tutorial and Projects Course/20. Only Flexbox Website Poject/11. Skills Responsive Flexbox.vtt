WEBVTT

00:00.110 --> 00:05.250
This again let's look at why you need the media equerries right because everything looks very nice or

00:05.250 --> 00:06.110
here right.

00:06.120 --> 00:11.670
However if we go to a bigger screen like the one we're actually opening with our browser here right

00:11.940 --> 00:15.060
not the left preview right you can see that we have skills.

00:15.080 --> 00:20.890
However the problem is here as you can see that as I make my screen bigger right it stays the same.

00:20.880 --> 00:21.120
Right.

00:21.150 --> 00:23.870
Because we start it again with a mobile design.

00:23.870 --> 00:24.490
Right.

00:24.540 --> 00:28.600
So this wouldn't be looking like this on a bigger screen right.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.500
And this is not something that we would want.

00:30.510 --> 00:30.900
Right.

00:31.050 --> 00:35.030
We always leave with one some kind of columns right next to each other right.

00:35.130 --> 00:38.580
And we're going to be using media queries in fluxbox for that.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.690
So we're going to do more here.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.040
We're going to write and this is going to be media equerry.

00:43.410 --> 00:51.240
So I'm going to say media and I'm going to say media and we're going to see screen here and then we're

00:51.240 --> 01:00.000
going to say on an on here I'm going to say men with here like this with I don't want to say 576 pixels.

01:00.030 --> 01:03.930
And again this is an arbitrary value you can use whatever you want.

01:04.020 --> 01:07.610
However this 576 is for the bootstrap small screen.

01:07.620 --> 01:08.040
Right.

01:08.190 --> 01:09.860
So that's why I'm using this.

01:09.880 --> 01:10.140
Right.

01:10.140 --> 01:14.110
So this is some kind of value that you can just use as a reference.

01:14.290 --> 01:19.850
No here remember this class skills center right actually wrapped all around articles.

01:20.130 --> 01:24.570
And first thing that I'm going to say is that this should always stay like this right.

01:24.750 --> 01:32.240
I will say this should always have a max with someone to Max with an I'm going to say this is going

01:32.240 --> 01:39.850
to max with 90 you with this or he is then I'm going to say this is going to have Marjan zero.

01:39.860 --> 01:44.580
No no it's always going to place it in the center you know like this.

01:44.610 --> 01:49.010
And then the next thing that I would want to do is actually add some more value.

01:49.050 --> 01:49.640
Right.

01:49.740 --> 01:57.900
So here what I'm going to say is that starting from the screen 576 right now we want to display this

01:58.500 --> 02:01.390
display and I'm going to say flex right.

02:01.420 --> 02:03.510
And let's just check it out how it looks like.

02:03.660 --> 02:07.720
So you can see that there's definitely bigger than 576.

02:07.920 --> 02:08.240
Right.

02:08.250 --> 02:10.670
And if we save it we're here.

02:10.950 --> 02:11.930
Nothing changed.

02:11.940 --> 02:12.480
Right.

02:12.690 --> 02:15.140
And this is interesting because we missed something.

02:15.180 --> 02:20.910
So yeah I think it was skills center right so now for saving this should look different.

02:21.510 --> 02:27.700
And sure enough right now you can see that this actually is right away looking like this right.

02:27.720 --> 02:30.680
So you can see it right away as soon as I refresh the right.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.610
You can see that this is actually in display flex right.

02:33.690 --> 02:40.030
And the way it looks like right this is on one row and you can see that it's using actually 90 viewport.

02:40.150 --> 02:45.270
And if I'm going to go back to smaller screen I can see what happens right now they're all squishing

02:45.270 --> 02:47.030
together Scotian together right.

02:47.190 --> 02:49.360
And this is what you want to fix right.

02:49.380 --> 02:51.420
So starting from 576.

02:51.420 --> 02:52.810
This is what we would have.

02:53.070 --> 02:58.440
So we're going to go back over here and once we have this play flex again we're going to say first right

02:58.470 --> 03:00.120
and this is very important.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.650
When you say justify content and space between.

03:04.020 --> 03:04.550
Right.

03:04.560 --> 03:09.560
Because what we would want we would want them to be actually pushed out as far as they can.

03:09.960 --> 03:15.050
This is very important if you want to working with a flex box you want to actually do the layout.

03:15.090 --> 03:15.620
Right.

03:15.630 --> 03:21.390
So make sure you have a justified content and space between then after that we're going to have flex

03:21.810 --> 03:26.170
when I say wrap and we're going to say or here and they should wrap here.

03:26.210 --> 03:26.790
Right.

03:27.180 --> 03:28.740
So we're going to say flex wrap.

03:28.740 --> 03:33.450
So as the screen actually is going to get smaller actually going to start wrapping.

03:33.610 --> 03:40.380
All right then after that once we have this one to say for each individual skill right we're going to

03:40.380 --> 03:45.620
say like this we're going to say for the class of skill they should flex right.

03:45.660 --> 03:49.820
So they shouldn't grow or here they shouldn't shrink.

03:49.890 --> 03:50.470
Right.

03:50.550 --> 03:54.470
So here you can see that I'm saying 0 for grow and one for shrink.

03:54.480 --> 03:54.970
Right.

03:54.990 --> 04:01.350
So basically I'm saying I don't want them to here grow but I don't want them to shrink either.

04:01.680 --> 04:02.340
Right.

04:02.340 --> 04:08.670
So zero for a grow and one for shrink here and then we're going to have a calque where we're going to

04:08.670 --> 04:10.280
have a base rally.

04:10.470 --> 04:17.880
So calque over here and over here we're going to say this is going to be twenty five or sorry 50 50

04:17.880 --> 04:24.540
percent right because we would have to screen and on here we're going to have a minus like this and

04:24.540 --> 04:29.690
we're going to say to EON's and let me talk through what's happening all right.

04:29.730 --> 04:36.500
So make sure it's very important to have this sign right in between the spaces So basically don't write

04:36.540 --> 04:39.120
like this because then it's not going to work.

04:39.330 --> 04:42.260
So make sure that there are spaces in between like this right.

04:42.280 --> 04:46.110
You can even see that it actually changes the value right.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.760
Change the color.

04:47.820 --> 04:55.560
Now we have 50 percent here and this is two hips and two CMs is actually a gap in between.

04:55.560 --> 05:02.480
All right so here let's go back over here again and we're going to say this here and if we refresh and

05:02.600 --> 05:04.650
I can see what we have right.

05:04.740 --> 05:08.190
So first of all we have two columns side by side.

05:08.210 --> 05:09.080
All right.

05:09.170 --> 05:17.260
So starting from the screen 576 each column or here's 50 percent or right.

05:17.450 --> 05:20.710
And those two IEMs you can see or hear right.

05:20.750 --> 05:23.980
So remember when we had the value space between.

05:24.070 --> 05:24.710
Right.

05:24.710 --> 05:26.920
So remember we're here right.

05:26.960 --> 05:32.060
So we placed them side by side right 90 percent of you you with.

05:32.120 --> 05:36.720
And then replace them as far as way from each other right.

05:36.980 --> 05:39.990
And then we place over here these two teams right.

05:40.010 --> 05:42.610
And again this is the value that you can change if.

05:42.640 --> 05:43.830
You can do something like this.

05:43.830 --> 05:45.230
You can have one team.

05:45.430 --> 05:46.880
So let's refresh.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.270
Sure enough they actually became closer to each other.

05:50.280 --> 05:50.860
Right.

05:50.960 --> 05:54.130
So because we all here only have the gap of one.

05:54.180 --> 05:54.770
All right.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.840
Now here remember this guy right.

05:56.840 --> 06:03.380
So again if this would be one this would grow well we don't want it to grow.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.170
This would be zero.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.610
This actually wouldn't shrink.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.740
Well we actually want it to shrink.

06:09.740 --> 06:10.040
Right.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.550
So here we're going to say one more year like this.

06:13.550 --> 06:19.180
And then the next value who would want his or her base swelling what you're going to use a clock.

06:19.190 --> 06:19.880
All right.

06:19.880 --> 06:26.010
So I'm going to say Coke or here and we're going to say this is going to be 50 percent minus one.

06:26.030 --> 06:26.800
Yeah.

06:27.080 --> 06:32.780
So we're going to go back over here and let's just set some values so let's all go here and I'm going

06:32.780 --> 06:36.630
to say we're here and this is going to be a different media screen.

06:36.750 --> 06:37.200
Right.

06:37.250 --> 06:42.190
So what I can do or here is I can just copy and paste this here.

06:42.320 --> 06:49.740
And for the immediate screen when going to say is media screen medium with an on here let's say 776

06:49.760 --> 06:50.380
right.

06:50.390 --> 06:55.950
So for a bigger screen right all this is going to stay the same and change this value around.

06:56.150 --> 06:59.790
So I'm going to say here I'm going to do this.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.460
I'm going to save this on here.

07:01.730 --> 07:03.890
And instead of 25 percent.

07:03.960 --> 07:04.260
Right.

07:04.270 --> 07:07.610
So instead of 50 they're going to place 25.

07:07.820 --> 07:08.240
Right.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.980
And we can just leave this one here.

07:10.300 --> 07:10.630
Right.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.490
And let's say this and let's see.

07:12.920 --> 07:19.500
What's happening is on here and what I'm saying is for the minimum 576 six should look like this.

07:19.610 --> 07:26.560
Once we go to the bigger screen right to the screen of 776 right should actually change that 25 minus

07:26.570 --> 07:27.320
one.

07:27.590 --> 07:29.340
So we're going to go back over here.

07:29.410 --> 07:34.850
I'm going to refresh on this screen you can see this is going to be 50 percent as I'm actually going

07:34.850 --> 07:36.440
to the bigger screen right.

07:36.470 --> 07:44.090
The moment it hits 776 now we can see how this one looks like right now if we really want right we can

07:44.180 --> 07:46.270
add maybe a little bit of changes right.

07:46.280 --> 07:52.640
First of all maybe you know what let's maybe change from 776 maybe like change the 9 9 to.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.140
For the bigger screen.

07:54.350 --> 07:56.430
Maybe then it's like going to look bigger.

07:56.450 --> 07:57.000
Right.

07:57.050 --> 07:58.250
So we're going to save this.

07:58.400 --> 08:06.140
Still this is going to be 50 and now only when we reach actually or here this nine to right now we actually

08:06.140 --> 08:08.070
have the value right.

08:08.090 --> 08:09.780
That's actually work right.

08:09.950 --> 08:15.090
So here what's happening is if we're going to be actually shrinking it down.

08:15.330 --> 08:15.560
Right.

08:15.620 --> 08:19.650
You can see what happens the moment we actually get to the screen right.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.210
This is how it's going to look like.

08:21.340 --> 08:28.940
And this is how we can work with a responsive media query right in order to make this one look exactly

08:28.940 --> 08:30.480
like the way it looks over here.
