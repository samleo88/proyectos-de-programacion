00:00.600 --> 00:05.330
Fresh after that we have pseudo classes on the first one is gonna be the hover.

00:05.340 --> 00:08.870
Now with the pseudo classes in general the main idea is like this.

00:08.870 --> 00:13.730
So as the element is gonna be changing some kind of state now in a hover.

00:13.740 --> 00:15.240
This is very simple.

00:15.240 --> 00:21.970
So as we're gonna be hovering over the actual element then something is gonna change about that element.

00:21.970 --> 00:27.900
Now again this can be anything with the senses and we can apply this to all the element.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.140
Now later on we're gonna be looking at specifically the length.

00:31.140 --> 00:37.170
So those pseudo glasses are can be specific the links but how are we can use on everything.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.000
And you know what.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.810
Why don't we make an example.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.300
So first let's get to this can save it.

00:42.720 --> 00:47.400
And in the indexation the amount of work and maybe leave the paragraph again just to show that everything

00:47.400 --> 00:48.910
works on all of them.

00:48.960 --> 00:55.110
Let's write maybe a div then div let's add a class just to show that this is going to work when the

00:55.110 --> 00:57.540
classes are just gonna be header.

00:57.630 --> 01:03.360
I don't know we didn't had a rule just gonna have some kind of text as well maybe 10 letters something

01:03.360 --> 01:08.870
like this and then let's add the link now for the link again we're just gonna have a dummy trough meaning

01:08.930 --> 01:16.140
this is not going to link anywhere and here organist gonna say that I don't know this is a link something

01:16.140 --> 01:16.570
like this.

01:16.980 --> 01:19.010
And now let's decide what we're gonna do.

01:19.140 --> 01:24.760
So let's say that for a paragraph I would want as I'm hovering to be a bigger font size.

01:25.150 --> 01:28.490
So I'm going to say paragraph but then here we need to use the hover.

01:28.500 --> 01:33.750
So now we're hovering with this class and this would be the difference between the two dots that we

01:33.750 --> 01:37.320
used previously on pseudo elements and with the classes.

01:37.320 --> 01:42.540
So the class says this is just going to be one set of colon that's all and I'm here I'm gonna say as

01:42.540 --> 01:48.410
I'm hovering I would want the font size to be I don't know 60 pixels on the Barbara what's gonna happen

01:48.470 --> 01:52.460
is we're hovering over doing the mouse then honestly this is gonna be very big.

01:52.470 --> 01:58.800
Now I need to head over back and make this wasn't the best example because this can be triggering over

01:58.800 --> 01:59.180
the place.

01:59.190 --> 02:01.340
So I just change it.

02:01.470 --> 02:02.770
I don't know font.

02:03.060 --> 02:05.930
Let's do the color is always a good.

02:05.970 --> 02:12.840
Gabe can say color and let's say right now as I'm going to be hovering the color of the paragraph is

02:12.840 --> 02:13.770
obviously going to be red.

02:14.190 --> 02:17.470
I also have the class so I can do the same thing with the class.

02:17.580 --> 02:24.110
So let's say for the header we're going to be hovering and we can change the background too.

02:24.300 --> 02:27.900
I don't know Blue as I'm hovering over and notice what happens.

02:27.980 --> 02:31.890
Also we're not limited to again one property with one value.

02:32.960 --> 02:37.520
We can write that color is gonna be white here and yeah whatever CSO styles we would want to.

02:38.130 --> 02:44.160
And let's say as I'm hovering enough I have the background that is going to be blue and the color is

02:44.160 --> 02:45.100
gonna be white.

02:45.100 --> 02:47.580
Now last but not least I do have the link.

02:47.580 --> 02:50.560
So let's say for the link there's gonna be again however.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.960
So as I'm hovering over Darling what should happen.

02:53.010 --> 02:56.070
I don't know I'm going to say text decoration is gonna be none.

02:56.230 --> 02:57.570
So only as I'm hovering.

02:57.570 --> 02:59.740
Then the underline is gonna disappear.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.340
Now what happens as I'm hovering over the link.

03:02.490 --> 03:03.710
I have no underline.

03:03.750 --> 03:07.220
So that's how we can work would have our pseudo class in the CSF.
