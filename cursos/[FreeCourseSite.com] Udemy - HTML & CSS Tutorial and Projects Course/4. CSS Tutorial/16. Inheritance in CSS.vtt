Once we have covered Dave now let's talk about the inheritance in CSX.

00:05.740 --> 00:07.630
Now please don't be scared of this word.

00:07.910 --> 00:10.150
It's not as scary as it seems.

00:10.210 --> 00:16.450
It basically operates on the principle that whatever styles will gonna be adding for the parent element

00:16.810 --> 00:23.440
in the age the smell the children all month are gonna be inherited unless we specifically style the

00:23.530 --> 00:24.920
children element.

00:24.940 --> 00:27.460
As always I think it's going to be much more easier.

00:27.640 --> 00:28.370
Go over it.

00:28.470 --> 00:30.110
We have the actual code.

00:30.190 --> 00:35.680
First of all make it out of styles that I have here and let's also delete everything that we had so

00:35.680 --> 00:37.680
far in the previous lesson.

00:37.810 --> 00:42.990
So I'm gonna start very simply by working with paragraphs so I'm gonna say there's gonna be two paragraphs

00:43.030 --> 00:45.180
each of them I don't not in words.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.620
So let's do it this way.

00:46.630 --> 00:50.770
I'm going to select them both and I'm going to say you know what.

00:50.770 --> 00:54.420
The first and the second one is just gonna be part of the nugget.

00:54.670 --> 00:55.970
So far so good.

00:55.990 --> 00:59.590
Now I'm gonna head over back to style C assess.

00:59.650 --> 01:04.200
Notice that if I'm gonna style the body and let's add the color red.

01:04.210 --> 01:05.320
What's gonna happen.

01:05.410 --> 01:07.330
Both paragraphs are gonna turn red.

01:07.690 --> 01:09.610
Now why is this happening.

01:09.610 --> 01:15.160
Well you see if we're looking at the body anyone we should already know that body element at the moment

01:15.160 --> 01:21.820
has two children and both of them are paragraph in paragraph number one and paragraph number two.

01:21.940 --> 01:29.020
And what happens is if we're going to add styles to a parent element the children are going to inherit

01:29.020 --> 01:29.810
them.

01:29.890 --> 01:35.400
So as we're styling the body we're ultimately also styling right now the parent.

01:35.440 --> 01:40.690
Now if I'm gonna head over back and let's say that there is gonna be a div and now these two paragraphs

01:40.720 --> 01:47.440
are gonna be sitting within dev and let's start out so I'm gonna copy and paste them for now all of

01:47.440 --> 01:48.640
them are styled the same way.

01:48.670 --> 01:54.760
However if we're gonna say uh that div is gonna have a color of red.

01:54.820 --> 01:55.990
Check this out.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.620
So I'm sorry not red.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.100
Little something different.

01:59.470 --> 02:01.650
Now both paragraphs are blue.

02:01.660 --> 02:03.130
Now why is this happening.

02:03.190 --> 02:08.330
Because even though the div is still the child the body.

02:08.500 --> 02:13.350
Now we specifically say okay for this div there's gonna be a separate star.

02:13.450 --> 02:18.440
So instead of just inheriting everything from body we specifically say okay.

02:18.490 --> 02:20.740
So for day we're gonna have color blue.

02:20.740 --> 02:24.460
So now both paragraphs are actually inheriting from the day.

02:24.880 --> 02:27.590
So in general this is how the inheritance would work.

02:28.200 --> 02:34.420
However if I'm gonna head over and if I'm gonna say that I also like to place a I don't know heading

02:34.420 --> 02:42.280
to and I'm going to say I am hearing and if within the C assess we're gonna have a specific style here

02:42.280 --> 02:43.340
for heading to.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.680
And again this could be a D.

02:44.680 --> 02:49.750
This could be class this could be a simple element selector please understand that there would be no

02:49.750 --> 02:50.490
difference.

02:50.650 --> 02:54.160
And for our case we're just gonna use a simple element like there.

02:54.340 --> 02:59.940
And if we're going then again add a color of green not this notice something interesting.

02:59.950 --> 03:04.010
So now the heading is going to be having only the color of green.

03:04.030 --> 03:09.940
So what I'm trying to explain to you the inheritance is going to work unless you're adding a specific

03:09.940 --> 03:12.250
style for that particular element.

03:12.650 --> 03:19.780
However if something is gonna be sitting here as a child element it will gonna be inherited from the

03:19.780 --> 03:24.190
parent element as you're applying styles to a parent element.
