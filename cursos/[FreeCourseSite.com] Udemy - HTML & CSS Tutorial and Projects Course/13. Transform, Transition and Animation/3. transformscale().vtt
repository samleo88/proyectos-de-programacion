00:00.550 --> 00:01.240
Next one up.

00:01.240 --> 00:02.420
We have the scale.

00:02.470 --> 00:05.630
And you'll notice the a lot of things that we already have.

00:05.860 --> 00:09.700
We translate is going to be very relatable to the scale.

00:09.700 --> 00:13.750
Now let's start maybe with the red one and let's use transform.

00:13.810 --> 00:19.480
And then we're gonna set it equal not to translate but we're gonna use the scale now scale again is

00:19.480 --> 00:26.420
gonna have few options we can have these Scale X and we have scale y as well as we have scale so that

00:26.420 --> 00:30.800
we can enter both values for the x 1 and the y 1.

00:30.910 --> 00:36.820
Now with the X what's gonna happen is that if we're gonna go past the value of 1 in the x direction

00:37.420 --> 00:39.600
the element is gonna grow the x direction.

00:39.640 --> 00:45.520
So let's say if I'm gonna say to then the element is gonna get twice as big in the x direction.

00:45.580 --> 00:49.100
Notice it happens on the right hand side and on the left hand side.

00:49.220 --> 00:51.400
How or if I'm going to go less than 1.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.190
So let's say zero point one.

00:53.320 --> 00:59.570
Now the element is gonna be half the size but the trimming is gonna happen on both sides.

00:59.860 --> 01:04.360
So not only let's say on one side but the trimming is gonna happen on the left hand side and the right

01:04.360 --> 01:04.690
hand side.

01:05.110 --> 01:11.180
So now this is gonna be half the size of the previous element that will be the x direction.

01:11.230 --> 01:13.940
Obviously we can do the same thing in the y direction.

01:14.110 --> 01:20.870
So let me just copy this and let's say for the number two number green one instead of X we're going

01:20.870 --> 01:22.340
to place y.

01:22.360 --> 01:23.650
Notice what happens.

01:23.660 --> 01:28.600
So now the element is gonna be half the size in the y direction you want it twice as big.

01:28.600 --> 01:32.310
And again I'm just using the round values you can do something like this.

01:32.350 --> 01:37.810
So obviously this is just gonna grow a little bit more than the normal one but I'm just using to just

01:37.810 --> 01:40.720
so you can see that for sure and the element is growing.

01:40.900 --> 01:46.150
Okay so that would be the y direction and self-explanatory we can use both values.

01:46.210 --> 01:51.970
So if I'm going to use the same thing here and if I'm going to copy the transformation let's say we're

01:51.970 --> 01:57.700
going to add the new one then this is gonna be scale and I would like to I don't know zoom it or I'm

01:57.700 --> 02:01.950
sorry not zoom it make it smaller x direction and y direction.

02:02.110 --> 02:04.010
This is the only thing we need to do.

02:04.090 --> 02:10.810
So now what happens is that this element is half the size X direction as well as y direction.

02:10.830 --> 02:17.320
Now I wanted to make it bigger can make it one point five as well as here and now actually the element

02:17.380 --> 02:20.500
is going to be bigger x direction and y direction.

02:20.650 --> 02:27.250
Very very straightforward if you ever need to increase the size of the Element X or Y direction you

02:27.250 --> 02:28.300
can just use scale.
