00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,740
Alright guys so let's talk about keyword
arguments. In the last video we found out

2

00:00:04,740  -->  00:00:10,170
how we can pass only one parameter into
a function if we have the other one set

3

00:00:10,170  -->  00:00:14,969
up with the default value. So, this will
allow us to pass the first argument only

4

00:00:14,969  -->  00:00:21,960
there's going to be no way to omit this
and pass the age, so let's do this.

5

00:00:22,710  -->  00:00:29,939
Let's run it and it's going to say my name
is 27 and my age unknown. Now there is

6

00:00:29,939  -->  00:00:36,149
another keyword in Python called "none"
just like this, this would be a boolean

7

00:00:36,149  -->  00:00:40,110
I guess or just a keyword in general,

8

00:00:40,110  -->  00:00:45,780
basically this is the equivalent to null
in other languages. So we're going to

9

00:00:45,780  -->  00:00:51,690
save this and run this again, and it's going to say my name is none and my age 27.

10

00:00:51,690  -->  00:00:57,390
There's literally no way to only pass in
an argument that is not the first

11

00:00:57,390  -->  00:01:05,519
argument unless you use keyword
arguments, and that is defining what

12

00:01:05,519  -->  00:01:14,729
variable this is supposed to be. So if we
do this and hit run we're going to see

13

00:01:14,729  -->  00:01:20,100
that my name is someone, because we
didn't define a name, and my age is 27. Now

14

00:01:20,100  -->  00:01:25,530
we can also use this capacity and
parameters in different orders. So I can

15

00:01:25,530  -->  00:01:32,159
say name "name=Nick" there let's save that and run it and you'll see that the order

16

00:01:32,159  -->  00:01:35,670
we're passing it in it should if we
weren't using keyword arguments would

17

00:01:35,670  -->  00:01:43,350
say my name is 27, and my age is Nick. So, by using keyword arguments we can

18

00:01:43,350  -->  00:01:48,869
specify which value is supposed to go
into which variable, when it goes into

19

00:01:48,869  -->  00:01:54,390
the function. So that was actually pretty
quick. That's keyword arguments and how

20

00:01:54,390  -->  00:01:55,110
to use them.

21

00:01:55,110  -->  00:02:02,640
I kind of like the sister concept of
default arguments. So in the next video

22

00:02:02,640  -->  00:02:06,240
we're going to be talking about an
infinite number of arguments.
