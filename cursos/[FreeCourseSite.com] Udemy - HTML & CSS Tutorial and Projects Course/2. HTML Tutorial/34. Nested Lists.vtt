00:00.450 --> 00:03.690
We also have an option of creating the nested list.

00:03.760 --> 00:09.170
So let me again delete the word list first and let's create a new one on our list.

00:09.210 --> 00:12.060
But again it would work exactly the same way with both of them.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.860
So again the syntax was you well.

00:14.970 --> 00:18.060
And then within the unknown list we have the list item.

00:18.270 --> 00:20.770
And again let's start first with John.

00:20.940 --> 00:22.430
Then copy and paste it.

00:22.500 --> 00:25.620
And the second one is gonna be peter and sarah.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.140
So our simple on our list.

00:28.260 --> 00:29.250
And Sarah.

00:29.250 --> 00:34.380
But let's say that we would like to add some more specific information about Peter and in our case the

00:34.380 --> 00:39.000
fact that he already knows h the amount CSF now within the list item.

00:39.340 --> 00:44.820
So within the list item WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE OUR NEXT LIST we will gonna create either on our

00:44.820 --> 00:46.440
list or list.

00:46.500 --> 00:50.470
So in our case let's switch it up a little bit and have it as a order list.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.220
And again we're gonna have a list item in our case.

00:53.220 --> 00:57.580
Let's say first one is gonna be email and let's copy and paste it.

00:57.660 --> 00:59.660
And the second one is going to be the CSF.

01:00.240 --> 01:04.300
So the moment will gonna save our HCM document.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.910
We all gonna have John.

01:05.940 --> 01:13.590
Then the Peter's gonna have already arrested list where not only he has a list item with just a name.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.930
We're also going to have our order list within this list.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.410
And this is how this is gonna be displayed.

01:19.830 --> 01:23.130
And again you can get really creative with that if you'd like.

01:23.130 --> 01:26.010
But just to let you know that this would also be your option.
