00:00.210 --> 00:05.530
Next we're going to cover two of your favorite properties as far as flex box is concerned.

00:05.850 --> 00:09.300
When i say favorite moment you're going to start working on the Flex box.

00:09.300 --> 00:15.030
Trust me you'll going to find them very very useful because they're gonna make your lives much much

00:15.030 --> 00:16.040
more easier.

00:16.060 --> 00:21.840
No one is going to be responsible for horizontal alignment and the other one for vertical alignment

00:22.120 --> 00:23.280
not vertical alignment.

00:23.280 --> 00:29.130
We're going to cover next video and we're going to start with justify content that is responsible for

00:29.370 --> 00:30.750
horizontal alignment.

00:30.750 --> 00:36.230
Now first and foremost I'm going to comment all these generic ones.

00:36.270 --> 00:40.450
You know what maybe I'm gonna change my mind later on and we're gonna demo again.

00:40.530 --> 00:42.570
That's the reason why I'm not deleting them.

00:42.570 --> 00:44.290
I'm just coming thing the mouth.

00:44.340 --> 00:48.020
Just please understand that we still have our boxes and nothing didn't change.

00:48.030 --> 00:53.120
But I like I said maybe I'm going to need these generator boxes so I'm gonna leave them comment and

00:53.120 --> 00:55.400
out instead of deleting them.

00:55.680 --> 01:01.130
No like I said justified content is responsible for horizontal line.

01:01.140 --> 01:04.780
Now again we do have the Flex start.

01:04.890 --> 01:11.970
That is the default one and that's the reason when we set up display Fox while the boxes here are sitting

01:12.030 --> 01:13.050
on the left hand side.

01:13.350 --> 01:13.610
All right.

01:13.920 --> 01:20.750
So if I'm going to do again justify content we're going to start with Flex start.

01:20.850 --> 01:26.610
Notice nothing changes in our layout because again that is the default behavior.

01:26.610 --> 01:34.710
However if we're going to in fact copy and paste that and change it to the Flex and our boxes in fact

01:34.770 --> 01:36.980
are shifted to the right hand side.

01:37.020 --> 01:43.650
Now notice when we used a roll reverse not only we shifted them to the other side to the right hand

01:43.650 --> 01:50.430
side we also flip the ordering correct because one was here and then five was all the way here.

01:50.490 --> 01:55.560
In this case when we're using the Flex and we're only dealing with horizontal line.

01:56.070 --> 02:02.100
So in this case when we have flex start the default one while they were sitting on the left hand side.

02:02.520 --> 02:05.240
Now we shifted them all the way to the right hand side.

02:05.700 --> 02:07.750
So that's the purpose of flex.

02:08.140 --> 02:13.480
And then we have three of them that are dealing with distributing them evenly.

02:13.500 --> 02:17.410
Now when we say evenly there are some caveats to that.

02:17.550 --> 02:19.940
So we're going to cover them one by one.

02:19.950 --> 02:22.760
Let's start first with space between.

02:22.950 --> 02:24.660
So let's write justified content.

02:24.790 --> 02:32.400
And I could have copy and paste it but I guess we can also type it out and let's say space between like

02:32.400 --> 02:39.030
so now what happens with space between the first item and the last item regardless of how many items

02:39.030 --> 02:39.710
you have.

02:39.750 --> 02:44.180
Now I guess we have five but again same would work if we had two of them.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.860
Moreover we have 60 of them.

02:45.900 --> 02:53.380
So the first item is going to sit all the way to the edge of the container as well as the last one is

02:53.400 --> 02:59.760
gonna be on the other side of the container all the way up to the edge of the container.

03:00.060 --> 03:04.290
Then there's going to be space in between the items like so.

03:04.420 --> 03:10.590
Okay just keep this one in mind because next one we have a space around where we're gonna have some

03:10.590 --> 03:12.370
margins.

03:12.540 --> 03:19.440
Again let's copy and paste it instead of space between let's look at space around and as far as space

03:19.530 --> 03:26.130
around is concerned we are adding the margins that are in between the items.

03:26.130 --> 03:32.760
So notice we have the double margin between the item 1 and 2 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 because we are

03:32.820 --> 03:35.790
adding here to a margin on the edge.

03:35.790 --> 03:42.360
So the first item is going to have the left margin as well as of course marching in between them like

03:42.360 --> 03:43.660
we had already before.

03:43.680 --> 03:48.870
That's the reason why we have a double because each of the items has this particular margin as well

03:48.870 --> 03:52.400
as the last item as the margin here on the right hand side.

03:52.800 --> 03:57.600
So they're not flush with the container anymore when we use the space around.

03:57.600 --> 04:06.120
And lastly let's copy and paste that where we have space evenly spaced evenly and in this case the margins

04:06.180 --> 04:07.660
are in fact the same.

04:07.710 --> 04:14.550
So the same margin we're going to have here on the edges and the start edge on the and edge as we would

04:14.550 --> 04:16.450
have in between the items.

04:16.770 --> 04:17.890
So that would be the difference.

04:17.910 --> 04:19.390
And this is really up to you.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.780
This is your preference and you know.

04:21.810 --> 04:23.900
I also didn't mention one thing.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.080
My apologies.

04:25.080 --> 04:29.040
There is also justified content and we can go with the center.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.390
Yeah I will apologize.

04:30.390 --> 04:34.100
There's also this one option which by the way is quite common.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.940
So I don't know why I missed that out.

04:35.940 --> 04:42.170
We also have the center where if we go with a center Well I would just place items in the center.

04:42.220 --> 04:48.140
And please understand that regardless of the screen size the layout is not going to change.

04:48.150 --> 04:54.930
So if I went with the center even if my screen size gets massive still I'm going to sit in the center.

04:55.050 --> 05:00.290
If the screen size is small while they're gonna sit here now again please keep in mind we don't have

05:00.290 --> 05:01.520
the Flex wrap.

05:01.520 --> 05:10.420
So in order to wrap them to a next line remember we had a flex we had to flex wrap and we set it equal

05:10.420 --> 05:11.390
to Europe.

05:11.450 --> 05:13.610
Now in this case we're going to wrap the new line.

05:13.630 --> 05:17.230
And since we have the center and that's the reason why we start a new line.

05:17.530 --> 05:19.980
But still we are using this center.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.540
And as far as space around space between space evenly.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.390
Well again it is your preference.

05:26.420 --> 05:30.160
There's gonna be cases where you'd want to have in fact space between.

05:30.190 --> 05:31.140
So let me comment.

05:31.140 --> 05:36.490
All these space evenly and maybe let me make the screen size bigger just so we can for sure see that.

05:36.520 --> 05:41.290
Of course we have this particular layout where there's gonna be cases where you would want this particular

05:41.290 --> 05:48.820
layer where you're going to want to have your first item and last item sitting flush would edge of the

05:48.820 --> 05:51.620
container and then whatever space in between.

05:51.640 --> 05:56.860
However there's also gonna be times when that's not good enough where you're going to say you're not

05:56.860 --> 06:00.270
what I would want all my items to be distributed evenly.

06:00.640 --> 06:03.240
So that's the time when you're going to go with space evenly.

06:03.310 --> 06:05.170
So there's really no right or wrong.

06:05.260 --> 06:08.010
It's mostly your preference just again.

06:08.050 --> 06:13.600
I'm telling you right away that this will be probably one of your favorite ones.

06:13.660 --> 06:17.190
Maybe online content or a line item sorry.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.610
The one we're going to cover next video maybe that is going to top it off.

06:20.640 --> 06:27.130
But two of these the one that we cover right now and the next video is probably going to be your favorite

06:27.130 --> 06:31.330
ones because they really simplify your layouts.

06:31.450 --> 06:37.330
You just need to remember this one property and some values that you like the most and you're good to

06:37.330 --> 06:37.540
go.
