1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,399
Alright, so we've got just about a

2

00:00:02,399  -->  00:00:05,910
finished role-playing battle game here. A

3

00:00:05,910  -->  00:00:07,500
few more improvements that I want to

4

00:00:07,500  -->  00:00:09,990
make though is first we are going to

5

00:00:09,990  -->  00:00:13,799
need to give the enemy both spells and

6

00:00:13,799  -->  00:00:16,949
items, and secondly right now he only

7

00:00:16,949  -->  00:00:19,619
attacks so we want to be able to add

8

00:00:19,619  -->  00:00:21,810
some sort of conditions in there to make

9

00:00:21,810  -->  00:00:24,180
him seem as though he was artificially

10

00:00:24,180  -->  00:00:26,730
intelligent. Meaning if his hit points

11

00:00:26,730  -->  00:00:29,010
are under 30 let's generate a number

12

00:00:29,010  -->  00:00:33,210
between 1-100, and it's over 60 that means

13

00:00:33,210  -->  00:00:36,120
he'll use potion. Ir if his hitpoints

14

00:00:36,120  -->  00:00:38,820
are less than ten percent you know let's

15

00:00:38,820  -->  00:00:41,129
generate a number between 1-100,

16

00:00:41,129  -->  00:00:44,219
and if it's over 60 he uses the

17

00:00:44,219  -->  00:00:46,079
hipotion, if it's over 40 he uses the

18

00:00:46,079  -->  00:00:48,870
regular potion, etc. So, we need to

19

00:00:48,870  -->  00:00:50,760
determine some of those things and we're

20

00:00:50,760  -->  00:00:52,260
going to be doing that soon as well.

21

00:00:52,260  -->  00:00:54,539
First of all we're going to be extending

22

00:00:54,539  -->  00:00:56,850
this to allow us to add multiple enemies

23

00:00:56,850  -->  00:00:59,190
and then target different enemies when each

24

00:00:59,190  -->  00:01:03,420
person attacks. So, we're going to create

25

00:01:03,420  -->  00:01:09,000
enemy2, it's going be person, and so there's going

26

00:01:09,000  -->  00:01:11,310
to be one main enemy and that's

27

00:01:11,310  -->  00:01:13,530
going to be Magus here. He's gonna be

28

00:01:13,530  -->  00:01:14,820
the strong one as you can see with almost

29

00:01:14,820  -->  00:01:17,070
20,000 hit points, and there's going to

30

00:01:17,070  -->  00:01:21,330
be two smaller enemies which are going to

31

00:01:21,330  -->  00:01:23,280
be henchmen, so they are going to be weaker.

32

00:01:23,280  -->  00:01:28,320
So, we're just going to call them Imp, and

33

00:01:28,320  -->  00:01:29,400
we're going to say they're going to have

34

00:01:29,400  -->  00:01:34,530
about 1,250 hitpoints, their magic points

35

00:01:34,530  -->  00:01:38,189
are going to be 130, their strength I

36

00:01:38,189  -->  00:01:40,650
believe we pass in next is going to be

37

00:01:40,650  -->  00:01:42,420
relatively weak, well

38

00:01:42,420  -->  00:01:47,460
actually, no we want these guys

39

00:01:47,460  -->  00:01:49,710
to be easier to defeat but also cause more

40

00:01:49,710  -->  00:01:52,890
damage. So, we're going to set that to

41

00:01:52,890  -->  00:01:57,240
about 560, what I have no idea what I

42

00:01:57,240  -->  00:01:59,549
just did there I pressed something wrong,

43

00:01:59,549  -->  00:02:02,909
560 and then their defence is going to be a

44

00:02:02,909  -->  00:02:07,050
325, and the defense we're also going to

45

00:02:07,050  -->  00:02:10,080
make important as well because what

46

00:02:10,080  -->  00:02:11,400
we're going to do is we're going to take

47

00:02:11,400  -->  00:02:15,090
the attack, the generated attack damage

48

00:02:15,090  -->  00:02:19,710
and then minus the defense of the person

49

00:02:19,710  -->  00:02:21,240
who they're attacking, and then the

50

00:02:21,240  -->  00:02:28,440
resulting number is how much attack it's going to do.

51

00:02:28,440  -->  00:02:30,840
Enemy3 is just going

52

00:02:30,840  -->  00:02:33,420
to be another Imp witht the exact same stats

53

00:02:33,420  -->  00:02:43,710
here. So, I'm going to name this enemy1, 2,

54

00:02:43,710  -->  00:02:49,160
and 3.

55

00:02:49,160  -->  00:02:51,020
And actually

56

00:02:51,020  -->  00:02:53,120
I'm going to do it different because I'm

57

00:02:53,120  -->  00:02:55,280
going to want just for preference

58

00:02:55,280  -->  00:03:00,860
I don't want Magus then two Imps,

59

00:03:00,860  -->  00:03:02,930
I want Magus to be in the middle, and that's

60

00:03:02,930  -->  00:03:05,390
just you know because I can kind of

61

00:03:05,390  -->  00:03:08,510
see how how it would lay out on a

62

00:03:08,510  -->  00:03:11,000
typical RPG screen in the battle.

63

00:03:11,000  -->  00:03:14,630
So, there's our enemies what we're going

64

00:03:14,630  -->  00:03:16,340
to do is we're going to create another

65

00:03:16,340  -->  00:03:19,790
array here or a list called enemies, and

66

00:03:19,790  -->  00:03:22,970
it's going to be equal to enemy1, enemy2

67

00:03:22,970  -->  00:03:26,030
enemy3.

68

00:03:26,030  -->  00:03:29,870
There we go. So, what we're going to do

69

00:03:29,870  -->  00:03:34,400
down here is see it says enemy.get_enemy_stats

70

00:03:34,400  -->  00:03:38,840
we're going to say for enemy in enemies,

71

00:03:38,840  -->  00:03:44,450
enemy.get_enemy_stats. And then what we're going to

72

00:03:44,450  -->  00:03:45,980
have to do is we're gonna have to print

73

00:03:45,980  -->  00:03:49,250
out so after they choose their attack,

74

00:03:49,250  -->  00:03:53,000
there you know etc. here, we're going to

75

00:03:53,000  -->  00:03:56,510
need to determine who the person is

76

00:03:56,510  -->  00:03:58,640
attacking. So, what we're going to do is

77

00:03:58,640  -->  00:04:00,770
we're going to create a function called

78

00:04:00,770  -->  00:04:07,459
choose target, and actually we will put

79

00:04:07,459  -->  00:04:10,070
that into the player class here, player

80

00:04:10,070  -->  00:04:12,080
choose target and then we're going to

81

00:04:12,080  -->  00:04:16,250
pass him enemies. So, now let's jump over to

82

00:04:16,250  -->  00:04:20,750
our game here, and up with the other

83

00:04:20,750  -->  00:04:24,080
choices like choose item and stuff we're just going

84

00:04:24,080  -->  00:04:26,300
to create another method here called

85

00:04:26,300  -->  00:04:31,550
def choose_target, and we're going to be

86

00:04:31,550  -->  00:04:37,430
accepting enemies as a parameter. So, for

87

00:04:37,430  -->  00:04:43,070
enemy in enemies: we are going to just print

88

00:04:43,070  -->  00:04:45,020
out basically what we have been before.

89

00:04:45,020  -->  00:04:49,669
We need to set an index to 0 so we can count, and

90

00:04:49,669  -->  00:04:50,960
put a number actually it's going to be

91

00:04:50,960  -->  00:04:54,770
1 there. So, for enemy in enemies we're

92

00:04:54,770  -->  00:04:59,720
going to print out

93

00:04:59,720  -->  00:05:03,320
the exact same kind of structure we've

94

00:05:03,320  -->  00:05:06,770
been doing, so it's going to be FAIL and

95

00:05:06,770  -->  00:05:15,650
bcolors, BOLD, 1, 2, 3, 4, TARGET, and then

96

00:05:15,650  -->  00:05:20,900
bcolors.ENDC, and we're going to end the color. And actually

97

00:05:20,900  -->  00:05:23,180
this needs to go above that for

98

00:05:23,180  -->  00:05:24,680
statement otherwise it would print it out

99

00:05:24,680  -->  00:05:29,540
three times, or four however many enemies we

100

00:05:29,540  -->  00:05:31,100
have. Right now we're just setting it up

101

00:05:31,100  -->  00:05:34,040
with three. So, here we're going to print

102

00:05:34,040  -->  00:05:34,940
out

103

00:05:34,940  -->  00:05:41,210
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and then the index number

104

00:05:41,210  -->  00:05:46,460
here plus a dot, and then we're going to

105

00:05:46,460  -->  00:06:03,129
say enemy.name, and that's it.

106

00:06:03,129  -->  00:06:08,080
And then we're going to say i += 1.

107

00:06:08,080  -->  00:06:14,589
So, what we need to return is the enemy

108

00:06:14,589  -->  00:06:16,209
that they have chosen,

109

00:06:16,209  -->  00:06:19,749
so this isn't going to be just a print

110

00:06:19,749  -->  00:06:21,610
and then we capture the index in each

111

00:06:21,610  -->  00:06:24,399
one as like we would have to capture

112

00:06:24,399  -->  00:06:26,229
here and then if they're using magic we

113

00:06:26,229  -->  00:06:27,729
would have to capture the target here,

114

00:06:27,729  -->  00:06:30,550
etc., so what we're going to do is put this into a

115

00:06:30,550  -->  00:06:34,209
variable called enemy, and we're actually

116

00:06:34,209  -->  00:06:36,849
going to return the index number of that

117

00:06:36,849  -->  00:06:40,330
enemy, or the object itself.

118

00:06:40,330  -->  00:06:45,009
Let me see...no, just the index number. So,

119

00:06:45,009  -->  00:06:51,039
we're going to say print choose, and I

120

00:06:51,039  -->  00:06:54,459
believe choose was on four spaces in

121

00:06:54,459  -->  00:06:57,999
yeah four spaces in it says choose, so I'm going

122

00:06:57,999  -->  00:07:04,869
to say choose targets, and then we're

123

00:07:04,869  -->  00:07:07,300
going to put actually that's an input i

124

00:07:07,300  -->  00:07:08,769
believe

125

00:07:08,769  -->  00:07:12,579
yeah that's an input. So, choice

126

00:07:12,579  -->  00:07:19,689
equals input, turn this into an int right

127

00:07:19,689  -->  00:07:24,849
off the bat, negative 1, and then we're

128

00:07:24,849  -->  00:07:28,929
going to return choice. So, this is going

129

00:07:28,929  -->  00:07:30,369
to let's say it's going to print out the

130

00:07:30,369  -->  00:07:32,649
enemies and then we're going to select

131

00:07:32,649  -->  00:07:35,679
the first one which is going to be the

132

00:07:35,679  -->  00:07:38,079
first one in the array, so technically

133

00:07:38,079  -->  00:07:39,939
that should be a zero, so we're reducing

134

00:07:39,939  -->  00:07:43,959
the choice by one so if we input one it's

135

00:07:43,959  -->  00:07:45,789
going to actually become 0 and then it's

136

00:07:45,789  -->  00:07:50,050
going to return that is an integer to this

137

00:07:50,050  -->  00:07:53,829
right here. So, enemy is now going to

138

00:07:53,829  -->  00:07:57,369
be 0 so what we're going to say is

139

00:07:57,369  -->  00:08:03,459
enemies, and then we're going to say the

140

00:08:03,459  -->  00:08:06,819
correct enemy like that. So, we're actually

141

00:08:06,819  -->  00:08:11,400
going to copy this bit

142

00:08:11,400  -->  00:08:16,919
and we're actually going to also print

143

00:08:16,919  -->  00:08:23,910
out which enemy you're attacking here, so

144

00:08:23,910  -->  00:08:33,360
enemies enemy, and then their name.

145

00:08:33,360  -->  00:08:38,789
Yeah, so, we're gonna copy this and then

146

00:08:38,789  -->  00:08:39,960
we're going to bring this down to the

147

00:08:39,960  -->  00:08:42,870
magic as well, so if we choose black

148

00:08:42,870  -->  00:08:44,610
magic we need to then choose the target

149

00:08:44,610  -->  00:08:51,150
here. So, same thing they're going to be

150

00:08:51,150  -->  00:08:54,180
taking magic damage, and then we need to

151

00:08:54,180  -->  00:08:57,690
print out which you attacked. So spell

152

00:08:57,690  -->  00:09:11,410
name does X points of damage to

153

00:09:11,410  -->  00:09:17,019
there, and then if we choose an attack

154

00:09:17,019  -->  00:09:19,990
item we're going to, I think that

155

00:09:19,990  -->  00:09:22,120
looks right, so if we choose an

156

00:09:22,120  -->  00:09:24,069
attack item we're going to need to be

157

00:09:24,069  -->  00:09:31,060
able to choose the enemy as well. So, I

158

00:09:31,060  -->  00:09:33,879
take damage so it's going to take item.prop

159

00:09:33,879  -->  00:09:38,500
as the damage, that's the value of

160

00:09:38,500  -->  00:09:40,180
the item, so for instance if we choose a

161

00:09:40,180  -->  00:09:43,209
grenade the grenade's prop property is

162

00:09:43,209  -->  00:09:46,660
going to be equal to 500 i believe. So,

163

00:09:46,660  -->  00:09:48,699
we're going to say item name deals

164

00:09:48,699  -->  00:09:57,310
points of damage to enemies(enemy).name.

165

00:09:57,310  -->  00:10:01,600
Now this should work and we're

166

00:10:01,600  -->  00:10:03,579
gonna test it out here, we should be able

167

00:10:03,579  -->  00:10:05,649
to choose targets, so

168

00:10:05,649  -->  00:10:08,110
let's go ahead and save. Now still the

169

00:10:08,110  -->  00:10:10,930
enemy is not going to be able to attack

170

00:10:10,930  -->  00:10:15,129
us so what we need to do first is we're

171

00:10:15,129  -->  00:10:17,620
going to say enemy0 is going to be

172

00:10:17,620  -->  00:10:23,139
the one who attacks us. So, let's go ahead

173

00:10:23,139  -->  00:10:25,959
and save, run this, and then we're going

174

00:10:25,959  -->  00:10:28,149
to extend that to make each enemy attack

175

00:10:28,149  -->  00:10:30,069
us. So we actually need to fix the names

176

00:10:30,069  -->  00:10:34,329
well those should go in two spaces is

177

00:10:34,329  -->  00:10:40,060
it, yep two, because it's twwo characters less. So,

178

00:10:40,060  -->  00:10:45,009
where is that, there we go. I forgot about that.

179

00:10:45,009  -->  00:10:48,550
So, let's refresh, there we go.

180

00:10:48,550  -->  00:10:51,610
So as you can see we've now got two Imps

181

00:10:51,610  -->  00:10:55,779
and a Magus. So if we select attack

182

00:10:55,779  -->  00:10:57,250
we're going to have to choose a target,

183

00:10:57,250  -->  00:11:00,100
so let's choose an Imp.

184

00:11:00,100  -->  00:11:03,550
He's going to use magic, let's use

185

00:11:03,550  -->  00:11:08,379
thunder on Imp, and then robot's going to

186

00:11:08,379  -->  00:11:11,470
attack Imp. Here we get an error,

187

00:11:11,470  -->  00:11:16,809
enemy damage is not subscriptable.

188

00:11:16,809  -->  00:11:18,630
Enemies damage...oh enemies...I

189

00:11:18,630  -->  00:11:27,590
forgot to change that there. Were is that?
