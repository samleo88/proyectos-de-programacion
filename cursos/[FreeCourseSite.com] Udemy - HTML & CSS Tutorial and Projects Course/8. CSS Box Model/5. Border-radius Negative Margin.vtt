00:00.640 --> 00:01.890
Before I let you go.

00:01.930 --> 00:05.570
Well we're still on the subject on CSI as Box model.

00:05.620 --> 00:09.880
I would like to cover one more property as well as one more value.

00:09.880 --> 00:15.080
Now the property name is gonna be border radius and the value is gonna be negative margin.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.210
So how this is gonna work.

00:16.810 --> 00:21.760
Well first and foremost let me just make some changes here because otherwise this is not going to look

00:21.820 --> 00:23.140
as well as I would like to.

00:23.650 --> 00:28.840
So let's say by this time I hope that you already know all these values and properties meaning at least

00:28.840 --> 00:29.980
the basics of them.

00:30.040 --> 00:33.410
So we're going to start deleting them just so have a little bit more room.

00:33.430 --> 00:38.320
And again if you need to go back just go back to the previous video and you can obviously get the source

00:38.320 --> 00:39.110
code.

00:39.220 --> 00:45.130
Now what I have here I have the border but I have the ash and it's only for the bottom so that's not

00:45.130 --> 00:46.470
something I'm interested.

00:46.570 --> 00:50.980
So we had reason to say that I'm going to get rid of all these three and we're going to work with border

00:51.530 --> 00:57.890
let's say five pixels solid and I'm gonna go with something that we can see clearer.

00:57.970 --> 01:02.830
So I'm gonna go black and that's going to be my border as well as I'm gonna get rid of this margin.

01:02.830 --> 01:07.190
So I was just going to leave the default margin for whatever heading one.

01:07.300 --> 01:14.360
Now I'm also gonna make some changes for the paragraph and here we're also gonna do something similar.

01:14.380 --> 01:18.870
We're all gonna get rid of all the margins as well as we're gonna change the color.

01:18.870 --> 01:22.140
So here let's say the color is going to be green.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.330
Maybe this case we're gonna see it a little bit better.

01:25.430 --> 01:27.070
Now what about border radius.

01:27.110 --> 01:27.740
What does it do.

01:28.370 --> 01:33.690
Well with border radius property we can work on the edges of the border.

01:33.800 --> 01:38.720
And I think it's gonna be easier again to show use over the border than we have radius.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.880
And now again we can insert whatever values you would like.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.590
Now in my case let's start with 20 pixels.

01:44.600 --> 01:51.680
So check this out the moment we do that we have right now the border but the edges around that's the

01:51.680 --> 01:53.830
whole point of this border radius.

01:53.840 --> 01:57.660
Now if you want to be really creative we can obviously change the values here.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.840
We can add more and more value.

01:59.870 --> 02:04.300
Now the option though is we can also go and make it totally round.

02:04.490 --> 02:11.540
So let's say in my case we can use border radius and let's set this to 50 percent because we can also

02:11.540 --> 02:12.810
use the percentages.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.950
So I can do something like this and check this out.

02:15.950 --> 02:21.680
Now my paragraph is actually around like this if I'm going with 50 percent now you can obviously go

02:21.680 --> 02:27.400
80 if you want and you can go even more but probably in most cases you are going to be dealing.

02:27.540 --> 02:29.920
Is going to go at 50 percent.

02:30.050 --> 02:33.860
Now we also have an option for negative margin.

02:33.860 --> 02:39.260
So how that is going to work well for now we're looking at it and we see that this would be the default

02:39.260 --> 02:42.290
margin that we're getting from the default browser.

02:42.620 --> 02:47.840
So there's some margin here in the bottom and then there's also some on the top for the pie.

02:48.350 --> 02:50.400
What about if you change all that.

02:50.480 --> 02:56.570
What if you were going to say here Boehner or I'm sorry margin of border and for the margin top for

02:56.570 --> 03:01.410
the paragraph we're going to set margin but this is not going to be a positive value.

03:01.420 --> 03:05.000
Instead I'm gonna go with like negative hundred pixels.

03:05.420 --> 03:06.920
So what's gonna happen here.

03:06.920 --> 03:13.190
Now the moment we served notice that right now our paragraph is sitting actually on the top of our previous

03:13.190 --> 03:14.990
element which was setting one.

03:15.080 --> 03:21.660
And in most cases whenever you want to deal with some kind of layout this might be one of the options.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.460
Now I'm not saying this is going to be the only option you're gonna be using but it's good to be aware

03:25.460 --> 03:27.280
of it because it might come in handy.
