1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,460
Hey guys, welcome back. So before we get

2

00:00:02,460  -->  00:00:04,470
into data visualization there's a

3

00:00:04,470  -->  00:00:06,330
few more things I want to cover with

4

00:00:06,330  -->  00:00:08,309
Qt, and these are just to give you a

5

00:00:08,309  -->  00:00:10,500
basic understanding of just a few more

6

00:00:10,500  -->  00:00:12,450
concepts. And then I would like if you guys

7

00:00:12,450  -->  00:00:15,210
wanted to go explore this further to do

8

00:00:15,210  -->  00:00:18,449
so, you are completely encouraged to do

9

00:00:18,449  -->  00:00:21,510
that. So the first thing I want to

10

00:00:21,510  -->  00:00:25,980
talk about is the developer tools. So,

11

00:00:25,980  -->  00:00:30,480
no, link or web engine based browser is

12

00:00:30,480  -->  00:00:32,489
complete without developer tools. In fact,

13

00:00:32,489  -->  00:00:34,860
no browser is complete without developer

14

00:00:34,860  -->  00:00:37,350
tools. So, if you're not sure what I

15

00:00:37,350  -->  00:00:42,870
mean, if I open up Safari here and let's

16

00:00:42,870  -->  00:00:45,239
just go to Google, and I'm going to hit

17

00:00:45,239  -->  00:00:49,559
command shift i, and it should...

18

00:00:49,559  -->  00:00:58,620
ok, it opened up mail. Anyway, I will go into

19

00:00:58,620  -->  00:01:06,180
developer, can I find it in here?

20

00:01:06,180  -->  00:01:09,119
Show Web Inspector? Is that what I want? That's what they call

21

00:01:09,119  -->  00:01:10,710
it. Alright, this is the developer tools.

22

00:01:10,710  -->  00:01:12,750
It looks different in here than it does

23

00:01:12,750  -->  00:01:19,049
in chrome. Safari uses a rendering

24

00:01:19,049  -->  00:01:22,049
engine called WebKit, whereas chrome has

25

00:01:22,049  -->  00:01:25,259
forked that. Chrome used to use WebKit, they forked

26

00:01:25,259  -->  00:01:27,930
it, and they call it Blink now, and so

27

00:01:27,930  -->  00:01:29,939
that's why these are kind of different.

28

00:01:29,939  -->  00:01:34,049
Safari and chrome used to act a lot in

29

00:01:34,049  -->  00:01:35,790
the same way, but now it's getting

30

00:01:35,790  -->  00:01:37,079
different. So what we're going to do is

31

00:01:37,079  -->  00:01:38,700
enable developer tools, and how we're

32

00:01:38,700  -->  00:01:42,000
going to do that is right here before we

33

00:01:42,000  -->  00:01:47,430
show the application we're going to set

34

00:01:47,430  -->  00:01:51,270
environment variable called os, well

35

00:01:51,270  -->  00:01:52,740
actually this is how we're going to

36

00:01:52,740  -->  00:01:57,540
create the environment variable to tell

37

00:01:57,540  -->  00:02:02,280
Qt that we

38

00:02:02,280  -->  00:02:05,219
want to enable remote debugging, or the

39

00:02:05,219  -->  00:02:08,369
dev tools within our browser. So, all you have

40

00:02:08,369  -->  00:02:12,090
to do is type os.environ, and then the

41

00:02:12,090  -->  00:02:12,880
the environment

42

00:02:12,880  -->  00:02:15,040
variables name. So in this case it's all caps,

43

00:02:15,040  -->  00:02:23,680
QTWEBENGINE_REMOTE_

44

00:02:23,680  -->  00:02:29,410
DEBUGGING, and we need to set

45

00:02:29,410  -->  00:02:33,940
that to a port number, or a full IP

46

00:02:33,940  -->  00:02:36,370
address with a port number. In this

47

00:02:36,370  -->  00:02:38,380
case I'm just going to be using a port

48

00:02:38,380  -->  00:02:40,390
number because that's really all you

49

00:02:40,390  -->  00:02:44,350
need to do. So I'm going to set this to 667,

50

00:02:44,350  -->  00:02:48,430
and then when I start the application at

51

00:02:48,430  -->  00:02:52,180
this point you're not going to notice

52

00:02:52,180  -->  00:02:57,820
any big differences. Let me add a tab

53

00:02:57,820  -->  00:03:04,450
here. We go to facebook.com, and I'm going

54

00:03:04,450  -->  00:03:06,370
to jump over here and I'm going to open

55

00:03:06,370  -->  00:03:08,500
another tab, and then we can

56

00:03:08,500  -->  00:03:10,540
actually go to developer tools by visiting

57

00:03:10,540  -->  00:03:14,410
local host at the port number,

58

00:03:14,410  -->  00:03:25,150
ok. http://localhost:677 from whatever port

59

00:03:25,150  -->  00:03:29,740
we've told to use developer tools on, and

60

00:03:29,740  -->  00:03:32,800
it has rejected it. In order to access the

61

00:03:32,800  -->  00:03:35,290
network, see I have had the same

62

00:03:35,290  -->  00:03:38,550
problem here on...

63

00:03:48,800  -->  00:03:51,080
Alright, I got this same kind

64

00:03:51,080  -->  00:03:54,200
problem on linux when using developer

65

00:03:54,200  -->  00:03:58,190
tools, so I'm really not too sure why.

66

00:03:58,190  -->  00:04:03,170
Let me open up Chrome

67

00:04:03,170  -->  00:04:07,970
and see if I can access the developer

68

00:04:07,970  -->  00:04:23,960
tools for my browser from

69

00:04:23,960  -->  00:04:25,190
Chrome.

70

00:04:25,190  -->  00:04:29,360
Alright, so it can't. On Windows that's all

71

00:04:29,360  -->  00:04:31,040
you have to do, let me search this here...

72

00:04:31,040  -->  00:04:38,690
qt5 developer tools not working.

73

00:04:38,690  -->  00:04:44,780
I'm not sure if there's extra steps that we

74

00:04:44,780  -->  00:04:47,450
need to take. I mean additionally we could also

75

00:04:47,450  -->  00:04:50,000
set the command line argument when we

76

00:04:50,000  -->  00:04:55,010
run our application, or just set the

77

00:04:55,010  -->  00:04:56,450
environment variable. So we're going to

78

00:04:56,450  -->  00:05:02,720
try setting this right here, and then

79

00:05:02,720  -->  00:05:08,990
we're going to echo that variable so that

80

00:05:08,990  -->  00:05:11,030
should work. So I'm gonna go ahead and

81

00:05:11,030  -->  00:05:13,760
close this, and then jump back over to

82

00:05:13,760  -->  00:05:17,390
pycharm and run the app again, maybe it's

83

00:05:17,390  -->  00:05:22,430
gonna work this time. No, alright, so

84

00:05:22,430  -->  00:05:31,790
maybe it's being blocked in mac OS

85

00:05:31,790  -->  00:05:46,100
and Linux which is really strange. I will have to search that and

86

00:05:46,100  -->  00:05:48,800
if I can provide an answer for you.

87

00:05:48,800  -->  00:05:50,540
The second thing I wanted to show you is

88

00:05:50,540  -->  00:05:54,200
how to use a splitter. So what we're

89

00:05:54,200  -->  00:05:58,280
going to do is where we add a tab here,

90

00:05:58,280  -->  00:06:06,230
the top level, so we are going to use

91

00:06:06,230  -->  00:06:08,720
QWidget and QVBoxLayout, but the top level that

92

00:06:08,720  -->  00:06:11,150
we're going to do is actually going to

93

00:06:11,150  -->  00:06:16,280
be a split layout.

94

00:06:16,280  -->  00:06:20,810
So QVbox, that's fine actually,

95

00:06:20,810  -->  00:06:23,270
what we're going to do is down here

96

00:06:23,270  -->  00:06:24,980
where we add the content instead of

97

00:06:24,980  -->  00:06:34,280
doing that we're going to say self.tabs[i]. splitter, or splitview, equals

98

00:06:34,280  -->  00:06:43,760
QSplitter. And I need to import that from

99

00:06:43,760  -->  00:06:44,720
somewhere I guess, so

100

00:06:44,720  -->  00:06:47,540
let's go up here and try and find out

101

00:06:47,540  -->  00:06:49,250
where that would be. I would imagine

102

00:06:49,250  -->  00:06:53,600
that's in widgets, there we go.

103

00:06:53,600  -->  00:07:01,280
So, where is that...alright. So what

104

00:07:01,280  -->  00:07:02,690
we're going to do at this point instead

105

00:07:02,690  -->  00:07:06,950
of adding our content to

106

00:07:06,950  -->  00:07:09,050
the top level, we're going to add our

107

00:07:09,050  -->  00:07:13,340
split view. So, instead of content

108

00:07:13,340  -->  00:07:15,440
splitview, and then when I restart the

109

00:07:15,440  -->  00:07:16,760
application you're going to notice that

110

00:07:16,760  -->  00:07:18,740
you don't see any web pages and that's

111

00:07:18,740  -->  00:07:20,479
because we haven't actually put it in there

112

00:07:20,479  -->  00:07:21,050
yet.

113

00:07:21,050  -->  00:07:23,180
All we've got is a splitview with nothing

114

00:07:23,180  -->  00:07:25,250
inside of it. So what we're going to do

115

00:07:25,250  -->  00:07:28,760
is we're going to add our content to the

116

00:07:28,760  -->  00:07:33,320
splitview, so self.tabs[i].

117

00:07:33,320  -->  00:07:40,010
splitview.addWidget, and we're

118

00:07:40,010  -->  00:07:47,020
going to add self.tabs[i].content.

119

00:07:50,390  -->  00:07:52,130
And now you'll notice that it looks

120

00:07:52,130  -->  00:07:55,670
normal again, but what actually happened

121

00:07:55,670  -->  00:07:57,920
is we've created one more level. So

122

00:07:57,920  -->  00:08:00,620
initially we were just adding a

123

00:08:00,620  -->  00:08:02,900
QWidget, and setting the layout to a QVBox

124

00:08:02,900  -->  00:08:04,490
layout, and then adding one item so it

125

00:08:04,490  -->  00:08:06,380
showed like this. Now what we're doing is

126

00:08:06,380  -->  00:08:07,640
we're adding a QWidget, we're

127

00:08:07,640  -->  00:08:09,890
setting the layout to VBoxLayout, and in

128

00:08:09,890  -->  00:08:12,380
that VBoxLayout we're setting a new

129

00:08:12,380  -->  00:08:14,660
object called QSplitter, and we're

130

00:08:14,660  -->  00:08:16,370
inserting the page into there. So what

131

00:08:16,370  -->  00:08:18,830
we can then do is we can then run this

132

00:08:18,830  -->  00:08:20,990
multiple times, and actually add an

133

00:08:20,990  -->  00:08:23,600
instance, it will add it's own self

134

00:08:23,600  -->  00:08:29,690
again twice here. So, normally you would

135

00:08:29,690  -->  00:08:32,870
add two different objects in there, and I think

136

00:08:32,870  -->  00:08:34,400
we'll have to add two different objects.

137

00:08:34,400  -->  00:08:38,000
Actually, so, I'll say content one and

138

00:08:38,000  -->  00:08:42,050
then we'll go and reconnect content one

139

00:08:42,050  -->  00:08:48,350
here from these two different things. So, there we

140

00:08:48,350  -->  00:08:50,470
go.

141

00:08:53,050  -->  00:08:57,790
Now you can see that I've got two views

142

00:08:57,790  -->  00:08:59,620
here and I can split them, so

143

00:08:59,620  -->  00:09:01,750
this should be interesting, you know, you

144

00:09:01,750  -->  00:09:04,810
could set up devtools here, and you can

145

00:09:04,810  -->  00:09:07,540
change it from horizontal, or vertical

146

00:09:07,540  -->  00:09:09,730
to horizontal as well, and all you're

147

00:09:09,730  -->  00:09:11,019
going to do for that is you're going to

148

00:09:11,019  -->  00:09:13,660
set the splitter. So, self.tabs[i].

149

00:09:13,660  -->  00:09:20,470
splitview.setOrientation, and

150

00:09:20,470  -->  00:09:24,730
it's going to be Qt.Vertical. It's

151

00:09:24,730  -->  00:09:26,019
going to be an orientation, so either

152

00:09:26,019  -->  00:09:29,380
horizontal or vertical, and when I

153

00:09:29,380  -->  00:09:32,410
run the application again you're going

154

00:09:32,410  -->  00:09:36,190
to see that I've now got a vertical view

155

00:09:36,190  -->  00:09:41,709
here rather than a horizontal

156

00:09:41,709  -->  00:09:44,110
view. And so that's how you can use

157

00:09:44,110  -->  00:09:45,490
QSplitter, and you can use this in a lot

158

00:09:45,490  -->  00:09:46,779
of interesting ways. You can actually

159

00:09:46,779  -->  00:09:49,839
modify it once it's created. You could add to the

160

00:09:49,839  -->  00:09:52,630
splitter a row of buttons, and the

161

00:09:52,630  -->  00:09:55,060
buttons could be connected to control

162

00:09:55,060  -->  00:09:57,940
the orientation, or if it shows, and stuff

163

00:09:57,940  -->  00:10:00,490
like that. So, I'm pretty sure that's all

164

00:10:00,490  -->  00:10:06,310
we're going to do with Qt here. I

165

00:10:06,310  -->  00:10:08,649
know we're doing data visualization, and

166

00:10:08,649  -->  00:10:11,079
we're initially going to be exploring a

167

00:10:11,079  -->  00:10:13,810
library called matplotlib to do that,

168

00:10:13,810  -->  00:10:16,420
but I also understand that the Qt

169

00:10:16,420  -->  00:10:19,899
framework has a charting library as well.

170

00:10:19,899  -->  00:10:22,120
So we might actually circle around and

171

00:10:22,120  -->  00:10:24,430
come back to Qt here in the next little

172

00:10:24,430  -->  00:10:26,620
bit in order to do some data

173

00:10:26,620  -->  00:10:29,640
visualization.
