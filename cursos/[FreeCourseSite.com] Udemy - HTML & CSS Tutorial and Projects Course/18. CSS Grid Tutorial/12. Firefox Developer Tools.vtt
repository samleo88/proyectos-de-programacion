00:00.570 --> 00:07.150
Now why don't we take a breather and in fact let's test that out and let's explore in more detail the

00:07.210 --> 00:12.550
awesome Firefox developer tools and how they can help you when you're developing.

00:12.550 --> 00:13.490
Great.

00:13.510 --> 00:14.310
OK.

00:14.380 --> 00:18.940
Now first of all why don't we change this to just a simple grid gap.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.730
Grid gap and I'm gonna set this to let's say one hour Ms.

00:24.820 --> 00:28.400
Most organized right away one fraction like so.

00:28.450 --> 00:32.410
So now I have three column layout as well as three rows.

00:32.410 --> 00:40.540
Now Firefox has awesome developer tools whether you are using the Firefox developer edition or just

00:40.600 --> 00:41.980
a simple Firefox.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.580
Now in my case I'm using developer ignition but when I said you could as easily use a simple Firefox

00:48.580 --> 00:52.840
as well so I could test them out right here in a small browser window.

00:53.220 --> 00:58.120
But it's just going to be a little bit useful if we're going to head over to a bigger browser window

00:58.570 --> 01:00.920
as you see I'm using the Firefox.

01:01.090 --> 01:02.330
That should do it.

01:02.410 --> 01:09.700
Then in order to actually open up developer tools we just right click it click on Inspect Element and

01:09.700 --> 01:12.110
right away we can notice something interesting.

01:12.120 --> 01:17.340
There's this little tab that says okay you know what you are using the grid.

01:17.380 --> 01:18.790
That's an awesome start.

01:18.790 --> 01:25.400
Then if we head over here to the right hand side where we have our layout that is displayed we can notice

01:25.420 --> 01:28.930
that the container is in fact using the grid.

01:28.930 --> 01:31.480
Now here you also have a checkboxes.

01:31.480 --> 01:38.770
Now we haven't talked about yet the line numbers we haven't talked about the area names but then also

01:38.770 --> 01:42.900
we have extend lines indefinitely or infinitely sorry.

01:42.910 --> 01:49.990
So again we're gonna cover the line numbers the display area names as well as how is going to look like

01:50.080 --> 01:53.080
once we extend the lines infinitely.

01:53.080 --> 02:02.460
But notice we right away have the idea the actual display idea how our grid is going to look like.

02:02.830 --> 02:06.860
And that's usually one of the things as you're starting out with the grid.

02:06.900 --> 02:07.840
Well you kind of have this.

02:07.840 --> 02:08.120
Okay.

02:08.140 --> 02:12.120
So I'm setting up the grid but visually how this is going to look like.

02:12.430 --> 02:20.020
So this is where really Firefox come into play where you can in fact just visualize right away how your

02:20.020 --> 02:21.790
glare is going to look like.

02:21.880 --> 02:30.220
And as you notice as I'm going over my cells I can clearly see so that is going to be let's say a row

02:30.220 --> 02:31.620
three and column three.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.350
It says that right away.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.820
So as I'm going over I can notice.

02:35.820 --> 02:36.060
OK.

02:36.070 --> 02:39.010
Which cell I'm exactly talking about.

02:39.010 --> 02:44.500
Now when I said in order to make things interesting we're gonna head over back and I'm gonna change

02:44.500 --> 02:50.580
these values I'm going to say that you know what it is going to be hundred pixels or pixels.

02:50.740 --> 02:57.860
I'm going to have a three hundred pixel layout when we do the same thing here for this guy.

02:58.300 --> 03:02.080
And you know why don't we change it also around 4 euros.

03:02.090 --> 03:05.980
So I'm just going to grab all these values and you're gonna see in a second why I'm doing that.

03:05.980 --> 03:12.650
But when I copy and pasted so I'm going to have three rows as well as three three columns.

03:12.670 --> 03:17.140
Now if we head over back I would also like to see the line numbers.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.970
We haven't talked about them but I just want to show you how they're going to look like.

03:21.340 --> 03:26.740
So we're going to click on the line numbers and you'll notice that there's going to be some line numbers

03:26.740 --> 03:27.370
here.

03:27.370 --> 03:33.340
Now currently cannot see unfortunately the number one not sitting here on the left hand side.

03:33.760 --> 03:39.730
So one of the solutions if you have the same problem we can just head over where we have right now our

03:39.730 --> 03:40.930
container.

03:40.930 --> 03:41.670
Correct.

03:41.680 --> 03:47.440
And then for a container I'm just going to add a margin all around and I'm gonna go with I don't know

03:47.470 --> 03:49.090
let's say 10 areas.

03:49.090 --> 03:52.630
Now again please remember that I'm just changing that within the browser.

03:52.660 --> 03:56.620
So the moment I'm going to refresh it's going to go back to normal.

03:56.760 --> 03:57.300
OK.

03:57.400 --> 04:03.640
So now I set up an arms and notice there's going to be a line numbers where we have line numbers for

04:03.640 --> 04:10.240
the columns as well as the line numbers for these rows and this is gonna be very helpful when we're

04:10.240 --> 04:16.150
going to learn about them because this is going to again help us visualize what we are doing in fact

04:16.540 --> 04:23.620
because when using here says grid we're going to be able to in fact set up to sell let's say that uses

04:23.980 --> 04:30.910
the rows and the columns let's say columns starting from Column number 1 all the way to Column number

04:30.910 --> 04:38.320
three as well as using the rows starting here from the line number one all the way to line number three.

04:38.630 --> 04:45.880
But this should give you a visual idea that when we're setting up the grade we get these line numbers

04:46.090 --> 04:50.070
as well as for the columns as well as the robes correct.

04:50.110 --> 04:52.120
So everything is going to be numbered.

04:52.120 --> 04:58.630
So for the columns again we start with one then we go all the way to the four and you also notice that

04:58.630 --> 05:04.220
we have the negative this is gonna be come in handy later on when I'm going to show you how we can just

05:04.220 --> 05:08.900
set up calm spanning from one side all the way to another side.

05:09.080 --> 05:12.980
If let's say we don't know the number so that would be the line numbers.

05:12.980 --> 05:17.050
Now we're also going to later on talk about display Aryan names.

05:17.120 --> 05:23.240
Now currently we cannot see any area names because we haven't talked about areas yet but of course this

05:23.240 --> 05:24.810
is something that we're going to do.

05:24.920 --> 05:32.360
And then most of all we can also see the extend lines infinitely where I could just set up and you can

05:32.360 --> 05:38.570
see right now the lines that I'm using for the columns are in fact spanning infinitely as well as the

05:38.570 --> 05:42.360
lines that I'm using for the rows are spanning in fluently.

05:42.380 --> 05:52.460
Again these would be CSX grid tools that we can nicely use in the Firefox browser that really help you

05:52.460 --> 05:55.670
visualize of what kind of grid you have.

05:55.670 --> 06:02.000
Now I'm not going to do that on a smaller browser window because I already have everything pretty much

06:02.330 --> 06:08.030
using exactly the space that I would want because I would want you to clearly see what corner we're

06:08.030 --> 06:10.210
typing and what would be the result.

06:10.460 --> 06:16.250
But once in a while I'm going to switch back and forth and just to show you let's say what kind of values

06:16.250 --> 06:17.480
we have visually.

06:17.480 --> 06:23.480
Now it is going to be especially important once we start talking about the display numbers and display

06:23.480 --> 06:28.760
area names because it is going to help you visualize how your grid actually looks like.
