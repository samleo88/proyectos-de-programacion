00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,120
Hey guys, welcome back. I wanted to take
this opportunity to help you guys let us

2

00:00:06,120  -->  00:00:07,140
help you,

3

00:00:07,140  -->  00:00:12,750
and so basically when you're picking up
a programming language, or just the

4

00:00:12,750  -->  00:00:16,289
programming skills in general,
you're going to have problems and you're

5

00:00:16,289  -->  00:00:21,390
gonna do things incorrectly most likely,
hopefully not if I've done a good job at

6

00:00:21,390  -->  00:00:26,460
explaining things you shouldn't, but even
still you most likely will make some

7

00:00:26,460  -->  00:00:31,679
small problems. In PHP it's common that a lot of beginners, well actually a lot of

8

00:00:31,679  -->  00:00:34,050
advanced programs as well,

9

00:00:34,050  -->  00:00:37,230
will face eventually the fact that their
troubleshooting a problem for eight

10

00:00:37,230  -->  00:00:41,489
hours and pulling their hair out and
then they realize that the problem was

11

00:00:41,489  -->  00:00:48,090
just that they missed a semicolon on line
56, and luckily with Python we're not

12

00:00:48,090  -->  00:00:50,010
going to have that problem with the
semicolon,

13

00:00:50,010  -->  00:00:53,610
however a lot of the problems that you
might encounter are likely going to be

14

00:00:53,610  -->  00:00:59,850
very simple like that, and so I want to
show you guys a way to let us help you

15

00:00:59,850  -->  00:01:04,439
better and also for you guys to help
each other. When you have a problem with

16

00:01:04,439  -->  00:01:09,510
your code and you want it reviewed or
want someone to look at it and see if they

17

00:01:09,510  -->  00:01:13,530
can find the problem because sometimes
looking at your own code for a really

18

00:01:13,530  -->  00:01:17,670
long time trying to find a problem
you're looking at it too close,

19

00:01:17,670  -->  00:01:21,540
you need to stand back, and sometimes you just can't get the proper perspective to

20

00:01:21,540  -->  00:01:25,409
figure out the problem yourself. So, you
guys are going to have to share your

21

00:01:25,409  -->  00:01:30,630
code in the discussion to the right of
this video you're gonna you know

22

00:01:30,630  -->  00:01:34,770
basically say hey I got a problem with
this, this is what I'm trying to do, but you're

23

00:01:34,770  -->  00:01:38,640
also going to include a link to pastebin. So, if you guys don't know what

24

00:01:38,640  -->  00:01:44,340
pastebin is it's pastebin.com, and you
basically come here and you're going to

25

00:01:44,340  -->  00:01:51,000
copy and paste your code in here. Now
also you have a way to highlight for

26

00:01:51,000  -->  00:01:55,619
certain syntax, in this case it's going to
be Python. Paste exposure should be

27

00:01:55,619  -->  00:02:01,560
public or unlisted basically if it's
unlisted anybody that you give the link

28

00:02:01,560  -->  00:02:02,880
to will be able to view it and

29

00:02:02,880  -->  00:02:06,780
you can also title it, and then you just
create the new post, and then it's going

30

00:02:06,780  -->  00:02:11,250
to give you a URL. So, I'm just gonna do
this really quickly so that you guys can

31

00:02:11,250  -->  00:02:12,690
have an example.

32

00:02:12,690  -->  00:02:29,310
So, i'm going to write out a simple
line of code here that wouldn't work, it

33

00:02:29,310  -->  00:02:33,360
wouldn't do anything, but then i'm going
to share it. You can set expiry so just

34

00:02:33,360  -->  00:02:37,410
leave this to never, paste exposure can
be public or unlisted, and you can give

35

00:02:37,410  -->  00:02:47,280
the name "problem instantiating 
webpy" and I have selected the

36

00:02:47,280  -->  00:02:51,540
syntax highlighter of Python because
that's the programming language we're

37

00:02:51,540  -->  00:02:55,710
using, and then just click create new
paste. Now as you can see it did syntax

38

00:02:55,710  -->  00:02:59,640
highlight it, it gives it line numbers
and everything, you can download it, you

39

00:02:59,640  -->  00:03:03,990
can clone it, etc. Now all you need to do
to share is just come up to the address bar

40

00:03:03,990  -->  00:03:08,160
here and just copy this, and you're going
to put that link in the discussion

41

00:03:08,160  -->  00:03:11,760
section to the right of the video so
that when we look at the problem that

42

00:03:11,760  -->  00:03:15,270
you're having we can come here and see
your code, and we can tell you okay well

43

00:03:15,270  -->  00:03:19,290
the problem is on line 12, and this is
what's wrong with it, and then you can

44

00:03:19,290  -->  00:03:20,550
modify it accordingly.

45

00:03:20,550  -->  00:03:26,070
Now this also allows it to we can copy
this into our own code editors and then

46

00:03:26,070  -->  00:03:30,570
run your program on our computer just by
copying the text, so that's going to be

47

00:03:30,570  -->  00:03:36,540
helpful as well. So, thank you guys for
watching this video and for joining this

48

00:03:36,540  -->  00:03:40,800
course, and i'm excited to get started.
This is going to be fun!
