WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:03.300
We have added responsiveness using Fluxbox.

00:03.600 --> 00:06.930
Let's go ahead and let's actually do this with CSL grade.

00:07.130 --> 00:12.090
So we're going to go back over here and we're going to go to Maine you assess and let's say we're here

00:12.090 --> 00:14.250
we're going to come and disrupt this.

00:14.360 --> 00:14.940
Right.

00:14.970 --> 00:18.180
So we're going to come and go out and we're going to come and go.

00:18.370 --> 00:21.740
And and again we're going to have to start with the media.

00:22.080 --> 00:28.140
So we're going to say I mean here we are going to say screen right and we're going to say and now we're

00:28.140 --> 00:36.540
going to say men with or here and I'm going to say five so the six lines of 576 pixels.

00:36.580 --> 00:37.000
Right.

00:37.030 --> 00:39.670
And then we're starting the same way here.

00:39.960 --> 00:47.300
And then we're going to have a skills center know this and then we're going to have this play.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.440
We're going to Sigrid.

00:49.500 --> 00:54.930
So instead of flex now we're using the grid and all here and we're going to say for the grid template

00:54.930 --> 01:04.170
columns grid template columns and all are all going to say one fraction one fraction here and then we'll

01:04.170 --> 01:08.920
have a Grid column and then we're going to say gap.

01:09.060 --> 01:11.370
So we're going to say Grid column gap.

01:11.370 --> 01:13.230
And this is going to be space in between.

01:13.420 --> 01:14.550
And so we're going to say one.

01:14.570 --> 01:15.220
Yeah.

01:15.630 --> 01:22.160
And then over here again we would want for the actual skill to place the text in the center to say scale

01:22.680 --> 01:29.420
and this is going to be text align center line and I'm going to say Center this.

01:29.450 --> 01:30.770
We saved this.

01:30.810 --> 01:37.610
Then once we have the skill right you can see I misspelled it and over here we would want for a paragraph.

01:37.920 --> 01:45.530
So I'm going to say skill paragraph or here we're going to say margin or 0 zero.

01:45.870 --> 01:50.230
Again we're just placing it right in the center and all going out there with.

01:50.320 --> 01:50.490
Right.

01:50.520 --> 01:54.940
So with is going to be an 80 percent on hand like this.

01:54.980 --> 01:58.350
Now we need the same one for a bigger screen.

01:58.450 --> 01:58.800
Right.

01:58.830 --> 02:01.530
But this goes the columns are going to be four.

02:01.780 --> 02:07.230
So pretty much the same deal over here right just or here and we're going to do is we're going to copy

02:07.230 --> 02:10.220
and paste this like this.

02:10.320 --> 02:13.790
Then we're going to grab it and we're going to say 9 9 2.

02:14.100 --> 02:17.930
So this is going to be 9 9 to one like this.

02:17.940 --> 02:21.850
Then again we just need to check what is going to be the same right.

02:21.940 --> 02:24.460
This play grid Well we already have it right.

02:24.690 --> 02:28.470
Then gap Well we want the same gap actually right.

02:28.470 --> 02:29.640
So we just leave it over here.

02:29.670 --> 02:29.900
Right.

02:29.910 --> 02:34.700
So we can delete it in here let's do it this way again let's use a repeat.

02:34.700 --> 02:39.090
All right so what I'm saying is a repeat and repeat four of them right.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.390
One fraction really.

02:41.700 --> 02:45.510
Then we have all here skill and are here let's say the skill.

02:45.590 --> 02:46.130
Fine.

02:46.140 --> 02:47.800
We don't really care about skill.

02:47.880 --> 02:50.470
Skill is going to stay the same text align center.

02:50.640 --> 02:56.840
And here again with actually with 100 percent so we're going to back over here hundred percent.

02:57.030 --> 03:00.510
Let's say this and let's see whether we have the same look over here.

03:00.780 --> 03:04.640
So we're going to go back over here and we're going to check it out.

03:04.730 --> 03:08.440
Right now we can see that this is the look we have on here.

03:08.580 --> 03:08.900
Right.

03:08.940 --> 03:10.970
And if we go back over here right.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.640
This is the look that we have here.

03:12.690 --> 03:13.210
Right.

03:13.230 --> 03:19.490
So this is how it's going to work with any See it says X marks and with zero says GREEN Right.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.280
So basically we have two options.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.920
However you actually want to work with them.
