WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:03.390
So let's go ahead and let's create our last section.

00:03.480 --> 00:10.140
So here again we need to check where this section and I'm so on this is going to be on our song list

00:10.140 --> 00:11.440
section right.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.000
This was the song list.

00:13.170 --> 00:14.410
So that's right over here.

00:14.410 --> 00:16.180
And this is going to be a comment.

00:16.260 --> 00:20.130
This is going to be the end of song list.

00:20.430 --> 00:22.120
And then we're going to do well here.

00:22.170 --> 00:28.500
And this is going to be a songs so I'm going to write or hear songs Section 1 so I have the comment

00:28.640 --> 00:35.310
of songs section then I'm going to write on here and this is going to be a section and on here we're

00:35.320 --> 00:38.670
going to say this is going to be class of songs.

00:39.010 --> 00:46.820
I was going to say songs right then I have to I'm not going to have a heading one like this and I'm

00:46.830 --> 00:53.880
going to write top songs or write then all he'll going to write a div and this is going to be a song's

00:54.020 --> 01:00.840
center so I'm going to say or hear Dave and or hear this is going to have a class all your songs and

01:00.860 --> 01:05.800
we're going to say senator then not only is going to have a songs Center.

01:05.880 --> 01:09.470
We also need our carrousel because we're going to be using our cars.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.700
So we're going right over here now.

01:11.980 --> 01:16.770
So those are the two classes that we need actually for our cars to work.

01:17.010 --> 01:23.850
And we're going to all how or how rigorous rent once we have these two classes are here.

01:23.970 --> 01:28.900
Now would you would want to do is actually place articles that are going to be our songs.

01:28.900 --> 01:34.200
So I'm going to say we're here an article like this and I'm going to give it a class of song right.

01:34.320 --> 01:34.920
Right.

01:34.950 --> 01:40.170
So once we have the article then we'll get right over here heading three and we're going to say this

01:40.170 --> 01:44.630
is going to be an artist artist over here.

01:44.670 --> 01:50.220
Then the next one is going to be a heading for and this is going to be a song.

01:50.580 --> 01:56.030
And then after that we would want to have a div of song container.

01:56.210 --> 01:57.120
I pressed tab.

01:57.120 --> 02:00.970
Now we have some container and here we're going to write image.

02:01.110 --> 02:01.610
Right.

02:01.890 --> 02:05.880
And again we're going to have the same image we're going to have images and this is going to be song

02:05.880 --> 02:08.590
one song one.

02:08.620 --> 02:10.440
I know where he'll get the right song.

02:11.100 --> 02:18.820
And once we have this now we'll do what I want is a I can write that we're actually going to be placing

02:18.940 --> 02:20.390
as we're hovering right.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.580
So I'm going to say we're here.

02:21.590 --> 02:30.000
I know this is going to be a mess and we're going to say F A and this is going to be music music or

02:30.130 --> 02:36.470
press tab and I can see that I have my icon or right all the way in the bottom right now.

02:36.460 --> 02:41.940
What I would also want to do is actually place this on my in the actual link.

02:41.940 --> 02:42.450
All right.

02:42.560 --> 02:48.730
So I'm going to say over here this is going to be a trap here and I'm going to say we're here and this

02:48.730 --> 02:51.970
is going to be class so long.

02:52.780 --> 02:54.200
Icon right.

02:54.340 --> 02:59.480
And let's play this here and start it over here right.

02:59.530 --> 03:01.510
So song like right.

03:01.810 --> 03:07.240
Once we have this now we want to create eight of these right here.

03:07.270 --> 03:11.560
So what I'm going to do over here again I'm just going to write and this is going to be song.

03:12.010 --> 03:20.530
This is going to be the end of song and of song and I can't copy and paste this a time and still within

03:20.700 --> 03:27.440
the right I will grab this and let's copy this sometimes so one two three four five six seven.

03:27.670 --> 03:28.140
All right.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.990
And was just scroll down right.

03:30.070 --> 03:32.030
This is going to be number two.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.840
This is going to be again number three.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.840
This is going to be number four.

03:37.860 --> 03:49.090
Number five number here six and seven and this is going to be number eight.

03:49.510 --> 03:57.460
So now that we have them let's go to names you assess what's actually started styling them.

03:57.720 --> 04:04.550
So I would say this is going to go up to main success and go all the way and the bottom line know here

04:04.570 --> 04:06.630
we're going to say that this is going to be songs.

04:07.130 --> 04:11.580
I mean again place a hashtags like this right.

04:11.610 --> 04:13.800
And these are going to be songs.

04:13.870 --> 04:19.820
So we're going to say we're here and this is going to be songs and we're going to first add a padding

04:20.590 --> 04:25.570
when you say here and this is going to be a padding of 40 pixels and zero.

04:25.850 --> 04:33.460
So I'm going to say songs and we're going to say padding 40 pixels and zero here like that.

04:33.480 --> 04:33.720
Right.

04:33.720 --> 04:42.030
So pretty much top bottom 40 pixels that I'm going to work with a song setting one the top songs and

04:42.140 --> 04:48.590
one will get it right or here we're going to say this is going to be songs handing one and do you want

04:48.590 --> 04:55.830
to hear text transform transform when you say how good is this.

04:55.850 --> 05:05.480
And then we're going to have a margin of 20 I'm 0 0 20 pixels and 20 pixels like this then we're going

05:05.480 --> 05:06.800
to work with actual song.

05:06.830 --> 05:11.140
So we're going to write something or you are going to say text on line.

05:11.240 --> 05:18.150
When I say Center we're here and with we're going to also going to say 90 percent or so right.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.580
Then Margene we're going to say zero.

05:21.590 --> 05:22.330
All right.

05:22.340 --> 05:26.740
So basically the whole song we're actually placing in a center right.

05:26.750 --> 05:33.290
We're saying that song should be only 90 percent and then margin 0 or so then we're going to work with

05:33.290 --> 05:37.110
this song or hear three or like this.

05:37.130 --> 05:44.990
I'm going to say text transform and we're going to set up twice like this and then we're going to have

05:45.100 --> 05:49.600
a slim margin or you know what let's do it differently right.

05:49.670 --> 05:52.460
Let's work with the actual song over here.

05:52.460 --> 05:52.740
Right.

05:52.730 --> 05:58.250
So I'm going to say song and we're going to say heading for here we're going to say that this is going

05:58.250 --> 05:59.790
to be a margin.

06:00.170 --> 06:08.180
And it is going to be 10 pixels and then zero like this and then we're going to say again text transform

06:09.740 --> 06:14.770
text transform and you're going to say again it's going to be capitalized.

06:14.810 --> 06:16.870
Now we would want to change the color.

06:17.140 --> 06:24.860
And so I'm going to say that the color is going to be color and this is going to be hashtag 8 8 8 8

06:24.920 --> 06:26.990
the year like this.

06:26.990 --> 06:31.370
And now what you would want to do is work with an actual container.

06:31.880 --> 06:40.080
So basically what I want to do right now is I want to place this icon in the middle right when I'm hovering.

06:40.210 --> 06:42.850
And so basically it should shouldn't be here right now.

06:42.850 --> 06:43.040
Right.

06:43.040 --> 06:49.640
So only as I'm hovering right I'm going to create this effect and it's looking on here as I'm hovering.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.130
Now we're going to get an icon.

06:51.470 --> 06:57.590
So we're going to go back over here and we're going to say this is going to be song container right.

06:57.590 --> 07:02.530
This is the container that actually has this image right here.

07:02.630 --> 07:06.760
What you would want to do is since we're going to be using the absolute positioning right.

07:06.950 --> 07:09.000
We're going to say position relative right.

07:09.020 --> 07:13.110
And this is important if we're going to be using position absolute for this guy.

07:13.250 --> 07:17.300
And then also what we would want is overflow.

07:17.300 --> 07:18.060
Hidden.

07:18.070 --> 07:18.770
All right.

07:18.800 --> 07:22.910
Because what's going to happen is we're going to scale the image right.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.720
However as we add these properties I'm actually going to show you what happens if we don't add.

07:27.770 --> 07:28.850
So don't worry about it.

07:28.850 --> 07:29.640
Right.

07:29.660 --> 07:34.950
BORGER And we're going to say eight years it's going to be 20 pixels.

07:35.010 --> 07:41.560
All right then margin I'm going to say we're here is going to be 10 pixels.

07:41.580 --> 07:42.430
That's right.

07:42.470 --> 07:48.350
And you can see that I messed that up because this is container right now we're actually affecting the

07:48.350 --> 07:48.910
container.

07:48.910 --> 07:50.750
And before that we're not doing that.

07:50.750 --> 07:51.480
All right.

07:51.490 --> 07:55.750
So now what do we want to do is have a song.

07:56.180 --> 08:03.150
When I say saw an image like this I'm going to say this play block like this.

08:03.330 --> 08:07.250
Then we're going to have a with what we we're going to say 100 percent.

08:07.490 --> 08:09.290
And it is important to do it right.

08:09.290 --> 08:15.770
Actually important because again we're going to be dealing with a whole carousel that uses absolute

08:15.770 --> 08:16.930
positioning.

08:16.940 --> 08:19.380
Right so that's right or really important.

08:19.400 --> 08:19.830
Right.

08:20.060 --> 08:25.640
And then what you want to do is have a opacity and transformation.

08:25.640 --> 08:26.320
All right.

08:26.330 --> 08:32.390
So first what I'm going to say is the transition I'm going to say all and let's say again this is going

08:32.390 --> 08:38.450
to be two seconds two seconds is like this right.

08:38.630 --> 08:46.250
However here what I'm going to say is that as I'm hovering over the song someone else's song image over

08:47.890 --> 08:54.130
here opacity is going to be actually 0.7 right here.

08:54.130 --> 09:01.540
And also we'll do a little bit of transformation and so we're going to say transform scale one point

09:01.630 --> 09:05.850
to me and you see what happens right as I'm hovering over.

09:06.020 --> 09:12.610
All right I can see that what's happening is that actually my image is actually changing right now.

09:12.610 --> 09:19.170
What is important right is for me you can see that right now the image is zooming in red.

09:19.360 --> 09:25.350
However if I would have had it over here let's say that we are going to come in this one out.

09:25.550 --> 09:26.120
Right.

09:26.230 --> 09:29.910
And you can see or hear what's happening image is actually getting bigger right.

09:29.980 --> 09:36.190
And we don't want and that's why it's important for the container to have this awful hit it right.

09:36.250 --> 09:43.430
Once we have this the next thing that we would want to do is work with an actual song I can do it all

09:43.430 --> 09:44.200
here.

09:44.560 --> 09:50.950
So I'm going to say really this is going to be something that we're going to say on and once we have

09:51.010 --> 09:56.450
a font size it's going to be 30 pixels.

09:56.530 --> 10:01.240
To have a padding of 10 pixels like this.

10:01.570 --> 10:09.330
And then we're going to have a display and this play is going to be inline block in one block or here.

10:09.850 --> 10:12.890
Then the caller is going to be orange.

10:13.030 --> 10:21.410
So when you say orange EF 1 5 0 2 5 0 like this then border.

10:21.420 --> 10:27.350
So when I say border and an order is going to be two pixels solid.

10:27.990 --> 10:29.660
And this is going to be hashed.

10:29.690 --> 10:37.420
EF 1 5 0 2 5 0 0 like this then we're going to have a broader radius.

10:37.560 --> 10:47.340
It's going to be 50 percent right this cursor we're going to say pointer pointer on this then transition

10:47.700 --> 10:52.230
we're going to say it all right so we're going to say transition and we're going to write all.

10:52.370 --> 10:54.720
And again this is going to be two seconds.

10:55.260 --> 10:56.180
Two seconds.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.490
He's like this.

10:58.690 --> 11:00.240
Now the most interesting part.

11:00.280 --> 11:06.940
And so first one would want to do is have a position right I'm going to see position.

11:07.090 --> 11:08.970
Absolute.

11:08.970 --> 11:09.510
That's right.

11:09.510 --> 11:12.270
And I can see that it actually has disappeared.

11:12.300 --> 11:17.160
Right then we're going to say left and this is going to be 50 percent.

11:17.170 --> 11:17.870
Right.

11:17.930 --> 11:21.650
And here top also is going to be 50 percent.

11:21.900 --> 11:25.440
Now you can see it up here or here right now this is important why.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.130
To have this position relative right.

11:28.260 --> 11:32.810
Because this container's actually right now a parent container for this position.

11:32.910 --> 11:33.280
Right.

11:33.450 --> 11:40.320
So this is important to actually do it right now once we have this top and left.

11:40.320 --> 11:44.580
Now what I would want is actually place it exactly in the center because you can see that it's not exactly

11:44.580 --> 11:45.320
in center.

11:45.600 --> 11:53.210
So I'm going to say transfer one and I'm going to say translate I'm going to say negative 50 percent.

11:53.430 --> 11:53.750
Right.

11:53.770 --> 11:57.360
You can see that I'm moving it right and negative 50 percent right.

11:57.540 --> 12:00.500
So now I can see that it actually moves in the center right away right.

12:00.690 --> 12:06.480
So this is the exact same center because before that it wasn't really in the center because it actually

12:06.570 --> 12:09.700
took in account its own dimensions.

12:10.110 --> 12:16.880
And so now we have this right now what we want is to have opacity and we're going to say zero.

12:17.260 --> 12:18.400
So it disappears.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.200
However we're going to be hovering over.

12:21.300 --> 12:27.480
So I'm going to say song icon and I'm going to say however I like this I'm going to say that this is

12:27.480 --> 12:29.750
going to be a color right.

12:29.820 --> 12:37.120
So this is going to be color color is going to be one white f f f here.

12:37.170 --> 12:40.150
Border color more color.

12:40.260 --> 12:48.210
When I say color and this is going to be hash tag EF 1 5 0 to 5 and background is also going to change

12:48.210 --> 12:48.460
right.

12:48.450 --> 12:52.360
So hash tag 1 5 0 to 5 on here like this.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.340
Right now we cannot see it right now.

12:54.340 --> 12:54.730
Right.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.840
Because we're even though we're hovering the capacity is zero.

12:57.840 --> 13:09.650
However I'm going to say here some container cover like this and we're going to say song icon icon on

13:09.650 --> 13:10.180
here.

13:10.360 --> 13:13.750
And we're going to say what opacity is going to be one.

13:13.790 --> 13:15.140
So let's see how it happens.

13:15.140 --> 13:15.770
Right.

13:15.770 --> 13:24.070
So as you can see as I'm hovering over the container right the actual icon is actually appearing right.

13:24.140 --> 13:28.380
However if I go to the actual icon right now we have another effect.

13:28.380 --> 13:29.050
All right.

13:29.210 --> 13:32.810
So that's about it for the main thesis.

13:33.100 --> 13:36.450
Now what we would need to do is actually had our outlook so.
