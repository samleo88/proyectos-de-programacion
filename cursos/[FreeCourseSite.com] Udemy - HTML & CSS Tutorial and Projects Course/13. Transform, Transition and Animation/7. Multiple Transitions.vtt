Luckily for us as we working we transition property we're not limited to only one property.

00:06.420 --> 00:12.510
So what if let's say for number three the one that actually has the transition I would like to add another

00:12.510 --> 00:14.510
thing and other property with a hover.

00:15.030 --> 00:20.130
Well we have two options I can either add this property here or all of them since here I'm just selecting

00:20.130 --> 00:20.810
all the divs.

00:21.130 --> 00:23.490
Moreover it can be more precise and I can say you know what.

00:23.670 --> 00:27.950
As I'm hovering over the three I would like to change in on border radius.

00:28.260 --> 00:31.620
And in this case I would need to add my sudo selector.

00:31.620 --> 00:36.750
So I'm going to say as I'm hovering over the three I would like to have border radius and let's say

00:36.750 --> 00:38.410
this is gonna be 50 percent.

00:38.550 --> 00:43.560
And again I would just like to pay attention to the fact that I could have added this to all of them

00:43.980 --> 00:45.720
and it's gonna do exactly the same thing.

00:45.720 --> 00:51.090
The difference would be that this is gonna be applied to all the divs in this case since this is the

00:51.090 --> 00:53.720
only one we're using the transition property.

00:53.770 --> 00:57.940
That's the reason why I'm adding it specifically to hover off 3.

00:57.990 --> 01:04.830
So as I'm hovering what happened what I see is that my border areas changes instantly and the color

01:04.830 --> 01:06.050
is taking for.

01:06.510 --> 01:09.820
Because for now only thing we're having is transition property.

01:09.820 --> 01:15.190
And the name was background so the way we're going to do this is we're going to have a comma that will

01:15.190 --> 01:19.050
be the syntax and then we just need to again write the property name.

01:19.280 --> 01:19.720
OK.

01:19.770 --> 01:25.440
This is going to be border natives and we also have an option of let's say what kind of duration is

01:25.440 --> 01:29.010
gonna be for the second property if we don't want it to be for seconds.

01:29.070 --> 01:34.110
We just need to again another value in our case we're gonna leave it for now the same.

01:34.110 --> 01:35.560
So this would be four seconds.

01:35.700 --> 01:41.980
And this is gonna happen the same way where the color is gonna take four seconds as well as the Boeri.

01:42.340 --> 01:49.980
However if we're gonna add here I don't know two seconds then the radius is going to happen in two seconds

01:50.310 --> 01:52.670
and you can see still that color is changing.

01:52.920 --> 01:57.690
So that would be the way how we can add multiple properties with our transition property.
