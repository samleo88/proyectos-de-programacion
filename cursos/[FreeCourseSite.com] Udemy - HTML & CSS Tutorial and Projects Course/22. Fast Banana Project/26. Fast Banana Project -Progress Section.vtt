WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:03.450
So let's start building our next section.

00:03.450 --> 00:08.460
So we're here I'm going to say this is going to be a comment and we're going to say this is going to

00:08.460 --> 00:18.510
be progress and progress bar section progress bars section more here.

00:18.550 --> 00:20.580
So grab the line.

00:21.250 --> 00:23.770
Embrace this and let's right away right.

00:23.820 --> 00:30.680
And of progress bar section then after not what we would want is actual section.

00:30.980 --> 00:37.300
So going going write on your section and then we're going to say or your ID and what would be in 90

00:37.650 --> 00:42.550
we're going to say this is going to be a progress bar progress or here.

00:43.350 --> 00:50.290
Now when we have a progress bar section then the next thing that we would want is actual progress center.

00:50.400 --> 00:57.020
So we're going to say we're here we're going to say this is going to be a day of progress Research Center.

00:57.300 --> 01:03.360
And once we have this you want the actual item in order here the way we're going to do that.

01:03.450 --> 01:13.000
I'm going to say we're here and this is going to be a day of with a progress item class like this.

01:13.040 --> 01:21.030
Then within days of we're going to have another one with a progress text progress and this is going

01:21.030 --> 01:27.270
to be text within this progress that we're going to have a two heading twos or here the first one is

01:27.270 --> 01:33.690
going to say HVM now we're here and the second one is actually going to be percentage.

01:33.720 --> 01:39.470
So here I'm just going to copy this line and on here we're going to say this is going to be 35 percent

01:39.900 --> 01:47.340
or you know like this and then still in the progress item but not in progress.

01:47.340 --> 01:54.630
Next we're going to have ID of the bar or Here one.

01:54.630 --> 02:00.140
So basically progress bar one because we have four of them so that's why we're setting a unique ID or

02:00.140 --> 02:00.560
here.

02:00.800 --> 02:01.090
All right.

02:01.110 --> 02:05.200
And nothing is showing right now because we haven't the javascript.

02:05.340 --> 02:12.570
Now what I would want to order here within the progress center here I'm going to have a for items like

02:12.570 --> 02:13.160
this.

02:13.380 --> 02:23.340
I'm going to grab this one two and three and here again we can just select the whole thing apply a beautify

02:23.910 --> 02:26.970
or here just so it's easier for us to work.

02:26.970 --> 02:32.710
All right so now they're all in one line and all here and this is going to be C Ss.

02:32.820 --> 02:40.230
This is going to be 70 percent you this and then the next one is going to be a javascript and it's going

02:40.230 --> 02:46.450
to be 60 script and let's say this guy's going to be 60.

02:46.640 --> 02:51.490
And then after that we're going to have a different Jawa.

02:51.600 --> 02:51.850
Right.

02:51.860 --> 02:56.640
So this is going to be Johore and this is let's say Haiti.

02:56.900 --> 03:00.370
Now what I want to do here is progress bar.

03:00.620 --> 03:02.050
And we're going to change already.

03:02.180 --> 03:06.910
This is for us history and this is going to be number two.

03:07.180 --> 03:07.810
Right.

03:07.850 --> 03:15.380
So we say this now we're going to go actually and style them and then we're going to look at how we

03:15.380 --> 03:20.610
can work with them to how we can i javascript's how we can actually see what's happening.

03:20.900 --> 03:26.450
So here we're going to say main success we're going to hear what we're going to do is this is going

03:26.450 --> 03:28.100
to be hashtags.

03:28.100 --> 03:35.520
So we're going to say that this is going to be progress bars progress bars and much of hashtags on here.

03:36.380 --> 03:45.880
And we're going to open this one I'm going to say hash tag progress and we're going to say bars or here

03:45.900 --> 03:47.610
what I would want to say is first.

03:47.680 --> 03:53.250
This is going to be padding hundred pixels and it's all around for D.S. there's going to be hundred

03:53.260 --> 03:55.140
pixels and zero.

03:55.260 --> 04:02.770
And so it's only going to be top and bottom then after that I would want a background since the background

04:02.770 --> 04:05.040
we already have done right.

04:05.080 --> 04:10.650
I just want to find where is our short cut right.

04:10.660 --> 04:16.300
Because I don't want to write all of them right and it's right over here because what we need to do

04:16.300 --> 04:21.340
is actually just change the image and the image is going to be my case.

04:21.340 --> 04:27.540
This is going to be filler one so I'm going to say on here that this is going to be Baghran filler one.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.170
And so let's go back over here and let's change the actual image.

04:33.460 --> 04:44.680
So here we're going to see images slash background here filler and will say one here like this.

04:44.740 --> 04:47.970
So let's see what we need to change or here.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.890
In my case you see it's not J bag.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.230
It's GBG.

04:53.230 --> 04:58.060
All right so that's one of the things that can always happen with them and just make sure their extensions

04:58.060 --> 05:02.300
actually match right of what you have or hear in images.

05:02.320 --> 05:07.860
Then after that what we would want is a progress item progress.

05:08.110 --> 05:15.610
And here I am more here and I'm going to say on here margin is going to be 20 pixels wide so we're just

05:15.610 --> 05:23.410
going to set some margins in between in between them so they're not actually stacked on top of each

05:23.410 --> 05:24.070
other.

05:24.340 --> 05:30.660
Then over here we're going to work with this progress center progress and we're going to say somewhere

05:31.170 --> 05:40.780
on this I don't want to say Max with is going to be 70 percent 70 percent and then we're going to have

05:40.810 --> 05:43.480
a margin zero nada.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.730
All right so we're going to still place them in the center.

05:47.140 --> 05:50.430
And then after that we'll have a progress text.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.890
So here now to start dealing with this section.

05:52.890 --> 05:53.860
All right.

05:53.860 --> 05:59.110
And I know it's kind of hard to see right but these programs are going to be all right because I want

05:59.110 --> 06:03.060
to finish with whatever we are doing and then I want to deal with the progress.

06:03.290 --> 06:12.880
So here I'm going to say progress we're all going to set text right here display and say flex I read

06:13.230 --> 06:13.910
so I can see that.

06:13.910 --> 06:21.450
First of all line them up here that I have justified content space between right so I push them as far

06:21.450 --> 06:29.470
as I can from each other then we're them to change color and the color is going to be hashtags 0 0.

06:29.910 --> 06:33.310
And then we're going to have seven in one right.

06:33.350 --> 06:40.680
This is going to be the blue color and text transform uppercase so text transform and we're going to

06:40.680 --> 06:43.550
say operators really like this.

06:43.590 --> 06:51.590
And then we have actually two classes here again and we have actually from the progress bars.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.020
Jay query why.

06:54.180 --> 06:54.420
Right.

06:54.420 --> 07:00.650
So we're going to say this for now I'm going to go back and again if we go to same website right Jake

07:00.660 --> 07:01.800
where you are.

07:02.080 --> 07:07.520
We really go to demos and we find where is the actual progress bar.

07:07.580 --> 07:11.550
Right so we're going to look here and this is the accordion.

07:11.570 --> 07:11.930
Right.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.510
So I can see over here but I just want to show you where you can find it all here right.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.130
And on here this is progress bar.

07:19.140 --> 07:20.780
If we click here right.

07:20.850 --> 07:27.830
Again we have simple examples and then get more and more interesting.

07:27.830 --> 07:28.330
Right.

07:28.620 --> 07:35.160
But then right away where we can do as a quick source note here you can see from this source again whatever

07:35.160 --> 07:38.280
we needed to include and on here how simple is this.

07:38.280 --> 07:38.940
Right.

07:38.970 --> 07:40.290
So we have progress more.

07:40.410 --> 07:42.490
This would be the ID right.

07:42.510 --> 07:46.570
In this case if it's progress bar Id these are going to match.

07:46.860 --> 07:50.020
And one would need to do is just copy and paste this right.

07:50.110 --> 07:54.140
Again we can write it ourselves or we could just get right away code.

07:54.200 --> 07:58.170
So then I'd say in some cases we don't mess it up right.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.850
But obviously in most cases we would write ourselves.

08:00.870 --> 08:05.690
So here we have a script J.S. and it sort of this was a Korean Right.

08:05.700 --> 08:08.810
And we wanted to make sure that this one ends up here.

08:09.000 --> 08:15.130
What I'm going to do here I'm going right can't comment progress rebars.

08:15.410 --> 08:15.960
Right.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.840
And then I'm going to copy and paste this.

08:18.060 --> 08:25.860
And over here if we have you read our values we're going to be different because first of all we have

08:25.920 --> 08:27.360
a different idea.

08:27.820 --> 08:28.370
Right.

08:28.550 --> 08:36.810
So if we're going to go back over here and if we have ID P bar no here one right and the value we're

08:36.810 --> 08:42.380
actually going to set it to let's just keep it at 37.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.070
So I'll say this.

08:44.170 --> 08:48.900
Now here you can see the moment I have it right now I have my progress bar.

08:49.140 --> 08:52.410
So the only thing left for me to do is I actually have four of them right.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.880
So one two three.

08:55.050 --> 08:55.550
Right.

08:55.590 --> 08:59.580
And again on here you can try maybe to unify works right.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.860
Sure it does.

09:00.860 --> 09:02.520
You are going to change too.

09:02.570 --> 09:03.650
This is going to be three.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.520
And this is going to be for now over here.

09:06.570 --> 09:10.810
The values we need to change this one was 70.

09:11.010 --> 09:14.770
I'm sorry this one was 37 this one was a..

09:14.820 --> 09:20.710
Then this game was 60 and this one over here was 80 right.

09:20.820 --> 09:24.150
So he said this and now I have four programs Barsel here.

09:24.150 --> 09:24.750
Right.

09:25.070 --> 09:31.580
And now again let's go back over here and maybe Let's open it in a Google tools.

09:31.580 --> 09:32.190
All right.

09:32.430 --> 09:34.540
So let's do next again.

09:34.870 --> 09:40.670
And I was going to scroll it down and this is going to be our progress merge and if we go back over

09:40.680 --> 09:45.790
here and say inspect and like this again it's the same thing.

09:45.880 --> 09:46.530
Right.

09:46.830 --> 09:50.960
So what we're going to have is a classes right.

09:51.180 --> 09:53.530
And the class is actually that we need style.

09:54.540 --> 09:58.580
Right so it's not just going to be some class that we came up with right.

09:58.620 --> 10:00.460
We have a UI.

10:00.590 --> 10:03.340
We just had her here.

10:03.390 --> 10:05.090
And then we have a contest.

10:05.090 --> 10:05.490
All right.

10:05.490 --> 10:07.650
So you why widget contest.

10:07.980 --> 10:14.400
So here let's go back to our main assess and let's start dialing in because we already did the javascript

10:14.400 --> 10:14.880
part.

10:15.120 --> 10:18.880
So we can close scrimmaging Yes and main theosis.

10:19.010 --> 10:23.760
I'm just showing you where I'm getting the classes so it doesn't look like I'm just taking them out

10:23.760 --> 10:24.370
of thin air.

10:24.370 --> 10:25.000
Right.

10:25.070 --> 10:28.170
So I'm going to say that you you're high.

10:28.740 --> 10:34.510
We did it and we're going to say content more like this.

10:34.550 --> 10:38.520
All right you can see that right away in brackets gives us a border all around.

10:38.530 --> 10:39.270
Right.

10:39.410 --> 10:43.230
And not going to say right now I'm going to say 20 pixels more.

10:43.380 --> 10:44.760
And again nothing happens.

10:44.820 --> 10:48.290
And when we already know what we need to do we need explanation mark.

10:48.290 --> 10:48.660
All right.

10:48.670 --> 10:50.230
Important.

10:50.230 --> 10:50.940
All right.

10:51.020 --> 10:51.950
You can see what happens.

10:51.950 --> 10:54.110
Right now we're actually controlling it.

10:54.350 --> 10:59.840
Then we're going to set a different background so background is going to be let's say hash tag five

11:00.080 --> 11:01.370
three or five.

11:01.660 --> 11:02.600
All right.

11:02.650 --> 11:04.760
So this is going to be in the background here.

11:05.110 --> 11:06.910
And again we need to do the same thing right.

11:06.910 --> 11:11.590
So important right now I can see how it changed.

11:11.700 --> 11:19.180
Then we have a border and the border is going to be three pixels solid no hash tag it's going to be

11:19.200 --> 11:24.930
0 0 and a 7 1 7 1.

11:24.930 --> 11:29.510
And again we're going to have important here like this.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.850
All right so now we have the border.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.690
Then after that what you want is the widget.

11:34.830 --> 11:44.110
And so the other class I'm going to say UI widget widget here and we're going to say had her hand her

11:44.110 --> 11:44.590
or her.

11:44.680 --> 11:47.960
And for that know we're going to have a background on our radio.

11:48.020 --> 11:54.860
And I have a hashtag FFC nine one 4 and again nothing happens which is important.

11:55.030 --> 11:58.170
Right now we have over here our progress.

11:58.330 --> 11:58.860
Right.

11:59.170 --> 12:06.460
So you can see that how slowly when we're building and we're not using a bootstrap right we're not using

12:06.460 --> 12:13.990
any kind of preset classes can actually with the help of CSSA fluxbox and see just as great and in some

12:13.990 --> 12:22.300
cases Jake the plug ins or Shakeri why we can actually achieve everything that actually bootstrap is

12:22.300 --> 12:23.380
offering.

12:23.430 --> 12:26.350
Now let's go on and let's build the next section.
