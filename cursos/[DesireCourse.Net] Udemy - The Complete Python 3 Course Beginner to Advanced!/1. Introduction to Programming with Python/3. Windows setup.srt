1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,340
Alright guys, so, we've already learned

2

00:00:02,340  -->  00:00:04,920
about installing and using Python within

3

00:00:04,920  -->  00:00:09,780
Mac OS and Linux. Those two operating

4

00:00:09,780  -->  00:00:11,550
systems actually have a very similar

5

00:00:11,550  -->  00:00:13,290
process that's because they're both

6

00:00:13,290  -->  00:00:15,900
derived from the UNIX operating system,

7

00:00:15,900  -->  00:00:18,660
where Windows is not. So, Windows is a

8

00:00:18,660  -->  00:00:19,770
little bit different, so I'm going to

9

00:00:19,770  -->  00:00:22,560
walk you guys through this right now. You

10

00:00:22,560  -->  00:00:25,380
need to go to python.org, once you get to

11

00:00:25,380  -->  00:00:27,240
python.org you need to hover over

12

00:00:27,240  -->  00:00:29,699
downloads here, and then

13

00:00:29,699  -->  00:00:31,349
find Windows here. It should also be

14

00:00:31,349  -->  00:00:33,390
defaulted to Windows if you're on

15

00:00:33,390  -->  00:00:37,890
Windows. So, we're going to be choosing

16

00:00:37,890  -->  00:00:39,329
which version we're going to be using

17

00:00:39,329  -->  00:00:41,550
and we are always going to be using

18

00:00:41,550  -->  00:00:45,690
Python 3 not 2, so ignore Python 2.

19

00:00:45,690  -->  00:00:48,420
Click Python 3.6.1 and

20

00:00:48,420  -->  00:00:50,219
it's going to download the installer for

21

00:00:50,219  -->  00:00:53,129
you. Now, when this is done downloading we

22

00:00:53,129  -->  00:00:55,260
can install it. So just launch the

23

00:00:55,260  -->  00:01:01,590
program, and let me just uninstall

24

00:01:01,590  -->  00:01:03,780
this first so that I can

25

00:01:03,780  -->  00:01:18,930
reinstall it. While this is

26

00:01:18,930  -->  00:01:20,369
uninstalling we're going to be talking

27

00:01:20,369  -->  00:01:24,450
about the environment variables and why

28

00:01:24,450  -->  00:01:26,970
you need them, and wehn I installed

29

00:01:26,970  -->  00:01:29,909
Python on Windows a while back there was

30

00:01:29,909  -->  00:01:33,960
a problem with the path, or maybe not the

31

00:01:33,960  -->  00:01:36,840
path but specifically the Python

32

00:01:36,840  -->  00:01:40,560
installer package which we're going to

33

00:01:40,560  -->  00:01:42,420
be discussing. And if you guys do have

34

00:01:42,420  -->  00:01:45,060
the problem that I had it's going to be

35

00:01:45,060  -->  00:01:47,729
terrible, but there's an easy

36

00:01:47,729  -->  00:01:51,060
workaround for it. Alright, so, let's close

37

00:01:51,060  -->  00:01:53,970
that and then run the Python 3.6

38

00:01:53,970  -->  00:01:56,610
installer. Now there's one very important

39

00:01:56,610  -->  00:01:58,710
thing that we need to do and that is you

40

00:01:58,710  -->  00:02:02,130
need to check add Python 3.6 to path, and

41

00:02:02,130  -->  00:02:07,439
then click install now. Now while that's doing that, I'm going to search for

42

00:02:07,439  -->  00:02:10,860
control panel here, and in the control

43

00:02:10,860  -->  00:02:13,230
panel let's go into system. If you don't

44

00:02:13,230  -->  00:02:13,890
see this view

45

00:02:13,890  -->  00:02:16,830
right-click up here and select small

46

00:02:16,830  -->  00:02:19,560
icons. This should work on Windows 7

47

00:02:19,560  -->  00:02:21,840
8, or 10, and everybody should be on

48

00:02:21,840  -->  00:02:23,459
one of those operating systems anyway

49

00:02:23,459  -->  00:02:28,740
because, Vista might not be end of

50

00:02:28,740  -->  00:02:31,050
life yet. Vista it was either

51

00:02:31,050  -->  00:02:33,750
April or May that that was happening and

52

00:02:33,750  -->  00:02:38,130
it's April now. So, anyway, if you're on

53

00:02:38,130  -->  00:02:41,520
Windows 7, 8, or 10 go to system

54

00:02:41,520  -->  00:02:43,560
and on the left-hand side click advanced

55

00:02:43,560  -->  00:02:45,569
system settings. It's going to pop this

56

00:02:45,569  -->  00:02:48,510
up right here. Specifically, if you are

57

00:02:48,510  -->  00:02:51,030
not on the Advanced tab to begin with, if

58

00:02:51,030  -->  00:02:52,800
you're someone over here, go to the

59

00:02:52,800  -->  00:02:56,100
Advanced tab, and now here at the bottom you're

60

00:02:56,100  -->  00:02:57,600
going to see an environment variables

61

00:02:57,600  -->  00:02:59,700
button. Click that and it's going to bring up

62

00:02:59,700  -->  00:03:02,040
the environment variables configuration

63

00:03:02,040  -->  00:03:04,950
screen. Now the specific one that we're

64

00:03:04,950  -->  00:03:10,920
interested in is the path variable. These

65

00:03:10,920  -->  00:03:12,870
are system variables and these are user

66

00:03:12,870  -->  00:03:16,230
variables, I'm going to double click on

67

00:03:16,230  -->  00:03:17,730
this path variable and as you can see

68

00:03:17,730  -->  00:03:23,340
we've got python 3.6 3.2 added to the path

69

00:03:23,340  -->  00:03:26,910
which means every time I run a program

70

00:03:26,910  -->  00:03:29,280
that resides in one of these paths,

71

00:03:29,280  -->  00:03:33,329
Windows is going to know where to look

72

00:03:33,329  -->  00:03:34,739
for it because it's going to check all

73

00:03:34,739  -->  00:03:37,680
these paths first, and then all these

74

00:03:37,680  -->  00:03:40,440
paths in that one. And then if it

75

00:03:40,440  -->  00:03:41,670
doesn't find it then it's going to say,

76

00:03:41,670  -->  00:03:43,709
okay, well, I don't really know what

77

00:03:43,709  -->  00:03:45,900
you're looking for, and that's why we add

78

00:03:45,900  -->  00:03:49,350
paths to the path variable. So, that has

79

00:03:49,350  -->  00:03:53,340
been added, if I open up a command prompt

80

00:03:53,340  -->  00:03:58,500
here you will see that if I run Python

81

00:03:58,500  -->  00:04:03,360
it's going to successfully find it and run

82

00:04:03,360  -->  00:04:06,090
the program. Now that is because I have

83

00:04:06,090  -->  00:04:09,150
it installed to that path. Up here you

84

00:04:09,150  -->  00:04:11,880
can see users, my user, app data, local, etc.,

85

00:04:11,880  -->  00:04:18,150
and as you can see

86

00:04:18,150  -->  00:04:20,280
right here that is the path that was

87

00:04:20,280  -->  00:04:23,850
added. So, every time I run Python this is

88

00:04:23,850  -->  00:04:25,259
one of the first paths it checks, and it

89

00:04:25,259  -->  00:04:27,120
goes well, do I have a Python.exe file,

90

00:04:27,120  -->  00:04:30,419
and it does. Now you can also run all of

91

00:04:30,419  -->  00:04:32,580
the programs from the scripts directory

92

00:04:32,580  -->  00:04:35,759
including pip, and so that's what we're

93

00:04:35,759  -->  00:04:37,050
going to talk about right now. Let me

94

00:04:37,050  -->  00:04:43,470
exit out of here. So, pip basically for

95

00:04:43,470  -->  00:04:45,360
example if you wanted to build a web

96

00:04:45,360  -->  00:04:50,430
scraper or a web crawler and

97

00:04:50,430  -->  00:04:51,780
if you just wanted to have a program

98

00:04:51,780  -->  00:04:54,419
that would download certain pages, what

99

00:04:54,419  -->  00:04:55,830
you would have to do is build scraper.

100

00:04:55,830  -->  00:05:00,090
And in PHP, for example, you have access

101

00:05:00,090  -->  00:05:03,479
to curl, it's shipped with

102

00:05:03,479  -->  00:05:06,810
curl. There is no default requests

103

00:05:06,810  -->  00:05:08,729
library for Python, so you'll have to

104

00:05:08,729  -->  00:05:12,810
install one. And usually you are

105

00:05:12,810  -->  00:05:14,430
going to be using some type of framework

106

00:05:14,430  -->  00:05:17,130
or library within Python just because

107

00:05:17,130  -->  00:05:18,120
it doesn't make sense to continue

108

00:05:18,120  -->  00:05:20,130
rewriting things that other people

109

00:05:20,130  -->  00:05:22,800
already have. So, you're going to be doing

110

00:05:22,800  -->  00:05:24,210
a lot of this, so I recommend getting

111

00:05:24,210  -->  00:05:26,280
used to it. We're going to go ahead and

112

00:05:26,280  -->  00:05:27,960
install a package that we're going to be

113

00:05:27,960  -->  00:05:29,430
using for web scraping and that is

114

00:05:29,430  -->  00:05:33,060
called requests. So what you need to do

115

00:05:33,060  -->  00:05:38,310
is type pip install, and then the name of

116

00:05:38,310  -->  00:05:39,870
the package you want to install. Now this

117

00:05:39,870  -->  00:05:41,669
is the problem I was getting before so I

118

00:05:41,669  -->  00:05:44,159
guess a reinstallation did not fix the

119

00:05:44,159  -->  00:05:45,870
problem, and I have no idea what the

120

00:05:45,870  -->  00:05:48,510
problem is I've been reading this stack

121

00:05:48,510  -->  00:05:53,099
overflow thread and so far I haven't

122

00:05:53,099  -->  00:05:55,710
discovered what the problem is, but there

123

00:05:55,710  -->  00:06:01,050
are a few workarounds. So number one

124

00:06:01,050  -->  00:06:03,750
probably the one we're going to go with

125

00:06:03,750  -->  00:06:06,090
is since you can run Python from the

126

00:06:06,090  -->  00:06:07,380
command line because that's been added

127

00:06:07,380  -->  00:06:10,020
to the path you can actually work around

128

00:06:10,020  -->  00:06:14,760
this by typing python -m pip

129

00:06:14,760  -->  00:06:19,560
install requests, and I've already got it

130

00:06:19,560  -->  00:06:20,639
installed so it's just going to say

131

00:06:20,639  -->  00:06:23,010
requirement already satisfied, but it

132

00:06:23,010  -->  00:06:26,000
should install for you guys.

133

00:06:28,750  -->  00:06:31,210
Anytime you see me in this course type pip

134

00:06:31,210  -->  00:06:34,240
install anything, all you Windows guys

135

00:06:34,240  -->  00:06:38,740
remember use python -m pip install

136

00:06:38,740  -->  00:06:40,210
and then whatever you're going to

137

00:06:40,210  -->  00:06:42,340
install. So that is how you install

138

00:06:42,340  -->  00:06:44,560
things with pip, and now once we've got this

139

00:06:44,560  -->  00:06:46,510
installed if I were to jump back into

140

00:06:46,510  -->  00:06:49,420
Python you can just import the library

141

00:06:49,420  -->  00:06:51,340
that you just created, and now you have

142

00:06:51,340  -->  00:06:55,960
access to that class. And that is how to

143

00:06:55,960  -->  00:06:58,900
get set up with this stuff on Windows. I

144

00:06:58,900  -->  00:07:00,790
hope you guys enjoy this course, I'm

145

00:07:00,790  -->  00:07:03,810
definitely going to.
