00:00.590 --> 00:04.680
We were going to start our transform journey by looking at the translate.

00:04.940 --> 00:11.540
But before we do anything and see assess I would like to head over back to next Schimmel and here like

00:11.540 --> 00:16.730
already usually will then create some days but we're not going to place any content we're just gonna

00:16.760 --> 00:21.620
say that first one is gonna have class of 1 and then you probably guessed it you're all going to have

00:21.620 --> 00:23.220
class and number two.

00:23.360 --> 00:28.700
Then we have the third one with class of number three and that's gonna do with HMO.

00:28.850 --> 00:30.460
And then we have the CSF.

00:31.130 --> 00:35.950
Well in the C as this let's just start and by some general styling and let's say I don't know with there's

00:35.960 --> 00:41.870
gonna be a hundred and fifty pixels hopefully is gonna look good not I'm going to change it then the

00:41.870 --> 00:47.830
height also goes in B hundred fifty let's add height hundred fifty and this is not what I wanted.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.920
So this is gonna be the correct one.

00:50.120 --> 00:50.870
And what else.

00:50.900 --> 00:56.890
Well we can also maybe display not in line but in line BLOCK So a little bit different.

00:56.960 --> 01:02.140
Is not gonna make this play block which obviously would be by default for the divs but this is gonna

01:02.150 --> 01:03.240
be in line block.

01:04.100 --> 01:04.690
OK.

01:04.730 --> 01:05.420
What is next.

01:05.450 --> 01:12.020
Well we can first add maybe some colors so let's say background is gonna be red for number one and that's

01:12.020 --> 01:14.120
going to be my live and you know what.

01:14.120 --> 01:19.630
Let me copy and paste it again 1 two 3 as well as I would like to change these.

01:19.700 --> 01:24.980
So this guy's going to be number two for number three.

01:25.100 --> 01:25.700
I don't know.

01:25.700 --> 01:27.710
Again whatever colors you like.

01:28.100 --> 01:35.280
I think I'm gonna go with my typical ones of let's say a green and then the last one is gonna be blue.

01:35.680 --> 01:39.380
So again let me select this say a whole year.

01:39.590 --> 01:40.990
I'm gonna be working in the pool.

01:41.180 --> 01:47.630
So nice three blocks maybe I'm gonna make this a little bit bigger because I want them side by side

01:47.660 --> 01:48.920
and you'll see in the second one.

01:49.490 --> 01:51.800
Now what is the situation would translate.

01:52.100 --> 01:58.860
Well first of all let's get the property which will gonna be transform so transform property.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.730
But then within the transform you notice that we're getting the rotations the scaling as well as as

02:04.730 --> 02:10.130
we start scrolling down we have the SKU and translate now for and translate.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.410
It's gonna be very interesting because translate is gonna be the function.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.720
Now what does that mean.

02:14.720 --> 02:20.690
Well that means that if we can get translate X which is gonna work with the exact action then we have

02:20.690 --> 02:26.000
the Y which is gonna work in the y direction and then we just have the plain old translate.

02:26.330 --> 02:32.000
So let's start with X. Now like I said the X is gonna work with x axis.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.560
So here I can write whatever values I would like.

02:34.760 --> 02:40.630
I can write pixels if I want more I can write percentage not just to show you how this is gonna work.

02:40.820 --> 02:46.610
I can just say I don't know 20 pixels now what's gonna happen is that the box is gonna move right now

02:46.610 --> 02:49.910
20 pixels to the right because the value is positive.

02:49.980 --> 02:55.100
However if we're gonna change it and if I'm gonna say negative 20 pixels obviously this is going to

02:55.090 --> 02:57.230
move negative 20 pixels.

02:57.230 --> 03:00.080
In this case though the movement is gonna be to the left.

03:00.590 --> 03:02.000
So if we're adding the negative.

03:02.150 --> 03:07.120
This is gonna move the left direction however positive is gonna move the right direction.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.540
So far so good.

03:08.540 --> 03:14.710
Now we also have an option of 50 percent or I'm sorry percent but we're all going to use 50 percent.

03:14.840 --> 03:16.490
Now how is that going to look like.

03:16.490 --> 03:22.450
Well let's say we're gonna move it 50 percent and obviously since the value was positive again we moved

03:22.460 --> 03:23.380
the right direction.

03:24.050 --> 03:30.900
Here's the kicker though 50 percent means 50 percent of this hundred and fifty pixels.

03:31.070 --> 03:32.060
Don't believe me.

03:32.060 --> 03:38.420
Well let's look at the third one which was blue and you saw that initially there exactly in the same

03:38.420 --> 03:39.380
position.

03:39.380 --> 03:45.290
Now if you didn't notice that then I can just come in this out and you can see that there city exactly

03:45.290 --> 03:46.700
where the other one was.

03:46.740 --> 03:47.340
Okay.

03:47.540 --> 03:53.380
What if I go here and I do the same thing where I use the transform just only with the pixels.

03:53.810 --> 04:02.360
So what happens is I can just say not 50 percent but let's say 75 pixels and you can see that 75 pixels

04:02.360 --> 04:05.810
would be exactly the half from half and 50.

04:05.810 --> 04:13.130
So that tells me that this 50 percent is going to reflect on the actual width of deal.

04:13.670 --> 04:19.830
So if I'm gonna change it here let's say to 300 pixels then obviously this is gonna move way more.

04:19.830 --> 04:24.950
Well maybe this was a little bit too drastic example it's maybe go with hundred and then we can see

04:24.950 --> 04:31.190
that this is not gonna work exactly the same because they're not gonna be in one line but I hope you

04:31.190 --> 04:37.550
understood the idea where if I am moving this to the right by 50 percent that is gonna mean exactly

04:37.550 --> 04:42.960
half of its width and I can double check that by moving the third guy.

04:42.960 --> 04:46.450
Exactly seventy five pixels and they're all gonna match.

04:46.500 --> 04:50.500
Well if we're looking at it we see that there's gonna be translate X.

04:50.730 --> 04:52.260
Can we do translate one.

04:52.340 --> 04:52.680
No.

04:52.710 --> 04:53.910
I think we can figure it out.

04:54.300 --> 05:00.120
So we have transform the four transformations we can do instead of X we're gonna do Y.

05:00.520 --> 05:03.450
And here again let's just get out first by pixels.

05:03.510 --> 05:08.100
So if we're gonna say 30 pixels man right away let's do the negative.

05:08.100 --> 05:13.620
Now my box moved up because I went into negative direction.

05:13.620 --> 05:18.930
So if I'm gonna get rid of the negative one now I see it went down because we are moving the positive

05:18.930 --> 05:21.630
direction again very straightforward.

05:21.690 --> 05:22.770
You want to move it up.

05:22.770 --> 05:24.590
This is gonna have to be negative.

05:24.600 --> 05:28.580
You want to move it down then this is gonna have to be positive.

05:28.590 --> 05:31.860
We also have an option of actually combining them both.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.230
So let me come on this out.

05:33.660 --> 05:37.620
Let me start a new one again transform translate.

05:37.620 --> 05:40.240
And then if I'm not adding x or y.

05:40.350 --> 05:45.870
Now the first value is gonna be x axis and the second one is gonna be y axis.

05:45.870 --> 05:48.210
Again endless amount of possibilities.

05:48.250 --> 05:52.780
And I don't think that there is a point to covering them just to show you how this is going to work.

05:52.780 --> 05:59.830
So let's say I would like to move this 20 pixels on the exertion and then add another 30 pixels in the

05:59.830 --> 06:00.960
y direction.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.040
So what happens is that the box moves 20 pixels to the right and then 30 pixels.

06:06.040 --> 06:10.840
Now because we move that obviously in the right direction if we want to move with let's say a little

06:10.840 --> 06:15.610
bit more can do two hundred pixels by 300 pixels.

06:15.820 --> 06:20.470
And then now the box is going to move two hundred pixels to the right and then three hundred pixels

06:20.470 --> 06:21.510
down again.

06:21.520 --> 06:27.550
We can use the percentages here we can use the negative values and I'll let you explore in more detail

06:27.550 --> 06:28.660
if you'd like to.

06:28.660 --> 06:34.960
But generally this is how we can work we transform and translate function within the CSF.
