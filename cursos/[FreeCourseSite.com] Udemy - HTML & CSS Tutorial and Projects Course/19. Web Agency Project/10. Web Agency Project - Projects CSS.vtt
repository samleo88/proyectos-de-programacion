WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:04.590
So let's go to our main series house here.

00:04.740 --> 00:06.780
And as always all the way to the bottom right.

00:06.810 --> 00:14.730
We're going to create more space we're here and I was going to say this is going to be projects like

00:14.730 --> 00:17.730
this and then I'm going to say that for the project's title.

00:17.730 --> 00:17.930
Right.

00:17.940 --> 00:24.780
What would be the first thing that's going to say were here projects or here title text.

00:24.900 --> 00:25.200
Right.

00:25.230 --> 00:27.360
Because we're going to be changing different background.

00:27.510 --> 00:32.460
So I would want to text to stand out right so we're going to give this black color superhero in some

00:32.480 --> 00:36.120
sense going and we one nine or color.

00:36.230 --> 00:40.640
And this is going to be hash tag 1 9 1 7 1 6.

00:40.700 --> 00:45.170
So this is going to be black right now and then we're going to have for the actual project.

00:45.180 --> 00:45.930
Right.

00:46.300 --> 00:52.110
So over here right projects and they're all going to say we want.

00:52.130 --> 00:55.310
First we say this is going to be 20 pixels.

00:55.490 --> 01:03.050
We're going to zero and then we're going to be 80 pixels pixels or here and then we'll have zero in

01:03.570 --> 01:04.140
here.

01:04.260 --> 01:10.180
And then the background color and color over here we're going to say this is going to be hash tag.

01:10.590 --> 01:12.100
And it's going to be zero.

01:12.480 --> 01:15.680
And then we have to D-B to the right.

01:15.710 --> 01:19.860
So you know this and then we need to style the products contain.

01:19.940 --> 01:20.570
Right.

01:20.640 --> 01:25.910
So we're going to say projects and then I'm going to say container right.

01:25.950 --> 01:30.970
And this is actually class not a handy container.

01:31.390 --> 01:36.590
I was going to open this one and we're going to say Max with an we're here we're going to say 90.

01:36.590 --> 01:37.040
Right.

01:37.050 --> 01:38.930
And you remember again what we're doing right.

01:38.970 --> 01:41.080
So we're setting the whole container.

01:41.200 --> 01:41.650
Right.

01:41.700 --> 01:48.000
So those three items right these three pictures right now we're a huge they're actually living inside

01:48.000 --> 01:48.170
there.

01:48.180 --> 01:48.640
Right.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.330
So we're just setting the whole with the whole thing.

01:51.340 --> 01:51.580
Right.

01:51.580 --> 01:59.520
So you worked on this and then we're going to have a margin of zero auto right.

01:59.610 --> 02:02.180
So now I can see how we placed that actually in the center.

02:02.340 --> 02:05.250
And don't worry we're going to fix the image it's not going to look like this.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.000
Right.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.160
And then we have a project item.

02:08.350 --> 02:08.970
Right.

02:09.380 --> 02:15.340
So here we're going to write project we're going to say item here and what should be the item.

02:15.450 --> 02:21.810
And this is going to be a position to say relative that we're going to have a background that we're

02:21.810 --> 02:23.470
going to have a linear back room right.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.420
So we're great here.

02:27.030 --> 02:36.330
And then again we're going to do the same thing on G.P.A. and this is going to be 0 0 0 0 0 0 and this

02:36.330 --> 02:44.720
is let's say eight this time and again our G.P.A. and 0 0 0 0 0 8.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.430
So something like this.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.530
So now that we have this then we're going to go to cultural color.

02:50.720 --> 03:00.990
I'm going to say that color is going to be hash tag again 0 e to be to be like this and it's going to

03:00.990 --> 03:03.350
be the color then it's going to be overfull right.

03:03.360 --> 03:08.550
And again we need to sell it didn't him so he can actually work with these properties that we want to

03:08.550 --> 03:09.020
do.

03:09.300 --> 03:15.540
And then last thing is going to be margin is going to be 10 pixels and that is actually making let's

03:15.540 --> 03:18.130
say 20 light and 0.

03:18.150 --> 03:23.660
Right so this is only so they are again not stacking up against each other on the smaller screen.

03:23.700 --> 03:24.350
Right.

03:24.360 --> 03:29.010
Once we're set with a project item Let's time to actually make the images smaller.

03:29.010 --> 03:29.770
Right.

03:29.820 --> 03:34.750
So here I'm going to say this is going to be projects and we're going to say image right.

03:35.080 --> 03:39.090
And what should be the name module going to say first we're going to say with we're going to say 100

03:39.120 --> 03:40.850
percent right.

03:40.920 --> 03:46.710
So this is you can see right away how it actually got a Images right.

03:46.710 --> 03:47.490
They're not as big.

03:47.820 --> 03:50.850
They're sponsored right away when we have with 100.

03:50.850 --> 03:57.600
Right now we're going to say Monheit also going to say 100 million like this then we're going to say

03:57.950 --> 03:58.750
display.

03:58.810 --> 04:00.680
I'm we're going to say this play block.

04:01.050 --> 04:05.110
And the last thing that I'm willing to do is transition is transform.

04:05.340 --> 04:11.640
So I'm going to say we're here to transition transform we're here and transform is going to again I'm

04:11.640 --> 04:14.080
going to for four seconds.

04:14.150 --> 04:14.990
Right.

04:15.600 --> 04:20.190
Then for a actual image text or image.

04:20.420 --> 04:22.270
And we're going to say text right.

04:22.290 --> 04:23.500
What should happen right.

04:23.700 --> 04:26.240
First this is going to be positioned absolutely right.

04:26.260 --> 04:29.330
And again you right away you can see that we're going to start hiding right.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.860
So position absolute right.

04:32.130 --> 04:36.750
Then you're going to have a top say 50 percent.

04:36.920 --> 04:37.420
Right.

04:37.710 --> 04:43.530
Then we're going to have a left 50 percent 50 percent.

04:43.530 --> 04:49.180
And then over here we're going to have a transform and we're going to use the translate property right

04:49.300 --> 04:56.740
trancelike and we're going to say this is going to be negative 50 right and negative 50.

04:56.790 --> 05:00.620
And this is the old school way of doing of actually centering.

05:00.620 --> 05:01.200
Right.

05:01.470 --> 05:05.770
And over here we're going to say text the and center right.

05:05.810 --> 05:11.090
We obviously could have used a flex box but I just wanted to kind of show you what would be the old

05:11.220 --> 05:11.740
right.

05:11.850 --> 05:16.640
And we're going to say that we're going actually going high that we're going to say a possibly zero.

05:16.640 --> 05:17.030
Right.

05:17.110 --> 05:23.510
So now I can see that it's hidden and then transition and transition is going to be opacity Pasotti.

05:23.570 --> 05:26.500
And again this woman was set for four seconds.

05:26.670 --> 05:32.990
Right now we have this I actually need to have to work with a full length.

05:33.170 --> 05:34.630
So again we're going to go over here.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.490
We're going to say this is going to be image for her.

05:37.580 --> 05:37.770
Right.

05:37.850 --> 05:40.790
So class image for her.

05:40.880 --> 05:45.890
And again what's going to happen here we're going to say display and we're going to say display flex

05:46.190 --> 05:48.930
because we want to push them away from each other right.

05:48.960 --> 05:53.990
And here we're going to say just different content space between right and I can see in every way from

05:53.990 --> 05:57.270
each other with is going to be around 100 percent.

05:57.620 --> 06:07.280
So with 100 percent or here this then you're going to have a position and we're going to take an absolute

06:07.850 --> 06:09.430
position absolute.

06:09.610 --> 06:18.830
And then we're going to have left 0 0 0 or so replacing it all the way in the bottom of the image or

06:18.830 --> 06:25.340
image container and we're going to have padding of ten pixels all around then it's going to be font

06:25.580 --> 06:31.150
size 20 size 20 pixels over here.

06:31.260 --> 06:37.580
And then again we're going to say a is zero and CALLER 1 is going to be in the caller again is going

06:37.580 --> 06:41.660
to be hash tag six.

06:42.030 --> 06:46.920
Hey an F to e to.

06:47.460 --> 06:47.850
Right.

06:47.990 --> 06:52.390
So now that we have that transition again it's going to be capacity transition.

06:52.470 --> 06:55.910
I see no real going to say for seconds.

06:56.210 --> 07:00.730
So now we have this now we want to work with those image text and we.

07:00.770 --> 07:01.190
Right.

07:01.370 --> 07:03.800
So again we can maybe change this one for now.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.160
Right so we can actually see this.

07:06.350 --> 07:10.080
Otherwise this is going to take us we're not going to be able to see what we're doing right.

07:10.280 --> 07:17.510
So for image text 1 I know what no one can actually this is when we can hide or just do this is only

07:17.510 --> 07:22.340
two things or here I think you're going to forgive me for the fact that you can see what you are doing

07:22.820 --> 07:31.970
font size or here we're going to say 30 pixels and then we're going to see margin bottom right margin

07:32.480 --> 07:35.030
bottom 10 pixels.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.140
Right so now we have this guy over here.

07:37.280 --> 07:42.710
And then one for a image text six for heading six.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.390
So I don't know what we should do.

07:44.420 --> 07:52.130
Just copy and paste this or something like this 6 or here we're going to say font size it will say 15.

07:52.520 --> 07:57.410
So something like this and margin bottom was going to get rid of God.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.200
There's going to be no margin in the bottom.

08:00.200 --> 08:04.860
And now we wouldn't want actually to resolve the fact that we can see them.

08:05.410 --> 08:13.340
A project over here and we're going to see item and then we're going to have a hover effect.

08:13.460 --> 08:17.030
This is when we're going out we're going to have hover image.

08:17.180 --> 08:25.630
And what happens is we're going to have a capacity here and we're going to say 0.4 or this.

08:25.640 --> 08:28.870
So for the actual image read the passage is going to change.

08:28.900 --> 08:35.420
They're also going to have a transform and we're going to say this is going to be scaling 1.3.

08:35.420 --> 08:35.850
Right.

08:35.900 --> 08:38.020
So now we're working with an actual image.

08:38.030 --> 08:38.670
Right.

08:38.720 --> 08:44.960
And then the last thing that we would want to do as we're hovering we're right so we can just copy project

08:45.040 --> 08:46.610
items were.

08:46.760 --> 08:53.320
So copy this one pasted and then are really going to say this is going to be image text.

08:53.420 --> 08:54.250
Right.

08:54.800 --> 08:58.730
And then we're going to get this line copy this one in or here.

08:58.770 --> 09:01.770
This is not going to be image text this is going to be Image footer.

09:01.890 --> 09:02.180
Right.

09:02.180 --> 09:07.410
So for both of them we're going to set up passively and we're going to save one life.

09:07.480 --> 09:12.290
So now we say this over here you can see what happens right.

09:12.350 --> 09:15.790
First of all you can see the images zooming in right.

09:15.920 --> 09:19.410
And also everything is appearing only as I'm hovering right.

09:19.550 --> 09:23.030
You can see the Nampa is in four seconds becoming one.

09:23.030 --> 09:23.660
Right.

09:23.660 --> 09:28.330
So the last thing that we want to do is actually set up again in response class.

09:28.340 --> 09:28.970
Right.

09:28.970 --> 09:34.960
So again if we don't want to write the whole thing right we can find it more with the shorter version.

09:35.030 --> 09:35.500
Right.

09:35.550 --> 09:41.480
Well actually that wasn't so and maybe Let's create one here and we're going to say or here that this

09:41.480 --> 09:43.660
is going to be meteor screen.

09:44.180 --> 09:51.380
We're going to say screen and no real going to say this is going to be men with.

09:51.440 --> 09:51.760
Right.

09:51.770 --> 09:55.640
And we're going to say 576 576 pixels.

09:55.820 --> 09:57.630
And then what was going to happen.

09:57.980 --> 10:04.460
We're going to go with year cause it out and then this is going to be there all right.

10:04.460 --> 10:10.910
Or you know like this and then I'm going to have a project's container projects

10:13.380 --> 10:21.840
container and then over here we're going to have display grid this play grid and then we're going to

10:21.840 --> 10:32.170
have a grid template once grid grid or here template columns and this is going to be repeat.

10:32.230 --> 10:36.440
Right so we're going to use again this available option right.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.280
So we're going to be using a repeat.

10:38.310 --> 10:39.690
We're going to write to.

10:40.140 --> 10:46.380
And this is going to be one fraction of it so two times one for action and this is going to be for the

10:46.380 --> 10:51.780
Gap grade Kahlon or year gap.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.460
And this is going to be one.

10:53.630 --> 10:57.870
And this and then we're going to have for the bigger screen.

10:57.870 --> 10:58.140
Right.

10:58.140 --> 11:00.200
So this is for the smaller screen.

11:00.210 --> 11:03.920
So if go back or here copy and paste this.

11:04.530 --> 11:12.360
And this is going to be 9 9 2 9 9 9 2 and then we're going to have the same thing display red right

11:12.750 --> 11:19.070
gets cases going we repeat three and call them up again let's leave it at one right.

11:19.310 --> 11:25.470
So this has got to refresh our agency right now it can have a project.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.150
Right now you can see that we're hovering right.

11:28.290 --> 11:33.600
We have the effect you can see that I had it over here so my colon and we managed him down so that was

11:33.600 --> 11:34.940
pretty smart.

11:34.940 --> 11:38.560
So now I have to go all the way back and actually fix this.

11:38.580 --> 11:44.080
So here is the we don't want to see Michael and I know we're here.

11:44.080 --> 11:51.540
And if we can back up and just fix this I might call and say this right and fresh and you can see that

11:51.540 --> 11:58.920
if I'm going to make this smaller right as I'm making shrinking the screen now we have two columns and

11:58.920 --> 12:03.200
if we go all the way to the small screen is going to be two columns.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.070
But over here this is going to be one column.

12:05.110 --> 12:05.660
All right.

12:05.670 --> 12:11.760
And again you can always change the screen so you think would look better right now you know how but

12:11.760 --> 12:16.230
I just think that this is full for these kind of props for these kind of pictures right and it's going

12:16.230 --> 12:17.400
to look a little bit better.

12:17.640 --> 12:21.060
And now we're done with this section and really to move on to next.
