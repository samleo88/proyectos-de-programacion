Hey guys.

00:00.810 --> 00:08.250
In our next module will cover transform transition and animation properties along with their supplementary

00:08.250 --> 00:13.080
properties in the CSF while these are definitely important topics.

00:13.110 --> 00:18.630
I'll try to keep example short and sweet since I think it is more important to spend time working with

00:18.630 --> 00:23.470
these particular properties in our projects where we can get a better understanding.

00:23.550 --> 00:26.900
How can they be used in the real world situations.

00:27.060 --> 00:34.140
Briefly transform property apply some type of transformation to the element B translational along X

00:34.140 --> 00:41.790
axes or y axis rotation scaling or skewing transition property on the other hand is in charge of making

00:41.790 --> 00:45.690
state changes occurring over some period of time.

00:45.900 --> 00:51.750
So let's say we hover over the button and the background color of the button changes with transition

00:51.750 --> 00:55.820
property we can control how long that stage change will occur.

00:56.190 --> 01:02.310
Animation property is very similar to the transition with major difference being that we are not limited

01:02.340 --> 01:09.030
to just two points beginning and the end of the chain animation gives us many extra points where we

01:09.030 --> 01:12.600
can control how the change from one state to another takes place.
