00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,939
Last time on Python Beginner to Advanced...

2

00:00:02,939  -->  00:00:06,330
just kidding, but seriously last time

3

00:00:06,330  -->  00:00:08,730
what we did in here is we used the pandas

4

00:00:08,730  -->  00:00:11,460
library to quickly construct a data

5

00:00:11,460  -->  00:00:14,700
frame that we can then take and use as

6

00:00:14,700  -->  00:00:16,830
though it were a different type of object, and

7

00:00:16,830  -->  00:00:19,890
this basically makes things a lot faster

8

00:00:19,890  -->  00:00:24,210
in compiling and creating data. So what

9

00:00:24,210  -->  00:00:25,650
we're going to do with this at this point

10

00:00:25,650  -->  00:00:30,869
is we are going to create, we're going to

11

00:00:30,869  -->  00:00:33,450
create a pie chart from it. So, first off

12

00:00:33,450  -->  00:00:36,420
what I want to do is talk about colors

13

00:00:36,420  -->  00:00:38,760
and how we can tell each piece of the

14

00:00:38,760  -->  00:00:41,100
pie to have its own color, and that is

15

00:00:41,100  -->  00:00:44,489
simply to create the colors list here

16

00:00:44,489  -->  00:00:51,420
using RGB values, yeah. So, 1, .4, .4

17

00:00:51,420  -->  00:00:53,280
is going to be the first one, that's

18

00:00:53,280  -->  00:00:55,530
going to be a soft red, we're going to

19

00:00:55,530  -->  00:01:03,449
say...

20

00:01:03,449  -->  00:01:15,689
1, .6, 1. Let's say .5, .3, 1, put that in there

21

00:01:15,689  -->  00:01:17,700
as well, I'm just trying to create

22

00:01:17,700  -->  00:01:21,150
regular old items in a list here and

23

00:01:21,150  -->  00:01:24,600
that is not going to work. Let's make a

24

00:01:24,600  -->  00:01:31,590
green one so .3, 1, .5, and then one

25

00:01:31,590  -->  00:01:34,530
more because we have five people that

26

00:01:34,530  -->  00:01:36,119
we're going to be creating the data

27

00:01:36,119  -->  00:01:39,990
for, and so we're going to say

28

00:01:39,990  -->  00:01:42,630
.7, .7, .2, and I'm not

29

00:01:42,630  -->  00:01:44,009
sure what these colors are going to come

30

00:01:44,009  -->  00:01:46,409
out as. I can tell you this one is going

31

00:01:46,409  -->  00:01:48,450
to be red, this one is going to be a

32

00:01:48,450  -->  00:01:53,520
purple. This one is going to be almost

33

00:01:53,520  -->  00:01:57,390
purple like between blue and purple, but

34

00:01:57,390  -->  00:01:59,340
anyway aside from the colors themselves

35

00:01:59,340  -->  00:02:01,049
what we're going to do is we're going to

36

00:02:01,049  -->  00:02:06,930
say plt.pie, and the data that we're

37

00:02:06,930  -->  00:02:08,640
going to be using is this final row that

38

00:02:08,640  -->  00:02:11,430
we've created called total_ir. So, df

39

00:02:11,430  -->  00:02:13,590
['total_ir']

40

00:02:13,590  -->  00:02:19,410
And labels, so we're going to use the

41

00:02:19,410  -->  00:02:24,180
names, so labels is going to be df,

42

00:02:24,180  -->  00:02:30,060
what did we call that, names, colors is

43

00:02:30,060  -->  00:02:35,700
going to be equal to color, and let's do

44

00:02:35,700  -->  00:02:40,019
auto percent as well. So, autopct equals

45

00:02:40,019  -->  00:02:43,170
again this funny string %1.1%%

46

00:02:43,170  -->  00:02:46,769
I'll really have to figure out

47

00:02:46,769  -->  00:02:50,040
why we use that. Then we're going to show

48

00:02:50,040  -->  00:02:53,849
the pie chart. Let's go ahead and start

49

00:02:53,849  -->  00:02:58,769
the app, and there you go. Some of these

50

00:02:58,769  -->  00:03:00,209
colors were completely different from

51

00:03:00,209  -->  00:03:08,190
how I thought they would be. Anyway, I was

52

00:03:08,190  -->  00:03:10,470
way off. Alright, so that's how you can

53

00:03:10,470  -->  00:03:14,190
use pandas with pie charts to make pie

54

00:03:14,190  -->  00:03:16,769
charts, but again we can also do

55

00:03:16,769  -->  00:03:18,959
different things with the pie chart as

56

00:03:18,959  -->  00:03:21,389
well. What we're going to do really the

57

00:03:21,389  -->  00:03:22,709
the only thing we're going to do here is

58

00:03:22,709  -->  00:03:25,920
we're going to set, we're going to set

59

00:03:25,920  -->  00:03:28,859
the access to equal so that it keeps

60

00:03:28,859  -->  00:03:36,329
everything you know looking in the

61

00:03:36,329  -->  00:03:39,930
correct aspect ratio here. So you're going

62

00:03:39,930  -->  00:03:43,609
to create that and there, we've got our data.
