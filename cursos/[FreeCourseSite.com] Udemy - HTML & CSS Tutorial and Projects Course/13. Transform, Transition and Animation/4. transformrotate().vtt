00:00.600 --> 00:04.890
After that we have the rotate and I have to be right away straight up honest with you.

00:04.890 --> 00:11.850
That with rotations the x and y directions are gonna be hard to see especially as I'm showing this.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.350
And the example.

00:13.470 --> 00:19.290
Now it's gonna be easier to see is gonna be rotate Z and we're also gonna look at the shortcut and that's

00:19.290 --> 00:24.420
the reason why I'm going to start right away with our rotation z because I think we're gonna be using

00:24.420 --> 00:27.120
that more often than just X and Y.

00:27.130 --> 00:33.410
Now disease is gonna work like let's say first we're gonna be looking for transformation and we're working

00:33.410 --> 00:34.850
here with the second one I believe right.

00:34.860 --> 00:40.920
That was the green one and then we have rotate and then we're looking for to see now the way this is

00:40.920 --> 00:41.600
gonna work.

00:41.670 --> 00:47.640
If we were gonna write some kind of degrees let's say 45 degrees this is gonna be the easiest one to

00:47.640 --> 00:51.730
see because this is gonna be rotated right now on the z axis.

00:51.810 --> 00:53.870
Very straightforward very simple.

00:53.910 --> 00:59.720
So if I'm gonna say a hundred and eighty nine this is I was going to move on lady and this is obviously

00:59.840 --> 01:05.730
going to be exactly the same like we had before but let's say if we would want to I don't know go with

01:06.090 --> 01:08.520
hundred and thirty five.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.760
Then again this is gonna look exactly like the forty four.

01:11.940 --> 01:18.550
You get an idea we have 360 degrees and then we can rotate the element however light.

01:18.850 --> 01:22.350
Now this is gonna go with x axis and y axis.

01:22.380 --> 01:29.660
So here you have a transform are you know what before we actually cover the x and y axis we also want

01:29.660 --> 01:31.980
to say that this is gonna be exactly the same.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.060
So if so then let's say copy and paste it.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.680
The red one and change it around too.

01:37.910 --> 01:40.790
I don't know three hundred and forty.

01:40.800 --> 01:45.890
We're gonna get some kind of rotation because this would be the shorthand so we don't have to type.

01:45.900 --> 01:51.360
We can just say okay rotate and both of them would mean exactly the same thing huh.

01:51.380 --> 01:51.570
Yeah.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.390
And that is just going to be side note.

01:53.450 --> 01:54.880
Hopefully you get that.

01:54.890 --> 02:01.400
And then last but not least we're gonna be looking at both of them the x and y and here out one transform

02:01.960 --> 02:03.570
that I'm looking for.

02:03.620 --> 02:09.860
Like I said already rotation and full rotation I'm looking for the x value and this keeps you from getting

02:09.860 --> 02:11.860
a little let's say 20 degrees.

02:12.050 --> 02:19.520
Like I said this is gonna be hard to see because what I'm doing as I'm rotating this x direction or

02:19.640 --> 02:24.740
if I'm telling you then this is gonna be nine degrees we're not gonna be able to see that because if

02:24.740 --> 02:32.140
we're looking at the X plain light right now we have rotated this exactly nine degrees and this is gonna

02:32.150 --> 02:32.930
be hard to see.

02:33.410 --> 02:40.160
Now we can also do the same thing let's say here comment is out and we're gonna do the y direction so

02:40.190 --> 02:49.090
let's do trends and then rotate y direction and again this is gonna work exactly the same where let's

02:49.100 --> 02:51.850
say 20 degrees it is gonna rotated.

02:51.950 --> 02:57.260
So this is gonna be a little bit small at this moment already y direction because previously remember

02:57.350 --> 03:02.150
it got smaller in the x axis because we were flipping it around the x axis.

03:02.270 --> 03:04.980
Now we're flipping it around the y axis.

03:05.030 --> 03:08.430
So this is the reason why 20 degrees is gonna make this smaller here.

03:08.490 --> 03:15.110
Now I'm going to go 40 degrees and this is gonna get even smaller 68 degrees is going to something like

03:15.110 --> 03:22.130
this even smaller and then finally again if I want to flip it around I can do 90 degrees and then my

03:22.130 --> 03:27.650
actual element is gonna totally disappear right now because we have rotated this 90 degrees.
