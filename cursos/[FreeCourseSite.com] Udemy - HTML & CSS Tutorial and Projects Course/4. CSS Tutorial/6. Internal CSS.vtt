I know what some of you are probably thinking Ok smart guy.

00:04.650 --> 00:10.290
You just show us how to use inline CSX assess and then spend the next five minutes trashing it.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.030
So what is the better option.

00:12.030 --> 00:13.920
Well we have the internal yes.

00:14.610 --> 00:17.830
So first of all let me get rid of these style attribute.

00:17.910 --> 00:22.160
I'm not going to need right now and let's say there's going to be having one and just for kicks.

00:22.170 --> 00:27.630
Let's add a few more let's say that I'm gonna have three helo worlds with having one and then I was

00:27.630 --> 00:32.790
just gonna have one lonely one day heading to you know how do we add the internal CSF.

00:33.180 --> 00:37.440
Well we're going to have to head over to the head tags and again that is important.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.260
Please don't place them somewhere else and then expect them to work.

00:40.770 --> 00:45.080
And then within the head tags we would need to create another tag.

00:45.090 --> 00:46.890
Now that tag would be the style tag.

00:47.430 --> 00:53.640
So again we're gonna create two sets of tags the starting one and the closing one and then we write

00:53.640 --> 00:55.850
our CSF within these tax.

00:55.860 --> 00:56.760
Now how that would work.

00:57.890 --> 01:03.300
Again we're going to start with the selector and again please don't hang up right now on the syntax.

01:03.450 --> 01:06.650
We're going to cover it literally in a few videos.

01:06.650 --> 01:09.010
Well let's say I want to start with all the heading ones.

01:09.490 --> 01:12.780
So I'm going to say all the heading ones are gonna have some kind of style.

01:12.920 --> 01:18.290
Now again like I said I was gonna go with color because that is just gonna be the easier one and let's

01:18.290 --> 01:19.400
just go with blue.

01:19.850 --> 01:24.300
So my color is gonna be blue as well as I would like to add font size.

01:24.340 --> 01:27.260
And again let's go with something like three areas.

01:27.260 --> 01:28.790
So I noticed something else.

01:28.790 --> 01:35.450
Now I don't have to jump back and forth with my email and add for every kind of style and that way all

01:35.450 --> 01:38.050
of my heading ones have been styled right.

01:38.130 --> 01:44.870
With literally like what one two three and four lines of code and I can add whatever styles I would

01:44.870 --> 01:50.900
like oh here and all my heading ones are gonna be style if I have one heading to I can just say having

01:50.900 --> 01:54.220
two and then let's say again we're going to use color.

01:54.380 --> 01:58.370
Color is gonna be red and not red Olive but actually red.

01:58.370 --> 02:01.020
And let's add font size to be really small.

02:01.900 --> 02:02.700
Uh.

02:02.720 --> 02:06.770
That would be a don't no zero point five volumes something like this.

02:06.770 --> 02:10.940
So now my heading to is gonna be very small.

02:10.940 --> 02:12.200
We have color red.

02:12.350 --> 02:16.580
And if I'm gonna have more heading choose the same thing is gonna happen to them.

02:16.640 --> 02:22.820
And again you can see how much more powerful this is already because we don't have to first of all clog

02:22.820 --> 02:24.240
up outrageously amount.

02:24.260 --> 02:26.190
So I didn't need to add anything here.

02:26.210 --> 02:32.630
I can clearly see what kind of structure I have as well as the all the changes we're making are gonna

02:32.630 --> 02:34.790
be instantly added to all of them.

02:34.790 --> 02:39.320
Now let's say I'm gonna change my mind I'm going to say you know what I don't like the color blue so

02:39.320 --> 02:41.350
let's say we're going to go with chocolate.

02:41.960 --> 02:45.720
So instantly all my heading ones are going to get this done.

02:45.950 --> 02:53.440
So internal says is way way more powerful than jumping throughout the actual components that we have.

02:53.450 --> 02:54.760
I'm sorry not components.

02:54.920 --> 02:59.450
The elements that we have an HMO and adding them the inline styles.
