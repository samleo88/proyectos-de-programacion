00:00.390 --> 00:06.450
Hey guys before we deep dive into CSX I would like to show you my extensions and workspace settings

00:06.510 --> 00:07.740
in the Visual Studio.

00:08.730 --> 00:14.760
If you're just joining us you don't have to use Visual Studio code in order to follow this course or

00:14.760 --> 00:20.520
even if you are using Visual Studio code you can skip this video and use the setup that makes sense

00:20.520 --> 00:21.470
to you.

00:21.470 --> 00:26.290
However just to show you what is my setup let me spend a few minutes on that.

00:26.490 --> 00:32.070
Now first and foremost I would like to show you a few extensions that I'm using and for this example

00:32.070 --> 00:33.730
I'm going to use the main CSF.

00:33.750 --> 00:38.700
Now obviously we haven't covered yet anything to do with SPSS but what I'm about to show you is just

00:38.910 --> 00:43.860
a little visual thing so I don't think we need to cover what is the assess in order to understand.

00:44.550 --> 00:48.200
Now as you notice these are extensions that I'm using right now.

00:48.270 --> 00:55.410
And if you're just joining us then please head over to previous videos where we talk model live server

00:55.500 --> 01:00.210
installation as well as the prior year if you don't have them already.

01:00.240 --> 01:04.090
Now the first extension that I would like to show you is a bracket per calories.

01:04.440 --> 01:10.530
Now as you can see right now these brackets are pretty much white so there's no distinction in between

01:10.530 --> 01:11.180
them.

01:11.180 --> 01:16.250
I or if we install this extension the same bracket here.

01:16.260 --> 01:21.310
So here we are searching for extensions and we should have the brackets per colonizer.

01:21.350 --> 01:27.170
Now again the only thing we need to do is right now a click install and the extension is available to

01:27.170 --> 01:27.820
us.

01:27.860 --> 01:29.490
Now what bracket better color is.

01:29.510 --> 01:32.790
Does it colorized is the matching bracket.

01:32.890 --> 01:39.770
Now in our case obviously our example is very simple where we just had two sets of brackets and maybe

01:39.860 --> 01:42.720
in the projects or whatever sections we going to be worth.

01:42.730 --> 01:49.460
Now it will not gonna make as much sense as later on as you're progressing with web development however

01:49.490 --> 01:50.550
this is very neat.

01:50.570 --> 01:56.510
Whenever you start working again with large chunks of code where you can at least see what is happening

01:56.630 --> 01:58.460
and understand a little bit more visually.

01:59.020 --> 02:03.540
So that would be the first one and then let's look at the indent rainbow.

02:03.710 --> 02:09.610
Let me just delete this in brackets per colorized or let's say indent rainbow.

02:10.070 --> 02:14.480
And again this will going to make indentation easier to read.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.580
Now how we can see that in real life.

02:16.580 --> 02:21.200
So first of all it's installed as you can see right now it's installed and if I'm gonna head over back

02:21.200 --> 02:25.340
to indexation you will notice that I'm going to have these indentations.

02:25.340 --> 02:29.080
So this pretty much shows us of what code block we're working.

02:29.690 --> 02:34.580
So everything within the body is going to have this indentation on the left hand side.

02:34.580 --> 02:43.840
Now last one is going to be highlight matching tag so again in the lead this let's say highlight matching

02:43.840 --> 02:47.420
and there's gonna be a lot of them so we kind of need to be very specific.

02:47.820 --> 02:49.990
And in this case this would be the name.

02:49.990 --> 02:55.690
Now what's really neat about this extension is again this is going to highlight the matching closing

02:55.750 --> 02:58.580
and opening tax and getting all the names installed it.

02:58.870 --> 03:02.040
For this one we're going to do a little bit of extra setup.

03:02.130 --> 03:07.300
So again let me first say I would make sure that it's here and what's gonna happen is as I click again

03:07.300 --> 03:11.090
on some kind of element it's going to highlight the beginning and the closing tab.

03:11.740 --> 03:14.950
However we're gonna add a little bit of more settings.

03:15.100 --> 03:20.230
So let me scroll down and as you notice here there's gonna be more options now in our case.

03:20.230 --> 03:25.060
First of all I would like to sit like this and then in here you would need to use again the edit.

03:25.420 --> 03:30.190
So we're gonna use the copy so we're gonna copy everything that's right here and we're gonna head over

03:30.190 --> 03:31.750
to our setting.

03:31.840 --> 03:37.000
So we're gonna do settings the cog the settings where we're all gonna be looking for the adjacent object.

03:37.090 --> 03:42.190
And right after a let's say false let's just copy and paste so in our case.

03:42.190 --> 03:43.910
Now this would be the setting.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.440
And here I would like to change this a little bit around.

03:46.840 --> 03:52.570
So I'm going to say that the border with is going to be three pixels the border style is instead of

03:52.780 --> 03:58.780
dot it is gonna be solid red solid and I'm also gonna change the color.

03:59.320 --> 04:03.270
I'm going to say that color is going to be yellow and you can pick a red.

04:03.280 --> 04:06.450
You can pick blue whatever you would like and then border raises.

04:06.450 --> 04:10.910
It's still gonna be five now the same thing is going to go here.

04:10.940 --> 04:13.330
I'm going to say three pixels first of all.

04:13.400 --> 04:20.250
Then again we're looking for solid style as well as last but not least a color should be here.

04:20.900 --> 04:25.100
So this is just gonna be a little bit more distinctive of what I had before.

04:25.100 --> 04:28.760
So again let me head over back to indexation memo and now check it out.

04:29.120 --> 04:32.750
So now I like how these tags are styled this way.

04:32.990 --> 04:33.820
Is that way.

04:34.370 --> 04:38.030
Really clearly shows me of where I'm working now.

04:38.090 --> 04:41.960
Again this is not going to make sense in our very very basic project.

04:42.200 --> 04:47.840
But as we're working with more extensive projects this is gonna save us many many times while we're

04:47.840 --> 04:48.650
still on the subject.

04:48.680 --> 04:52.350
Let me just show you the general settings that I have in my text here.

04:52.640 --> 04:57.680
First I have the windows zoom level but I was and this is gonna change whether I'm gonna be zooming

04:57.680 --> 04:58.880
in or zooming out.

04:59.420 --> 05:04.200
Then the editor font size I have on 26 the tab size would be 1.

05:04.250 --> 05:05.720
And again tab size is right here.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.340
This would be the tab size.

05:07.340 --> 05:11.090
And again if you would want it more you can obviously have two or four.

05:11.090 --> 05:12.240
It's really up to you.

05:12.500 --> 05:18.290
Then I do have the auto save off so that would be all here remember as we're working with life server

05:18.560 --> 05:20.880
we're going to have the auto site everything.

05:20.990 --> 05:24.280
What we going to be writing is gonna be saved and shown.

05:24.310 --> 05:28.370
Write it right there and then I do have the war wrap on.

05:28.370 --> 05:32.140
So that way my lines are not gonna be extending so I don't have to scroll.

05:32.140 --> 05:37.970
And then two settings that I have with the printer where I have a format on paste and format on site.

05:38.570 --> 05:44.330
So every time we're all gonna be saving then the whole code is gonna be formatted.

05:44.330 --> 05:47.920
Now I also have the mini map enabled to false.

05:48.020 --> 05:50.250
So basically I don't have this little mini map.

05:50.330 --> 05:52.460
And again this is really up to you.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.790
You want to keep the mini map you can keep it.

05:54.930 --> 05:55.820
You want to get rid of it.

05:55.820 --> 05:57.510
Just set it equal to the force.

05:57.950 --> 06:03.110
And if you'd like to look at the other settings let's say remember that you have this option or here

06:03.110 --> 06:04.250
where you can search for them.

06:04.640 --> 06:10.190
And once you find them you can actually change it let's say font size do something bigger or smaller.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.980
And then I say this is gonna be displayed here in your Jason settings.

06:14.060 --> 06:20.120
Now you can also work right away here in Jason settings but this obviously gives you a nice graphical

06:20.120 --> 06:20.660
interface.
