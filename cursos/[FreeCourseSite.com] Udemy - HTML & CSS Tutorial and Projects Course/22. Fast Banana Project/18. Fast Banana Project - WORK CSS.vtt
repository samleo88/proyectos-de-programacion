WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:07.470
Let's go to our main success rate let's create a new rules here this this let's say that this is going

00:07.470 --> 00:09.570
to be the work section we're here.

00:09.640 --> 00:15.690
We're going to do this with hashtags so work or hear more hashtags on we're hearing this.

00:16.020 --> 00:21.620
Then once we have it we're going to say stack and work and I'm going to say title right.

00:21.630 --> 00:25.170
Because the first things first I'd actually want to have a title differently.

00:25.200 --> 00:25.740
Right.

00:25.770 --> 00:27.890
You can see that slant is going this way.

00:28.020 --> 00:29.940
So it actually would want to flip it.

00:29.940 --> 00:34.930
So what I'm going to say over here since this was X marks this makes it very easy.

00:34.930 --> 00:40.460
We're going to say flex direction we're going to say roll and reverse it.

00:40.460 --> 00:43.430
So we have to do pretty much to flip it around.

00:43.530 --> 00:47.240
Then after that we're going to have a margin with the same margin top.

00:47.290 --> 00:49.300
We're just going to push an apple up right.

00:49.380 --> 00:52.790
We're going to give it a negative 20 pixels.

00:53.280 --> 00:57.170
Then after that we would want to have few changes right.

00:57.260 --> 01:02.100
First of all we want the bird border more here than we would want to change the margins and paddings

01:02.100 --> 01:06.890
So let's go one by one and let's actually add them before that.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.530
Let's add some more room.

01:08.610 --> 01:14.790
So here's what I'm going to say that this is going to be a hash tag work and we're going to have a title

01:15.450 --> 01:20.080
icon here and we'll get our fun thoughts I might come on here like this.

01:20.310 --> 01:23.960
Then we're going to see margin and margin right zero.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.410
So what I want I want to get rid of this marginal area.

01:26.460 --> 01:26.920
Right.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.320
So I'm going to say margin right.

01:29.370 --> 01:31.070
And I'm going to say zero.

01:31.070 --> 01:34.550
Now you can see the margin here but now I want to put it over here.

01:34.620 --> 01:36.050
So we're going to say we're here.

01:36.110 --> 01:37.970
Margin left.

01:38.150 --> 01:41.100
We're going out and pixels like this.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.730
Then what we would want is to work with a text.

01:44.850 --> 01:45.430
Right.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.320
So let's go back over here.

01:47.360 --> 01:54.860
We're going to say that this is going to be work work or here and then we're going to say title and

01:54.870 --> 02:00.030
text and what we would want to order here we would want a padding.

02:00.240 --> 02:04.630
And I'm going to say padding left and we're going to say zero.

02:04.740 --> 02:05.210
Right.

02:05.380 --> 02:07.890
And I can see I got rid of this back.

02:08.130 --> 02:09.450
We don't need it anymore.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.340
I don't know we're here what are we're going to say padding right then.

02:12.420 --> 02:12.960
Right.

02:12.990 --> 02:16.780
So we're going to say padding right 10 pixels.

02:16.780 --> 02:23.820
And so now we pushed it away or here and then we're going to say border and border right here.

02:23.850 --> 02:24.550
Right.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.580
And this is going to be three pixels solid.

02:28.770 --> 02:34.750
And this is going to be hash tag B 5 C B.

02:35.070 --> 02:37.810
And then we have a four here seven.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.640
And I actually missed something right.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.410
I think I in store here.

02:41.550 --> 02:45.390
So this is going to be over here right now we have the caller and we're left.

02:45.390 --> 02:46.800
We need to get rid of it.

02:47.070 --> 02:48.620
So we don't need this border.

02:48.990 --> 02:56.840
So what we're going to say something here I want to say borderer left and we're going to send That's

02:57.180 --> 02:57.530
it.

02:57.570 --> 02:58.950
Now it's gone.

02:58.950 --> 03:02.990
Now we want a remember when we had this give.

03:03.250 --> 03:03.440
Right.

03:03.450 --> 03:07.150
This was the parent for all of them right work center.

03:07.210 --> 03:09.440
Right now we need to work with this guy Llobet.

03:09.660 --> 03:15.250
So we're going to say we're here that we would want a glass work center.

03:15.460 --> 03:22.740
What we would want first we want a padding top bottom 40 pixels right here like this and we're going

03:22.740 --> 03:23.730
to say zero.

03:23.940 --> 03:24.190
Right.

03:24.210 --> 03:25.640
Because it's only top bottom.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.620
So the site is going to be zero.

03:27.900 --> 03:35.130
Then what we want is Max with Again it's all going to go with Max with and Max with is going to be 90

03:35.460 --> 03:41.310
percent this and over here we're going to see margin and margin we're going to say this is going to

03:41.310 --> 03:44.170
be zero auto or like this.

03:44.390 --> 03:44.920
Right.

03:44.970 --> 03:49.410
So again what's happening right now is that images are not style.

03:49.430 --> 03:49.660
Right.

03:49.670 --> 03:50.660
That's what it looks like.

03:50.670 --> 03:51.170
That's right.

03:51.330 --> 03:52.850
But we're going to get there don't worry about it.

03:52.860 --> 03:55.870
Actually image is the next one we're working on.

03:55.880 --> 03:59.210
Now we're going to say work image here.

03:59.250 --> 04:07.110
First things first I'm going to say this play you say block then we're going to say with 100 percent

04:07.510 --> 04:08.950
right to the response.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.630
And right away we got them and just like looking like this.

04:11.710 --> 04:18.400
And then what we would want a border going to Syria is 10 pixels.

04:18.530 --> 04:19.070
Right.

04:19.110 --> 04:24.610
So you can see we're going to make these entries and then we're going to have a border and we're going

04:24.610 --> 04:33.780
to say three pixels solid and we're going to say again F F and C 9 1 for like this.

04:33.790 --> 04:34.260
Right.

04:34.330 --> 04:36.360
So now we added a yellow border.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.360
Now we cannot see it.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.020
We haven't added any more.

04:39.080 --> 04:39.890
All right.

04:40.160 --> 04:45.560
Now what we would do right now would work with a button group.

04:45.560 --> 04:46.090
Right.

04:46.180 --> 04:49.650
So what I'm going to say is or you see this modern group.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.180
This is what we're interested in these guys.

04:52.410 --> 04:53.280
So I'm going to say we're here.

04:53.280 --> 04:57.860
Class button and or you say group here.

04:58.180 --> 05:03.130
And then we're going to have a pairing and the batting is going to be zero top zero.

05:03.150 --> 05:03.820
Right.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.570
Forty pixels bottom here and zero here.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.780
Then we're going to have a display.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.590
This is going to be flex.

05:12.730 --> 05:20.180
So I line them up in the flex then or hear what I'm going to say that this is going to be a flex ramp.

05:20.320 --> 05:20.780
Right.

05:20.860 --> 05:27.060
Once the screen is going to get smaller they can actually wrap not shrink wrap.

05:27.070 --> 05:33.340
This is going to be set equal to wrap around this and then we're going to have a justified content center.

05:33.670 --> 05:36.780
Right now I can see that actually place them in the center.

05:36.790 --> 05:39.140
Now let's work with the actual buttons.

05:39.230 --> 05:39.670
Right.

05:39.790 --> 05:40.910
So here button.

05:41.230 --> 05:48.010
And when I say group and once we have a class selection of button group that's red button here.

05:48.010 --> 05:51.610
And again what we want with the buttons display.

05:51.610 --> 05:52.630
Inline block.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.010
First things first on here like this.

05:55.270 --> 06:00.240
Then putting 10 pixels over here and 20 pixels or here.

06:00.500 --> 06:00.710
Right.

06:00.730 --> 06:04.820
So batting like this then we're going to have a font size here.

06:05.020 --> 06:08.230
It's going to be 25 pixels like this.

06:08.230 --> 06:09.940
And then we'll have a margin.

06:09.940 --> 06:14.770
Margins are going to be 10 pixels we're reading this right some modules are going to be all around all

06:14.770 --> 06:17.720
around and then we're going to have a border.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.590
We're going to say reduce.

06:19.870 --> 06:21.740
And this is going to be five pixels.

06:21.790 --> 06:28.940
So again we're going to make the radius around and then we're going to say text transform and you're

06:28.940 --> 06:34.310
going to have a uppercase like this then we're going to have a caller.

06:34.370 --> 06:43.250
So we're going to have a hashtag at 5 3 EF 5 like this and this is going to be a white color and then

06:43.250 --> 06:48.020
we're get to the background and the background is going to be hash tag 0 0.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.680
And this is going to be seven.

06:50.930 --> 06:52.470
Each one right.

06:52.520 --> 06:55.660
So this is going to be the blue color again that we are going to be using.

06:55.760 --> 06:59.250
Now remember when we had a article.

06:59.280 --> 06:59.950
Right.

06:59.990 --> 07:02.430
Number two is great picture item.

07:02.490 --> 07:02.890
Right.

07:03.070 --> 07:04.780
Was going actually styled this guy.

07:04.850 --> 07:12.030
So first we're going to say is class picture item and what we're going to say we're here to with it

07:12.400 --> 07:14.080
is going to be what calque.

07:14.170 --> 07:18.440
Right we're going to use a method to rewrite this function.

07:18.560 --> 07:25.160
We're going to say 50 percent we're like this minus 20 pixels or here right.

07:25.170 --> 07:32.310
So basically what I'm saying or here is I would want a with to be 50 percent minus 20 pixels Oria.

07:32.340 --> 07:32.820
All right.

07:33.080 --> 07:37.670
So we're going to have it like this and then we're going to have a margin and the margin we're going

07:37.670 --> 07:39.780
to say we're here is going to be 10 pixels.

07:39.950 --> 07:46.630
And then once we have here the picture at home I just do a media screen media screen.

07:46.840 --> 07:53.360
And I don't say hand and here we're going to say men with an hour here we're going to have a nine nine

07:53.960 --> 07:55.070
two pixels right.

07:55.070 --> 07:56.420
Nine hundred ninety two.

07:56.460 --> 08:04.320
No we're going to say it's going to be picture item here and then we're going to say with and now we're

08:04.320 --> 08:05.220
going to change the width.

08:05.230 --> 08:05.800
Right.

08:05.820 --> 08:12.270
So with that going to we're going to do calque or here Kelk and then we're going to say 25 percent of

08:12.270 --> 08:16.670
what you say 25 percent minus 20 pixels wide.

08:16.710 --> 08:18.730
So that's going to be the gap in between.

08:19.130 --> 08:25.200
So now we save this on here and we're going to go back over here and recording we're going to refresh.

08:25.200 --> 08:25.690
Right.

08:25.890 --> 08:29.790
And now would we would want to do is actually add the ice it talk to our project.
