WEBVTT

00:01.390 --> 00:05.010
And the next section we're going to be creating art here is going to be the fourth section.

00:05.050 --> 00:08.530
And so we are in the professionals and contact us right.

00:08.730 --> 00:12.780
So we go back over here to the next actually a mouse crawled away to the bottom.

00:12.880 --> 00:13.450
Right.

00:13.480 --> 00:21.910
So are you going to say this is going to be the end of an essay project section right projects section

00:22.400 --> 00:23.320
on this.

00:23.530 --> 00:29.840
And then we're going to write and this is going to be filler section or your filler section.

00:30.100 --> 00:37.300
Right and copy and paste this guy whole thing and we're going to say and of and of Us section I don't

00:37.720 --> 00:43.030
know whether we're going to write and this is going to be a section section or here we're going to say

00:43.030 --> 00:49.960
this is going to be a D and this is going to be filler and we're going to call it filler contact like

00:50.080 --> 00:56.860
this and then to have a heading one or here like this and we're going to say we are professionals we

00:56.950 --> 01:02.560
are here are professionals on us.

01:02.710 --> 01:06.470
If only I could just write professionals that would make me really professional.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.810
And here we're going to have a red zoom button and this is going to be type type and button.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.500
And then we're going to have contact us.

01:17.500 --> 01:22.180
You can contact us right so we have.

01:22.180 --> 01:25.580
We are professionals and we we have contact us.

01:25.720 --> 01:26.270
Right.

01:26.350 --> 01:33.150
So we go back to main see assess here we're going to write and this is going to be a few hours.

01:33.610 --> 01:37.070
All right so filler filler contact right.

01:37.140 --> 01:42.110
So really we're just going to say this is going to be filler contact section.

01:42.220 --> 01:42.990
All right.

01:43.000 --> 01:50.100
So we go here and the bottom and let's say we're going to say that first we want to get them back right.

01:50.210 --> 01:51.680
So we are and we know the drill.

01:51.680 --> 01:57.050
We can just go out and actually get ready with a linear background right.

01:57.050 --> 02:01.090
So we just find it somewhere where we already have a linear gradient.

02:01.130 --> 02:01.550
Right.

02:01.730 --> 02:04.820
So we don't need to start everything from scratch.

02:05.060 --> 02:09.280
So I'm going to grab this guy and we're just going to copy this one.

02:09.320 --> 02:14.060
And actually we can use it in our advantage right because the flags boxes also set up.

02:14.060 --> 02:14.560
All right.

02:14.720 --> 02:23.700
So if I right over here this is going to be filler contact here and say I'm going to delete this and

02:24.110 --> 02:25.520
copy and paste this.

02:25.640 --> 02:25.920
Right.

02:25.970 --> 02:30.950
And you can see that I needed my brackets on here and you're right and I was going to happen is that

02:31.160 --> 02:32.960
right away I already set up right.

02:33.110 --> 02:36.740
So filler contact is exactly like we want right now.

02:36.770 --> 02:39.910
There's few things that we don't want which is minimal height.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.330
We don't want any.

02:41.400 --> 02:41.640
Right.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.410
Well actually going to use the padding.

02:43.460 --> 02:43.920
Right.

02:44.010 --> 02:48.780
And you can see that we're here just if I can that maybe also we're not going to use the same one.

02:48.870 --> 02:56.000
Let's just say this is going to be a space between right and we don't mean center I mean because this

02:56.000 --> 02:57.540
is going to be very minimal.

02:57.540 --> 02:57.890
Right.

02:58.040 --> 03:01.530
So now that this set up is then let's add a few more hours.

03:01.550 --> 03:06.070
Right here we're going to say that this is going to be a flex wrap.

03:06.080 --> 03:11.540
First of all right because we want on the smaller screens for them to wrap like this.

03:11.540 --> 03:15.420
And then we're going to have a this padding.

03:15.740 --> 03:18.840
We're going to say 60 pixels are going around right.

03:18.860 --> 03:20.070
So something like this.

03:20.240 --> 03:27.320
And then we're also over one is actually line items not not center which is deleted.

03:27.320 --> 03:31.970
We're going to see a line items I don't want to say baseline right because there's going to be a difference.

03:31.970 --> 03:35.270
The button is going to be bigger and the text is going to be smaller.

03:35.270 --> 03:39.840
So we only want it actually to line up of where the text is.

03:39.920 --> 03:40.450
Right.

03:40.580 --> 03:48.170
So then let's start styling or here we have a filler and we're going to have filler contact and heading

03:48.170 --> 03:49.370
one way.

03:49.570 --> 03:58.470
And what should happen is font size we're going to say 30 pixels then we're going to have a text transform.

03:58.480 --> 04:04.060
And this is going to be to uppercase then we're going to have a color.

04:04.210 --> 04:08.640
And so this is going to be hash tag of e 0 e.

04:08.930 --> 04:12.600
And then going up to the B to the B.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.360
And then the next one will have a button.

04:16.540 --> 04:26.390
All right so when I say a filter contact hear here button and then what we're all going to say is this

04:26.390 --> 04:34.580
is going to be font size and that's going to be 30 pixels will have a text transform that's going to

04:34.580 --> 04:37.450
be also 30 right.

04:37.460 --> 04:43.080
I'm sort of apprecate text transform uppercase.

04:43.880 --> 04:46.850
Then once we're done with uppercase we would want a color.

04:46.940 --> 04:56.330
And again we're going to use hash tag e 6 A and E F to like this.

04:56.460 --> 05:03.440
Then we're going to have a border war over here like this and we're going to say this is going to be

05:03.500 --> 05:11.870
a toothpick So to pick so solid and then we're going to have a again the yellow one right.

05:11.870 --> 05:23.410
So I just grabbed this guy over here and pasted this right then we're going to have a padding and pixels.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.190
And this is going to be 15 pixels.

05:26.190 --> 05:26.390
Right.

05:26.390 --> 05:29.150
So two things on this.

05:29.240 --> 05:32.260
And the background is going to be transparent and so background.

05:32.330 --> 05:36.530
And we can just say and this is going to be transparent like this.

05:36.530 --> 05:43.310
Now what we would want to do is maybe create a little bit of margin so we can read or here whether with

05:43.430 --> 05:44.660
a Heading 1.

05:44.850 --> 05:50.840
Right so I can maybe see margin and maybe say margin bottom say like 20 pixels.

05:50.850 --> 05:51.220
Right.

05:51.370 --> 05:52.720
And let's say 10.

05:52.900 --> 05:58.240
I'm just a small margin in the bottom and over here what we would want the last is actually has been

05:58.250 --> 05:59.440
hovering.

05:59.510 --> 06:08.050
So we go here and we just copy this copy right.

06:08.150 --> 06:13.820
And what should happen is background right and background is going to be yellow and the color is going

06:13.820 --> 06:14.790
to be black.

06:15.170 --> 06:16.430
So here we go with the

06:19.370 --> 06:27.120
copy paste and then color hash tag 1 9 1 7 1 6 right.

06:27.170 --> 06:33.160
So now we have this everything is ready set up and we actually can go here and check it out.

06:33.170 --> 06:34.500
It looks like.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.070
So that's the goal here.

06:36.140 --> 06:38.790
And we obviously would need to change the image right.

06:38.810 --> 06:42.240
So we go back over here and we will have a different image.

06:42.260 --> 06:43.990
This would be filler image right.

06:44.270 --> 06:46.720
So let's go back over here.

06:46.950 --> 06:52.360
I'm just going to write this is going to be a filler image and let's say this and let's check it out.

06:52.390 --> 06:53.100
Right.

06:53.150 --> 06:58.180
And you can see I actually didn't find filler image which was probably JP Right.

06:58.200 --> 07:05.030
Or you know like this I say this and you can see that now have image and you can see what this line

07:05.030 --> 07:06.110
item is baseline.

07:06.190 --> 07:06.730
Right.

07:06.740 --> 07:10.470
So it's it's a lining where the text is right.

07:10.580 --> 07:13.560
So it doesn't carry an actual button is bigger.

07:13.560 --> 07:13.820
Right.

07:13.820 --> 07:18.530
It's a lining where it takes this and you can see for centering where I actually use the padding right.

07:18.560 --> 07:24.280
So if the padding is 16:16 on line items baseline right.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.060
So it's going to be exactly the same.

07:26.430 --> 07:32.430
If we got a smaller screen right the moment they start wrapping and they're going to look nice right.

07:32.420 --> 07:34.160
They're not going to be jacked up.

07:34.160 --> 07:38.700
And this is going to be for this video or here that we're in for the next section.
