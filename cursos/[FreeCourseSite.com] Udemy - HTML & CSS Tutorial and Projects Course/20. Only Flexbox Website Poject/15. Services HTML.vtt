WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:06.030
And we're back in our age email or here this is going to be the end of about Section no.

00:06.040 --> 00:10.650
Here we're going to say this is going to be services section and again right away.

00:10.650 --> 00:14.490
We can just copy online copy and paste this and all Hilborn right.

00:14.490 --> 00:21.870
This is going to be end of services section then or here we're going to create a section here with an

00:21.870 --> 00:28.920
ID and we're going to say services services and we're going to press the time and or here we're going

00:28.920 --> 00:35.610
to have a title right on the same title that we had here for the skills we're going to use it for our

00:35.610 --> 00:36.690
services.

00:36.750 --> 00:41.360
So we're going to go my core here find work the skills time and all I want to hear.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.730
All right so can you just copy and paste this.

00:43.980 --> 00:47.490
So I'm going to copy this guy and drag it over here.

00:47.490 --> 00:52.380
And once we have the services copy pasted on here skills I don't know where you're going to write right

00:52.400 --> 00:57.260
this is going to be a services services over here.

00:57.260 --> 01:04.800
So once we say this we need to actually make sure I'm closing properly or here in this market on this

01:04.860 --> 01:05.480
right.

01:05.530 --> 01:08.360
But you can see that still everything works.

01:08.610 --> 01:14.800
So if we say this right or here it will be the same thing as if I'm hovering over here right.

01:14.820 --> 01:19.530
You can see that this is still going to be turning red and it doesn't matter that we have it over here

01:19.530 --> 01:20.000
right.

01:20.010 --> 01:21.110
It would work the same way.

01:21.120 --> 01:26.730
Right now the with is going to be expanding and also the color is going to be changing then on here

01:26.730 --> 01:32.120
once we have the end of tied up they're all going to create or here a day of.

01:32.510 --> 01:37.040
And I'm going to say this is going to be did with the class of services.

01:37.340 --> 01:40.590
We're going to say Center pressed.

01:40.740 --> 01:46.890
And within the services center we're going to have another article and this guy's going to be with a

01:46.890 --> 01:54.120
class or here of service and we're going to press them and with an article first we're going to have

01:54.180 --> 01:55.060
a div.

01:55.290 --> 02:02.250
So I'm going to say this is going to be with a class of service and I can then once we have that then

02:02.250 --> 02:04.790
we're going to have the actual icon.

02:04.940 --> 02:11.880
So I'm going to say I can be far down the here this is going to be for code like this.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.830
Right so now we have the code.

02:13.830 --> 02:16.700
And after that we're going to have another day of it.

02:16.710 --> 02:23.080
So this was the first service I can then on here the next day over here is going to be actually service

02:23.080 --> 02:23.910
text.

02:24.090 --> 02:32.060
So I'm going to say we're here Service Service text here press tab and he'll going to have a heading

02:32.070 --> 02:42.020
to this with a class of service subtitle service sub title here or here or is going right.

02:42.030 --> 02:48.240
And this is going to be a clean code so I'm going to say we're here a clean code and that's going to

02:48.240 --> 02:49.390
be the text.

02:49.590 --> 02:53.840
And if we press Dybul here now we have had to go with a clean code.

02:53.880 --> 02:58.820
Then after that we're going to have a paragraph and or you are going to say this is going to be paragraph

02:58.830 --> 03:03.280
with a class service here in full.

03:03.450 --> 03:06.340
And after that we're going to have the actual paragraph.

03:06.360 --> 03:11.920
So again we're going to press the table here and here we're going to have a text.

03:11.950 --> 03:12.470
Right.

03:12.530 --> 03:18.490
So here we're going just say Lorem and let's say over here Lorem and write press tab.

03:18.550 --> 03:20.310
And now we have it over here.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.010
And I would say there's a couple of things going on right.

03:23.020 --> 03:25.440
So first of all you want them side by side.

03:25.560 --> 03:32.190
So we're going to do it actually with the help of Xbox or here obviously we would need add more.

03:32.440 --> 03:35.980
So here you just check where is actual service.

03:35.980 --> 03:36.610
Right.

03:36.620 --> 03:39.570
So this is going to be our goal here.

03:39.700 --> 03:47.080
And if it helps we can just say that this is going to be single single service here and we can just

03:47.200 --> 03:49.570
I don't know copy and paste this may be right.

03:49.600 --> 03:54.080
So here we're going to say this is going to be service we're going to copy this one.

03:54.150 --> 03:56.370
I know here are going to place it at the end.

03:56.620 --> 04:03.790
And we're going to say and of singles service singles service and now we can do is just grab this one

04:03.790 --> 04:04.420
right.

04:04.420 --> 04:10.120
So I'm going to say over here that I would want to actually copy and paste this so you know I'm going

04:10.120 --> 04:13.540
to say that I want to select these lines over here right.

04:13.630 --> 04:17.810
And then we're going to say copy and now we're going to start pasting.

04:18.060 --> 04:20.470
So I'm going to say one more time right.

04:20.530 --> 04:22.310
This is going to be the clean code.

04:22.390 --> 04:29.580
And one more time and three more times all right here at the end we should have one two three four five

04:29.590 --> 04:30.360
six.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.540
And obviously one by one.

04:32.800 --> 04:37.330
Now we would actually want to change them and the next one is going to be comment.

04:37.360 --> 04:41.240
Oh so all going to go here and find where is the night.

04:41.260 --> 04:42.650
And the second one right.

04:42.670 --> 04:45.280
So this was the cold like this.

04:45.280 --> 04:51.140
Now we need to go to the next one and the next one actually is going to be a service.

04:51.180 --> 04:51.760
Right.

04:51.820 --> 04:54.170
And that's going to be a comment.

04:54.510 --> 05:00.990
So I'm going to take a moment here and all of them say Oh so this is going to be the second one and

05:01.270 --> 05:05.380
that's actually going to say that this is going to be clean and we're going to say this is going to

05:05.380 --> 05:08.350
be clean next more here.

05:08.350 --> 05:12.450
Then after that the next one is going to be a Cold War.

05:12.760 --> 05:17.790
So we're going to find another one right where it is over here and we're going to say we're here that

05:17.800 --> 05:26.390
this is going to be a cold fork cold fork and an actual icon also is going to be called for.

05:26.390 --> 05:27.290
All right.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.940
So now we have called for it.

05:28.990 --> 05:31.300
And then we have three more to go.

05:31.360 --> 05:38.510
The next one is going to be called Pan or here going to say code code.

05:38.970 --> 05:45.550
And also the name is going to be called and this then after that we're going to have serious history

05:45.550 --> 05:46.990
in the age of five.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.560
So two of them.

05:48.580 --> 05:50.970
So again are going to look worse than the next one.

05:51.070 --> 05:54.870
Well again we're going to say see us three more here.

05:54.870 --> 06:01.030
I think there's an ordeal going on right now this is going to be as history ss.

06:01.250 --> 06:04.750
Very after that we're going to have aged him all five.

06:05.050 --> 06:12.290
So we're here you know five five and then over here age five.

06:12.580 --> 06:19.700
And now that we are ready with HD so we can go ahead and actually starts telling this in our main SS.
