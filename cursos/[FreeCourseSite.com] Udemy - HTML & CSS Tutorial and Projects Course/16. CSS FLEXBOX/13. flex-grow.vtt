00:00.330 --> 00:08.570
Next we have a flex grow property that allow us to fill out the space in our container and by default.

00:08.610 --> 00:15.270
We have all the children with a flex growth property of zero and that's the reason why you see the space

00:15.270 --> 00:15.450
here.

00:15.870 --> 00:22.370
So if let's say I'm going to make my screen size even bigger you'll notice that there's plenty of space.

00:22.390 --> 00:22.970
OK.

00:23.130 --> 00:29.550
Now the way we use this property while we have multiple ways since we have right now are box class.

00:29.550 --> 00:35.790
And again we're not targeting the container right now we're targeting the black box class that is applied

00:35.790 --> 00:38.040
to each and every day that I have.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.740
While I called selected there.

00:39.840 --> 00:46.110
I could say you know what box so all the boxes and we're going to go with Flex.

00:46.130 --> 00:55.410
Then let's look for our Flex grow so let's see where it is flex GIRL AND LET'S SET flex grow equal to

00:55.410 --> 00:55.910
one.

00:56.130 --> 01:03.260
And you're going to notice right away that our boxes in fact are filling out our container so there's

01:03.270 --> 01:10.840
not gonna be any more any kind of space in between the actual items as well as the container.

01:10.860 --> 01:17.790
So if we have let's say five items if we set flex grow equal to one while our container is gonna be

01:17.790 --> 01:18.540
filled up.

01:18.660 --> 01:25.080
Now the same is going to work even if I'm gonna go let's say two boxes just to show a more clearer how

01:25.080 --> 01:25.900
it's gonna work.

01:26.100 --> 01:33.120
Let's go for two boxes and again regardless of the screen size each and every box is going to have this

01:33.120 --> 01:39.050
flex grow my case two of them and then each of them is going to have flex growth one.

01:39.180 --> 01:45.870
And what happens right now is in fact that they are growing as much as they have to to fill out.

01:45.870 --> 01:47.880
In fact our parent container.

01:47.880 --> 01:53.760
Now the smaller the parent container is of course the smaller boxes are going to be the bigger parent

01:53.760 --> 01:57.090
container is the bigger our boxes are gonna be.

01:57.150 --> 02:01.330
Now we're not limited to just setting the flags girl for all of them.

02:01.380 --> 02:04.830
We can also manipulate the values how it's gonna work.

02:04.860 --> 02:08.720
Well first of all why don't we just comment it out like.

02:08.740 --> 02:14.970
So for both of the boxes and as you can see right away our boxes again are small because they don't

02:14.970 --> 02:21.540
have this flex grow so they're not growing to fill out the space but in let's say let's target them

02:21.570 --> 02:22.550
individually.

02:22.650 --> 02:30.870
So I could say box number one and you know the box number one is going to have a flex grow on let's

02:30.870 --> 02:32.430
set it equal to one.

02:32.430 --> 02:39.630
So now what's going to happen is the box number one is going to be growing as much as it has to to fill

02:39.630 --> 02:46.050
out the space in box number two is going to say the size of the size of the box number two is not going

02:46.050 --> 02:51.540
to change or depending on the container the box number one is going to be growing.

02:51.540 --> 02:57.960
Now the reason for that is very simple because we did set up a flex grow to be one right now.

02:57.990 --> 03:04.620
We can also manipulate our values even more where I could set up you know what for box number let's

03:04.620 --> 03:11.940
say 1 I'm going to have 2 and then let's copy and pasted and let's set box number 2 by the value of

03:11.940 --> 03:12.680
1.

03:12.750 --> 03:15.740
So it's not as big as number two correct.

03:15.780 --> 03:19.320
However it is not also zero which would be the default.

03:19.320 --> 03:25.770
So what that means is that in fact our own I'm sorry I needed to do the box number two.

03:25.830 --> 03:33.210
So that means is that I can see that my box is going to be bigger box number one than the number two

03:33.480 --> 03:39.000
but it's not gonna be all the time filling out the whole space because we're still going to keep these

03:39.000 --> 03:45.120
proportions where this is going to be let's say two times bigger than the box number one but still this

03:45.120 --> 03:47.780
box is having that flex grow of one.

03:47.970 --> 03:50.800
So it's still not sitting and just waiting.

03:50.910 --> 03:53.570
It is also helping out to fill out the space.

03:54.120 --> 03:57.640
And it's not going to change if we're going to add more boxes.

03:58.080 --> 04:04.590
I just did with two boxes because I thought it's going to show a little bit better but if I'm going

04:04.590 --> 04:11.940
to let's say select all of them notice I still have my box number one the number two and then the rest

04:11.940 --> 04:12.560
of them.

04:12.690 --> 04:19.050
And regardless how big it goes while I'm still gonna be filling up the space now that's how we can work

04:19.050 --> 04:26.130
with a flux girl property which helps us to fill out the space in the container and then depending on

04:26.130 --> 04:30.150
which values we are going to use while that's going to be our layout.
