WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:00.950
Next one up.

00:00.960 --> 00:07.200
Why don't we add more cards and set up our column layout where on the small screen and next to a small

00:07.200 --> 00:07.800
screen.

00:07.950 --> 00:14.550
We're gonna have a one column layout then we're gonna have a two column layout and then eventually we're

00:14.550 --> 00:17.080
going to have a three column layout.

00:17.250 --> 00:22.730
And of course you can set up even four or five or how many columns you would like.

00:22.740 --> 00:23.640
All right.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.610
Now let's start very simply by adding more items.

00:27.630 --> 00:28.150
All right.

00:28.290 --> 00:30.200
So we have our section center.

00:30.390 --> 00:33.530
And then within the section center we have our single card.

00:33.930 --> 00:41.280
So copy and paste everything that you have in between the single card as well as the fact that we have

00:41.280 --> 00:42.990
of course our common.

00:42.990 --> 00:46.280
So I selected everything I'm going to copy and paste it.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.920
And we're going to copy and paste it two times.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.500
So first then on the second time.

00:51.630 --> 00:55.530
Now first of all I would like to change values for my services.

00:56.040 --> 01:00.380
So the third one is not going to be a custom recipes.

01:00.510 --> 01:05.420
We're gonna write it as a t e aging.

01:05.480 --> 01:08.020
All right something like that.

01:08.290 --> 01:15.310
And then for the second one I'm going to have also different text and this is not going to be a custom

01:15.310 --> 01:22.700
recipes but in fact we're going to write a own delivery something like that.

01:22.900 --> 01:25.500
Let's say it and I do have my cards right.

01:25.500 --> 01:33.460
So I have the card for home delivery and then also 40 aging or I also would like to change the images

01:33.460 --> 01:34.600
that we have right.

01:34.970 --> 01:40.570
So for the T aging why don't we go for product number three the one that's sitting within the images

01:40.570 --> 01:46.000
folder and then card number two is going to have this image.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.670
So far so good.

01:48.670 --> 01:56.280
Now let's switch back to a style CSX and still within the services what we're going to do well we're

01:56.350 --> 01:58.220
going to set up our media queries.

01:58.300 --> 01:58.680
Right.

01:59.020 --> 02:03.650
So we're going to set up our sea assess where it's going to be responsive.

02:03.760 --> 02:09.120
So as we're changing the screen size while also our success is going to change a little bit.

02:09.190 --> 02:14.300
Currently you notice everything is going to have this one column layout.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.780
Regardless of the screen size.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.160
So how do we do that.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.460
Well we already work with the floats.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.400
Remember.

02:21.400 --> 02:30.490
So let's start by just setting up a media query so media screen and let's go for men with it's really

02:30.490 --> 02:31.140
up to you.

02:31.150 --> 02:34.170
I'm gonna start by 768.

02:34.690 --> 02:38.870
So I'm going to say starting from the screen size of 768.

02:38.950 --> 02:44.380
Well I'm gonna have some changes to my sources and the changes that I'm gonna have here are going to

02:44.380 --> 02:52.670
be service card and then let's float it all right let's say float the left and now first let's go off

02:52.670 --> 02:55.110
with our 50 percent OK.

02:55.340 --> 02:57.460
Just so we can see what would be the issue.

02:57.620 --> 03:00.880
And then second we're going to see how we can in fact fix that issue.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.630
So let's set this up.

03:02.660 --> 03:03.100
All right.

03:03.140 --> 03:04.920
I do have my 50 percent.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.460
And then of course in the bottom I have another card.

03:08.060 --> 03:11.970
Now the problem is following where it is sitting correctly.

03:11.990 --> 03:12.220
Right.

03:12.230 --> 03:14.000
So we have our hundred percent.

03:14.060 --> 03:14.990
I remember.

03:14.990 --> 03:17.680
Hundred percent is our section.

03:17.780 --> 03:25.570
I remember we had our section where we had the section center and it was responsible for the width and

03:25.600 --> 03:26.190
height.

03:26.310 --> 03:29.190
That's the reason why we had it as 80 percent.

03:29.200 --> 03:29.800
All right.

03:29.810 --> 03:35.820
And you can think of our 80 percent as 100 percent from both cards right.

03:35.840 --> 03:40.250
That's the reason when we set up in the styles with the 50 percent.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.720
Now we have a two column layout.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.600
We have one card and we have the second card.

03:45.670 --> 03:49.450
Are the problem right now is that there is no margin between.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.070
OK.

03:50.330 --> 03:58.580
And if I'm just going to add margin once a margin and we can go as little as let's say two pixels but

03:58.640 --> 04:00.750
our whole layout is going to break.

04:00.760 --> 04:01.280
All right.

04:01.400 --> 04:07.100
Now the reason why our whole layout is going to break is because we are already using a hundred percent

04:07.640 --> 04:10.400
because we have one card by 15 the other one by 50.

04:10.880 --> 04:18.360
So if we were adding let's say margin of two pixels while we are in fact outside already are 100 percent.

04:18.380 --> 04:27.170
So instead the way we are going to do that is by setting up a less with four hour column.

04:27.170 --> 04:29.360
So in this case why don't we go with 45.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.420
But it's really up to you.

04:31.490 --> 04:35.500
And then remember we have a hundred percent as our total.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.290
And by the way I can just leave the comments.

04:37.430 --> 04:39.380
So a hundred percent is our total.

04:39.440 --> 04:44.600
Now I'm using for two cards since I would like to have two column loud 45 percent.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.080
So how much is that.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.750
Well it is 90 percent correct.

04:47.750 --> 04:48.770
That's my total.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.470
So have 10 percent over.

04:50.480 --> 04:56.710
So what I could do is for each and every card I could use half of that 10 percent for my margin.

04:56.930 --> 04:57.310
So.

04:57.390 --> 04:57.650
Right.

04:57.650 --> 04:59.050
Margin.

04:59.220 --> 05:00.620
Let's go right.

05:00.620 --> 05:01.410
We can left.

05:01.460 --> 05:02.600
Doesn't really matter.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.230
And I only say 5 percent.

05:05.280 --> 05:05.880
So.

05:05.980 --> 05:06.500
Right.

05:06.620 --> 05:07.720
So now what happens.

05:07.730 --> 05:09.820
My total is 50 percent OK.

05:09.860 --> 05:13.760
Because my with is 45 and margin is using 5.

05:14.180 --> 05:20.600
So in this case I am going to have a two column loud but everything works correctly.

05:21.020 --> 05:21.570
OK.

05:21.650 --> 05:23.470
There is marching in between.

05:23.870 --> 05:27.720
And it is adding correctly not in fact breaking out loud.

05:27.770 --> 05:33.830
And then lastly I also want to do the same thing when we get to let's say nine hundred ninety two.

05:33.890 --> 05:39.440
So in order to speed this up again I'm going to select the whole media query.

05:39.620 --> 05:40.980
Let's copy and pasted.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.680
Let's change these values.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.010
Nine hundred and ninety two.

05:44.360 --> 05:50.010
So let's say starting from nine hundred ninety two pixels I would want to have a three column layout.

05:50.060 --> 05:54.590
So again we're gonna float it the left however let's change the width.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.330
Let's just change to 30 percent.

05:57.740 --> 06:04.400
Now in this case again I have three columns my total is going to be 90 percent again.

06:04.400 --> 06:07.110
But notice since I have three columns.

06:07.250 --> 06:10.750
Wow this total is going to be 15 percent.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.860
But I have a hundred percent total.

06:12.860 --> 06:17.950
So of course we just need to in fact go with a little margin so a little less margin.

06:18.050 --> 06:23.480
Now if you want bigger margin just make sure that you will also decrease the width of the particular

06:23.480 --> 06:24.210
card.

06:24.230 --> 06:28.410
So in my case I'm going to go with three point three three three three something.

06:28.490 --> 06:28.870
Right.

06:28.890 --> 06:33.050
Again my total is going to be a hundred let's say that.

06:33.050 --> 06:34.040
And sure enough.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.350
Now once I get to the bigger screen I have three column layout.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.040
If I'm gonna make my screen size smaller.

06:40.040 --> 06:44.740
Notice I'm going to get here where I have a two column layout.

06:45.080 --> 06:50.720
Then once I'm gonna get to the smaller screen size I'm going to have a one column layout and it's really

06:50.720 --> 06:51.420
up to you.

06:51.560 --> 06:58.130
If let's say you'd like to change a different media query let's say to have different column widths

06:58.520 --> 07:01.360
at the different screen sizes just change those values.

07:01.760 --> 07:05.770
If you want four columns let's say now we could do it this way.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.850
I'm just gonna copy and paste it for now.

07:07.850 --> 07:13.960
I'm going to delete it right away but if we're gonna head over to not services.

07:13.970 --> 07:17.730
Yes and of services and whereas my last card.

07:17.750 --> 07:18.020
All right.

07:18.050 --> 07:20.310
So I have this service card.

07:20.510 --> 07:26.100
Let's just grab everything and I'm going to try to apply it correctly.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.220
Let me selected.

07:28.220 --> 07:32.150
I think it's gonna be easier let's select everything.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.910
Let's copy and pasted like I said I'm going to delete it in a second.

07:35.910 --> 07:43.170
But let's say in styles instead of with of 20 or I'm of 30 percent I'm going to set it as 20 percent

07:43.290 --> 07:46.400
because currently I do have four columns.

07:46.410 --> 07:47.160
Correct.

07:47.190 --> 07:51.220
And also the margin is going to be five for each one of them.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.060
So that way I have four columns.

07:53.280 --> 07:53.900
OK.

07:54.120 --> 07:59.130
Now of course I'm going to have different heights because of different texts that we're typing.

07:59.200 --> 08:03.930
And that's one thing we would need to fix if that is going to be the scenario where right now we're

08:03.930 --> 08:05.510
using less space.

08:05.510 --> 08:05.770
OK.

08:05.790 --> 08:11.460
So since we are using less space than either we're going to have to have some kind of height already

08:11.790 --> 08:18.420
particular for this let's say the second the information or of course you could set it up a different

08:18.420 --> 08:18.930
way.

08:18.930 --> 08:19.500
All right.

08:19.530 --> 08:23.610
Now in my case I'm going to go back for 30 percent.

08:23.610 --> 08:30.870
So with this 30 percent then also let's say that as three point three three three something like that.

08:30.870 --> 08:37.710
And then lastly like I said I'm going to delete my card just remember as you're setting up for different

08:37.710 --> 08:41.670
columns you're going to have to do probably some extra work.

08:42.210 --> 08:45.130
Because your column with is going to change.

08:45.240 --> 08:51.090
So that way you need to start getting creative where in that particular media query you might need to

08:51.090 --> 08:56.270
set up some already some kind of heights for let's say sort of simple right.

08:56.550 --> 08:58.960
So all of them would be exactly the same.

08:59.040 --> 08:59.540
OK.

08:59.670 --> 09:07.560
Because as you see if your text of course changes if you're let's say in this case the text is less

09:07.590 --> 09:13.080
than we have for card one until then of course of course your layout is also going to change because

09:13.080 --> 09:14.800
you're going to start a new line.

09:14.820 --> 09:15.110
All right.

09:15.420 --> 09:18.310
But essentially it is as easy as it gets.

09:18.330 --> 09:19.930
We just set up our floats.

09:19.940 --> 09:24.460
Make sure that you calculate everything and the value is in fact a hundred.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.790
And when I say calculate everything.

09:26.790 --> 09:30.420
Also keep in mind the column with that you would like to have.

09:30.420 --> 09:32.560
There is a difference if you have three columns.

09:32.610 --> 09:34.960
Make sure that you count everything correctly.

09:35.100 --> 09:38.130
When you are adding your totals as well as with the margins.

09:38.160 --> 09:38.640
OK.

09:38.760 --> 09:44.040
So if you have two column layout then of course half of your column needs to be 50 percent then you

09:44.040 --> 09:45.230
have three column layout.

09:45.240 --> 09:51.060
Well then the third of the West needs to be for that particular column.

09:51.170 --> 09:51.450
Right.

09:51.760 --> 09:54.870
That's how we in fact set up a float layout.

09:54.870 --> 09:56.220
When we have the cards.
