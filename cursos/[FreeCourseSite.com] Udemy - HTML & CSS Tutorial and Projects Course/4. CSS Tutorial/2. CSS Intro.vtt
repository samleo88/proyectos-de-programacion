How some we made it to the CSA as part of the course.

00:04.340 --> 00:07.010
If you're just joining us welcome to the course.

00:07.070 --> 00:09.180
If you just interstate e-mail.

00:09.230 --> 00:10.610
Welcome back.

00:10.610 --> 00:14.600
As always I would like to keep slide videos short and concise.

00:14.600 --> 00:22.350
So what in the world a CSX she says stands for cascading style sheets and in one short sentence answer.

00:22.490 --> 00:30.490
CSX is used to make our web projects awesome and beautiful so you can say CSX is responsible for styling

00:30.490 --> 00:38.170
the web while the mill was responsible for what elements will be displayed CSX takes care of how elements

00:38.170 --> 00:45.790
are displayed meaning the layout and the look of the Element Y will come back to the syntax like gazillion

00:45.790 --> 00:52.210
times in the course just to get our feet wet the general CSF syntax would be followed so we're gonna

00:52.210 --> 00:55.120
have a selector so what element we would like.

00:55.120 --> 01:02.920
Style a set of curly braces that start a declaration block and within the block we're gonna have a property

01:02.920 --> 01:05.160
of the element we would like to change.

01:05.260 --> 01:11.740
So let's say the font size of the element the color or the width just to name a few and value for that

01:11.740 --> 01:12.630
property.

01:12.640 --> 01:18.430
So for example for the color we would have to choose the color we would like to apply for that element.

01:18.670 --> 01:25.720
We'll come back to it during the course but always always make sure you add semicolon between declarations.

01:25.900 --> 01:28.240
Otherwise you're gonna get a syntax error.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.940
Now that we know the theory about here says let's start using it.
