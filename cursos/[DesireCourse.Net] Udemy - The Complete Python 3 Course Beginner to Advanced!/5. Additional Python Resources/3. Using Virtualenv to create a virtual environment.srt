Hey guys, this is a quick video. What
we're gonna be doing is say we want to

2

00:00:05,879  -->  00:00:09,990
install some packages and set up one
environment that has a certain set of

3

00:00:09,990  -->  00:00:14,009
packages, but not have to install them
globally. So what we've been doing so far

4

00:00:14,009  -->  00:00:19,170
using pip is we've been globally
installing packages, so any project that

5

00:00:19,170  -->  00:00:24,240
I use I can now import simplejson as a
package, but let's say I want to set up a

6

00:00:24,240  -->  00:00:27,840
very specific environment for just one
project that I want to install a bunch

7

00:00:27,840  -->  00:00:32,910
of packages into, and we're going to be
doing that very soon, so that's why we

8

00:00:32,910  -->  00:00:36,420
need to learn about this and it's called
virtualenv. So how you get that is

9

00:00:36,420  -->  00:00:43,620
type "pip3 install virtualenv" and
I've already got it installed but if you

10

00:00:43,620  -->  00:00:47,910
guys don't, if you haven't manually
installed it, it will install it. Once it's

11

00:00:47,910  -->  00:00:48,840
installed,

12

00:00:48,840  -->  00:00:54,899
what you can do is I'm going to change
into my projects directory, and i'm going

13

00:00:54,899  -->  00:01:00,120
to create a new virtual environment. So,
what you do is just type "virtualenv"

14

00:01:00,120  -->  00:01:04,049
and then the name of the virtual
environment you want to create. So, i'm

15

00:01:04,049  -->  00:01:14,670
going to type test projects, or "testnv"
Now that we've got it

16

00:01:14,670  -->  00:01:20,610
installed, you actually need to activate
it, and you'll be able to tell if you're

17

00:01:20,610  -->  00:01:24,509
working in a virtual environment because
right here next to the prompt it would

18

00:01:24,509  -->  00:01:28,590
say the name of the virtual environment
if you're in it. So what we're going to

19

00:01:28,590  -->  00:01:37,890
do to activate it basically if I list
here you'll see testnv right here,

20

00:01:38,670  -->  00:01:46,380
so what we need to do is we need to
source a file from there "source testnv/bin/activate"

21

00:01:46,380  -->  00:01:53,790
and now as you'll see
i'm currently working in this virtual

22

00:01:53,790  -->  00:01:58,530
environment. So any package that I
install now is going to install just

23

00:01:58,530  -->  00:02:04,259
this environment, and then once I you
know if I close the terminal and open it

24

00:02:04,259  -->  00:02:08,220
again I'll be back into the global
Python environment, so if i install

25

00:02:08,220  -->  00:02:09,810
packages there,

26

00:02:09,810  -->  00:02:12,540
you know, they would be globally
accessible to this one as well.
