00:00.630 --> 00:06.480
We're almost done with transition property but in the last video I mentioned the optional transition

00:06.480 --> 00:07.980
timing property.

00:07.980 --> 00:10.200
So why don't we take a closer look.

00:10.410 --> 00:15.100
First and foremost I want to tell you that there is a lot that this particular property.

00:15.240 --> 00:20.880
And the reason why we all going to cover a bare minimum is the simple fact that at this point in time

00:21.240 --> 00:25.470
in my opinion that would be an overkill to spend more time on it.

00:25.500 --> 00:32.100
The general idea behind the property is to specifically decide how the transition is gonna take place.

00:32.430 --> 00:39.210
And just to let you know that there is a default value already of ease and that is the reason why the

00:39.240 --> 00:41.220
property is optional.

00:41.220 --> 00:43.560
Now what other values are we gonna have.

00:43.560 --> 00:49.230
Well first and foremost if you are looking at the shorthand you see that the transition timing function

00:49.680 --> 00:51.150
is going to be placed here.

00:51.180 --> 00:55.920
So first of all going to have the property that's gonna be affected there and we're going to look how

00:55.920 --> 01:01.200
long the transition is going to take place and then we have the transition timing function.

01:01.200 --> 01:06.800
Now we can write it separately and during the example we're going to look at both ways but right away

01:06.800 --> 01:11.160
I just let you know that in the shorthand this is going to be placed here.

01:11.380 --> 01:14.310
And like I said these value is gonna be default.

01:14.530 --> 01:16.560
And that's the reason why it's option.

01:16.560 --> 01:22.260
And as we're looking at these values these one would be slow start then this is going to go fast and

01:22.320 --> 01:25.270
slow and then we also have the linear.

01:25.320 --> 01:30.450
So that would be the same speed as well as we are looking at easing and ease out.

01:30.450 --> 01:32.270
So a slow start and slow.

01:32.480 --> 01:38.010
And then last but not least we would have the ease in and out now like I said this is just gonna make

01:38.010 --> 01:41.010
a little bit more sense as we're looking with an example.

01:41.010 --> 01:45.130
And you know what I will going to do a redo the actual indexation AML.

01:45.240 --> 01:50.460
So first of all let me get rid of these divs as well as we're going to clean up a little bit of success

01:50.940 --> 01:56.640
because I would like to restructure it a little bit and let's say within the indexation AML I would

01:56.640 --> 02:03.060
like to start by creating a div then there is obviously going to have a class now the default class

02:03.120 --> 02:04.290
is going to be the first one.

02:04.310 --> 02:09.920
So I'm going to say default and let's write maybe also the text here that I would like to create another

02:09.920 --> 02:10.850
one.

02:11.010 --> 02:13.250
And in general we're going to create six of them.

02:13.320 --> 02:18.270
Now I know and this might be a little bit annoying but since I would like to show you how they would

02:18.270 --> 02:23.850
work we're just gonna have to go along with it and we're going to copy and paste it then we're looking

02:23.850 --> 02:27.490
at linear linear timing function.

02:27.660 --> 02:31.880
Also we have easy in and out ease in and out or you know what.

02:31.890 --> 02:35.380
Let's start just with these then we have these out.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.670
And last but not least we have ease in and out.

02:39.780 --> 02:41.520
So that would be the last.

02:41.520 --> 02:49.200
Now all this is nice and fine and dandy but as you can see I did a little bit of extra work.

02:49.410 --> 02:56.460
So let me get rid of this guy mean get rid of this guy and let me get rid of this guy as well as you

02:56.460 --> 02:58.860
know and this is also an overkill.

02:59.040 --> 03:04.860
So for some reason I decided that I'm gonna be adding way too many examples that I would want nugget.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.980
Now that we have the H email setup.

03:06.990 --> 03:08.880
Why don't we start with CSA.

03:09.240 --> 03:12.820
And like I said the easy is gonna be default 1 but maybe.

03:12.930 --> 03:18.290
Before we start looking at the actual timing properties why don't we set up the divorce.

03:18.390 --> 03:22.390
So I'm going to say for all the divs going to be exactly the same.

03:22.480 --> 03:28.500
We're going to have the width of I don't know 100 pixels the height is also going to be hundred pixels

03:29.890 --> 03:36.240
so let's write height is gonna be hundred pixels then we also have an option of background.

03:36.550 --> 03:41.570
So let's write the background blue all of them are going to look something like this we can also add

03:41.570 --> 03:44.050
the color just so we can see the text a little bit better.

03:44.050 --> 03:45.520
So the text right now is White.

03:46.330 --> 03:46.750
You know what.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.280
We also can use a little bit of margin all around.

03:49.900 --> 03:53.250
So it's a margin it's gonna be 15 pixels.

03:53.350 --> 03:58.200
Now we're having the margin as well as let's set up some default transition.

03:58.420 --> 04:01.690
So I'm gonna say transition and all the properties are going to be affected.

04:01.910 --> 04:04.850
And this is gonna take one second of time.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.750
Now what kind of transition Mm hmm.

04:06.880 --> 04:07.750
I don't know.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.180
Let's do Dave hover.

04:09.180 --> 04:15.250
So as we're hovering the div let's combine whatever we already learned about the transform.

04:15.250 --> 04:16.580
So why don't we write transform.

04:16.690 --> 04:20.860
So we're going to be transforming and the way we're going to transform and we're going to translate

04:20.860 --> 04:23.390
it by let's say a hundred pixels.

04:23.530 --> 04:27.930
And like I said by default right away you will gonna be having disease.

04:27.940 --> 04:32.610
So if I would have right here over here is that would be the default value anyway.

04:32.740 --> 04:39.220
So technically you wouldn't have to write now if I would one for all of them linear can just type linear

04:39.550 --> 04:46.720
and then what's gonna happen is the transition is gonna have the same speed all throughout this transition.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.120
So it's gonna start in the same way and the same way.

04:49.270 --> 04:52.860
And during transition is also gonna perform the same way.

04:52.900 --> 04:58.270
Just to let you know again we have an option of testing them out like this or we can go individually

04:59.110 --> 05:04.830
and the way I would like to set up individually I'm going to delete the linear one just to show you.

05:05.500 --> 05:12.340
And here you're gonna say he's gonna be targeting the actual day of that had a class of these and here

05:12.370 --> 05:21.850
let's write the transition timing function so we can say a transition transition and timing and obviously

05:21.880 --> 05:27.700
this is going to be impossible to find and then we're gonna be looking for let's say.

05:28.060 --> 05:32.750
And again this is gonna be exactly the same how we would be writing this like this.

05:32.830 --> 05:34.060
So I could have wrote it.

05:34.120 --> 05:38.950
Transition then all then whatever two seconds any.

05:39.400 --> 05:43.750
And again this is just to show you that these are possible options.

05:43.750 --> 05:47.340
Since we have already set up the div here we transition of all.

05:47.380 --> 05:51.260
And one second I'm just adding here this timing function.

05:51.370 --> 05:56.320
But in general normally we would write something like this where we would specifically go with each

05:56.320 --> 05:57.510
and every transition.

05:57.520 --> 06:02.130
Now I don't want to do each and every transition for all of them because we have six of them.

06:02.200 --> 06:07.600
So that is the reason why I'm using the shortcut where I already set up everything in a div.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.370
So the properties all of them.

06:09.580 --> 06:16.780
The timing is gonna be one second and then for each and every div we'll is gonna look at different property

06:17.080 --> 06:19.810
value for its timing function.

06:19.810 --> 06:20.560
That's all we're doing.

06:21.070 --> 06:24.530
And as you notice there shouldn't be no difference.

06:24.550 --> 06:29.200
So the first one is gonna be exactly the same as the second because like I said the default while value

06:29.200 --> 06:30.220
is gonna be easy.

06:30.220 --> 06:33.760
So if I set up these this is going to look exactly the same.

06:33.940 --> 06:40.230
Now what our values are we're gonna have let's say we can look at linear and for the linear and we can

06:40.240 --> 06:46.440
just copy and paste this and let's just change this to linear I'd say linear.

06:46.460 --> 06:47.920
And the moment what's gonna happen.

06:47.920 --> 06:51.280
Notice that there's not gonna be this slow start or slow.

06:51.660 --> 06:58.010
This is going to take exactly the same speed as throughout the whole transition.

06:58.150 --> 07:02.920
What else we have we have used in and out and ease in and out.

07:02.920 --> 07:03.260
Okay.

07:03.280 --> 07:07.370
So first class second class and third class.

07:07.540 --> 07:11.170
So we might as well copy and paste it three times.

07:11.270 --> 07:16.960
And this is not what I wanted to do as well was not not this is what I wanted to do.

07:16.990 --> 07:25.080
So let me select the line so that I would one select action line and let's copy and paste it.

07:25.270 --> 07:25.620
You know what.

07:25.620 --> 07:27.440
Let's let's do one more time.

07:27.550 --> 07:31.530
And here we can right away delete the real winners.

07:31.710 --> 07:35.870
We're not gonna be selecting winners and yeah let's just name it.

07:35.900 --> 07:41.860
He's in and I know this might be a little bit annoying but again since I would like to show you at least

07:41.970 --> 07:46.840
a general idea behind it there's gonna be a little bit of typing and then we're going to be looking

07:46.840 --> 07:58.450
for easing in then also we have he's out he's out as well as the value here is gonna be out he's out.

07:58.600 --> 08:03.130
And last but not least we have reason not so easy in a not.

08:03.190 --> 08:08.890
And there will gonna be more options for you again if you'd like to go on research should just type

08:08.890 --> 08:09.810
in a Google.

08:09.840 --> 08:15.360
The CEO says transition timing function and you're gonna see way more options.

08:15.740 --> 08:19.520
But again in this case I don't feel like this is necessary for us.

08:19.650 --> 08:26.710
Whatever we're doing right now because we can just get away with learning the simple linear he's in

08:26.710 --> 08:27.290
her now.

08:27.390 --> 08:28.650
And ease outlets.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.580
So in the moment we save it.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.800
What's gonna happen is that with linear I'm going to repeat probably for a third time.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.070
But this is gonna be same speed ease in.

08:38.130 --> 08:42.500
It is going to have the slow start slow and it is gonna be 40 years old.

08:42.550 --> 08:48.960
And last but not least we have the ease in announced slow start and fast and slow it now as we're hovering

08:48.960 --> 08:49.540
again.

08:49.590 --> 08:52.290
The default on is gonna be exactly the same as these.

08:52.350 --> 08:56.990
Then we have the linear one going to have the same speed easing.

08:57.010 --> 09:03.750
It's just gonna have the slow start and the energy is going to perform normally ease out is gonna have

09:03.750 --> 09:10.820
the slow end and then we'll have again the slow start slow wind and the fast during their transition.

09:10.860 --> 09:15.450
Those would be the basics behind the transition timing function in the CSF.
