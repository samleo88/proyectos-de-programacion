00:00.120 --> 00:07.990
Once we have successfully added font awesome icons Well I would also like to write away set up the favor

00:08.050 --> 00:13.910
on matters that little like on that sitting side by side with my URL.

00:14.070 --> 00:17.580
And as you can see on my finished project I do have my little icon.

00:18.040 --> 00:23.020
However on the project that we're currently working well it is not displayed.

00:23.640 --> 00:29.340
Now in order to get it first and foremost we're gonna have to look for the setup files and then later

00:29.340 --> 00:33.290
on I'm gonna show you how in fact I created my particular one.

00:33.330 --> 00:38.260
So in your case if you'd like to get a different one I'll just keep on watching the video.

00:38.280 --> 00:45.360
So let's first of all head over back to the project and then within the images you're gonna notice this

00:45.360 --> 00:45.890
favor.

00:45.900 --> 00:51.550
Can I call all right now we would need to head over to a next HMO.

00:51.840 --> 01:00.520
And then let's say somewhere after these styles me close the sidebar let me write Facebook on a recon

01:00.910 --> 01:05.150
and then in this case again we're gonna have to use a link.

01:05.620 --> 01:09.970
So we're gonna write a link and visual studio called right away.

01:09.970 --> 01:12.320
Gives you this option for the favor.

01:12.630 --> 01:13.230
All right.

01:13.240 --> 01:20.500
So we do have the relationship we go with shortcut icon and then a trip is gonna have to point to our

01:20.500 --> 01:21.620
particular file.

01:21.680 --> 01:29.590
So Karen left course this file doesn't exist there and then we also have a type by the image and X icon.

01:29.590 --> 01:36.490
Now what we would need to do right now is in fact fix our path where we're looking for images and then

01:36.490 --> 01:39.520
we're looking for this favor Can I call.

01:39.580 --> 01:46.150
And then I can see clearly here all the way on the top that I successfully added My icon.

01:46.210 --> 01:48.970
So let me do it one more time.

01:49.030 --> 01:55.030
Let me generate this icon one more time just so we can maybe get your custom one for your particular

01:55.030 --> 01:56.050
project.

01:56.050 --> 02:05.170
So let me open up new browser window and let me type a vehicle on a record and it's not going to be

02:05.180 --> 02:10.570
C.C. and fact I'm going to use not the favorite on generator.

02:10.570 --> 02:18.350
I think I use this one the favorite can't iPhone let's open this in a new browser tab and then we have

02:18.350 --> 02:23.180
multiple options we can generate from damage image but I went with text.

02:23.180 --> 02:25.100
So just click on the text.

02:25.130 --> 02:26.260
Let's change this.

02:26.330 --> 02:30.440
Let's say not the F letter but I'm going to go with D.

02:31.160 --> 02:36.290
Why don't we go for different background color as well as you can see everything is customizable.

02:36.290 --> 02:42.950
So if I'm gonna go with orange of course my fave kind is going to be orange and then that's it.

02:42.950 --> 02:44.390
We just need to download it.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.730
We're gonna download the zip folder.

02:46.730 --> 02:51.740
Again let me head over back to my downloads and then within the downloads.

02:51.740 --> 02:53.530
Let's look for our favorite song.

02:53.690 --> 02:56.630
And then within the favorite one we do have the folder.

02:56.840 --> 03:01.240
And as you can see you have multiple options available.

03:01.370 --> 03:04.700
But I just went with this one with Favre can I call.

03:04.730 --> 03:08.930
So if you're just going to drag and drop this particular icon into.

03:08.930 --> 03:10.210
In fact your images.

03:10.500 --> 03:14.870
Well now in fact you're gonna be able to use the icon that you just created.

03:15.230 --> 03:20.420
So that's how we can create the favorite gone as well as this is that we can add it to our project.
