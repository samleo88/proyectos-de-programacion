00:00.680 --> 00:03.110
Now making our first web page was a lot of fun.

00:03.800 --> 00:07.130
However there are few nagging issues that I would like to fix.

00:07.150 --> 00:09.660
And first of all those would be our workspace settings.

00:10.040 --> 00:14.900
So I'm gonna head over again to the cog and then I click on the settings and now I'm going to open up

00:14.900 --> 00:19.550
these settings when I'm not within the settings and window first of all I would like to change here

00:19.820 --> 00:20.500
the font size.

00:20.810 --> 00:25.460
So again if you'd like to search for it as you can see we have an option on the search bar.

00:25.460 --> 00:30.270
And again if I'm gonna type something this is gonna bring me whatever setting I would like to change.

00:30.350 --> 00:34.160
So I'm gonna say here that this the new font size should be something like 26.

00:34.760 --> 00:38.190
So as you can see this is gonna be automatically say no next.

00:38.300 --> 00:43.830
Again just to show you that we have other option where we have the Jason object then I'm just gonna

00:43.850 --> 00:48.980
click it over here on the little icon and this is going to open up my Jason object.

00:49.070 --> 00:53.990
Now on the right hand side these are gonna be my settings or our settings that we're gonna have.

00:54.560 --> 01:00.020
And remember just by changing the zoom level notice the settings right away or here.

01:00.050 --> 01:02.450
And again we didn't do this in a previous screen.

01:02.450 --> 01:06.620
Remember we did it previously when we were zooming in and zooming out.

01:06.920 --> 01:10.210
So for now your zoom level let's say is at 2.

01:10.350 --> 01:12.560
Now if I'm gonna press it one more time.

01:12.560 --> 01:16.720
Notice is gonna zoom in now my zoom level is gonna be a three.

01:16.760 --> 01:21.650
Now within this screen the way we'll work again is gonna be the similar way because again we can look

01:21.650 --> 01:22.670
for something.

01:22.700 --> 01:25.250
Now what I'm looking for is the tab size.

01:25.490 --> 01:27.130
I can just say tab size.

01:27.320 --> 01:31.070
And this is gonna bring me to the editor and TAB size.

01:31.100 --> 01:36.180
Now we're not going to be able to do any kind of work here because was gonna complain that this is going

01:36.180 --> 01:37.400
to be read only.

01:37.400 --> 01:40.910
So if I'm going to try to change this something here this is not gonna work.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.950
However we're all going to have an option of editing.

01:44.030 --> 01:48.390
So if I'm gonna click on this little pencil it says right away copy to the settings.

01:48.770 --> 01:53.510
So the moment I'm gonna do that this is gonna copy into the settings where I can change that.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.310
So in my case I would have them.

01:55.370 --> 02:02.180
I would like to have them as one now again depending on how you like to work your zoom level is always

02:02.190 --> 02:04.140
welcome change for me.

02:04.160 --> 02:09.250
I'm gonna leave this for now at you and later on I'm gonna see how this is gonna work.

02:09.260 --> 02:13.420
So what we can do right now is just close both settings and we are ready to go.
