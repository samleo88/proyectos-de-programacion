WEBVTT

00:00.760 --> 00:05.780
And the last section of going to be creating is going to be this simple footer section right.

00:05.790 --> 00:11.370
So go to our page here now or here all the way in the bottom.

00:11.540 --> 00:18.150
To this is going to be we're here to say this is going to be a father right or he'll going to write

00:18.150 --> 00:19.360
our rules right.

00:19.520 --> 00:24.710
So when he's going to say this is going to be for his we don't need to have any kind of there anymore

00:24.710 --> 00:26.620
or ideas or anything like that.

00:26.750 --> 00:32.480
He's going to say over here this is going to be for text and not like this.

00:32.500 --> 00:39.810
And within a foot or text we're going to have a heading three with or here a copyright copyright and

00:39.860 --> 00:44.420
we're going to have a copy of this copy.

00:46.050 --> 00:51.220
Not song or Kong copy here.

00:51.290 --> 00:59.320
And then we're going to have a 2017 then we're going to have a dot or you're going to write All rights

01:00.430 --> 01:07.480
reserved and then we're going to have DAB over here and then we're going to have another day with a

01:07.480 --> 01:08.470
full icons site.

01:08.480 --> 01:17.350
So for text this is going to be for icons here and with all that right over here this is going to be

01:17.380 --> 01:18.420
a link.

01:18.600 --> 01:23.410
And this is going to also going to have a Atra like this is going to be hash tag here we're going to

01:23.410 --> 01:30.820
say this is going to be I far far off Facebook on Facebook.

01:30.900 --> 01:33.630
We're here doing this and they're all going to press.

01:33.910 --> 01:36.950
And then we're going to copy this three times.

01:36.970 --> 01:38.980
Right so we're going to select one two three.

01:39.340 --> 01:44.910
And this is going to be Google Plus Google Plus.

01:44.920 --> 01:49.660
And this is going to be Instagram Instagram.

01:49.900 --> 01:51.850
And then this is going to be Twitter.

01:52.130 --> 01:54.010
It's all going back over here.

01:54.370 --> 01:55.130
Twitter.

01:55.130 --> 01:55.730
All right.

01:55.800 --> 02:00.210
So now that we have this we are going to go to Maine see assess and starts dialing.

02:00.210 --> 02:02.990
All right here for the footer.

02:03.010 --> 02:09.700
We're going to have one two three five rolls all right all the way I'm going on here in the bottom you

02:09.850 --> 02:11.670
just create more space.

02:11.700 --> 02:12.120
Can you say.

02:12.120 --> 02:18.480
This is going to be for footer over here and we're going to say this is going to be forever and then

02:18.490 --> 02:26.920
we're going to have a background color and the back on is going to be hash tag 1 9 and 1 7 1 6 1 7 1

02:26.920 --> 02:32.810
6 and what are going to have padding is going to be 20 pixels.

02:33.100 --> 02:33.760
All right.

02:33.970 --> 02:37.290
And then we're going to have this play and flex.

02:37.290 --> 02:37.780
All right.

02:38.080 --> 02:42.640
And then we're going to have a flex rap rap here rap.

02:42.640 --> 02:51.820
I going to say Rob we're going to have a justified content space between this and then we're going to

02:51.820 --> 02:54.290
have a line item space line.

02:54.370 --> 02:54.940
Right.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.270
So line items.

02:56.290 --> 02:57.400
Baseline right.

02:57.650 --> 03:02.130
Obviously we cannot see anything right now because this is a really small screen.

03:02.380 --> 03:02.960
Right.

03:03.040 --> 03:06.560
But as we go to the bigger one you can see that everything is working all right.

03:06.580 --> 03:10.820
So we're going to we're going to have to create some more space then we're going to have a fuller text.

03:10.850 --> 03:20.260
Right so we're here going to say for when you say text and this is going to be text transform text transform

03:20.980 --> 03:25.690
and or here we're going to say this is going to be uppercase and we're here we're going to write this

03:25.690 --> 03:34.000
is going to be font size and this is going to be 15 pixels then we're going to have a color and the

03:34.000 --> 03:44.590
color is actually going to be the zero g and to d be right on here then we have a margin bottom margin

03:45.470 --> 03:48.730
lower than pixels.

03:49.010 --> 03:59.050
Then once we have this we're going to go to the footer icons for icons on here like this and we're going

03:59.050 --> 04:04.940
to say font size and this is going to be 30 pixels right 30 pixels.

04:05.170 --> 04:05.720
Right.

04:05.900 --> 04:12.490
And we're going to have fewer icons if they are for icons.

04:12.840 --> 04:17.610
Hey And we're going to say this is going to be margin right.

04:17.620 --> 04:20.130
And this is going to be 10 pixels.

04:20.480 --> 04:26.140
Then we're going to have a color and the colors are going to great e zero e.

04:26.290 --> 04:26.700
Right.

04:26.710 --> 04:32.560
And then we're going to have to d do the B and then over here we're going to say transition is going

04:32.560 --> 04:34.450
to be transform transition.

04:34.830 --> 04:36.800
Transform right.

04:36.850 --> 04:43.050
Once we have that we're going to say two seconds and then we're going to have a actual hover effect

04:43.060 --> 04:43.900
right.

04:43.960 --> 04:53.080
So let's grab this guy or grab this guy up here this one and copy and paste and we're going to say over

04:54.910 --> 04:56.460
here and what we're going to say.

04:56.450 --> 05:01.530
And this is going to be color and the collagen can be hash tag it's going to be 0.

05:01.570 --> 05:04.000
I'm sorry 6.

05:04.220 --> 05:07.940
He is going to be to e.

05:08.010 --> 05:09.550
He really like this.

05:09.660 --> 05:15.190
And then we're going to say transform and we should be pretty familiar with this translate we're going

05:15.250 --> 05:22.330
to say that this is going to be translated why negative 15 pixels like this.

05:22.330 --> 05:25.990
And once we say this we can go back over here to the web agency.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.210
All right refresher here.

05:28.640 --> 05:30.130
Refresh one more time.

05:30.220 --> 05:32.340
And now we can have our footer right.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.850
And Aurukun we're here you can see that something went wrong with the colors.

05:35.860 --> 05:36.540
Right.

05:36.610 --> 05:39.520
So if we go back over here we would just need to check it out.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.950
Where where was the mistake right.

05:41.980 --> 05:44.730
Because we have four foot icons we have over here.

05:45.200 --> 05:49.870
But it's not actually changing color or here this is a caption side right.

05:49.880 --> 05:53.700
So obviously we want a color to color.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.210
Now we're saying this now it should work.

05:56.210 --> 05:56.780
Right.

05:56.780 --> 06:03.240
So you go back over here you can see that the icon is actually going to be going up and then going down.

06:03.410 --> 06:05.060
And this is going to be it for this project.

06:05.060 --> 06:09.850
Guys I hope you guys enjoyed it and I hope you guys are going to join me for my next project.
