00:00.420 --> 00:06.900
Now before we proceed with the rest of the tutorial you know what I would like to take a detour and

00:06.900 --> 00:12.210
in fact change some color values because I believe we're going to be able to see a little bit better

00:12.540 --> 00:14.790
as we're working with our syntax.

00:14.790 --> 00:21.360
So I apologize but we're gonna have to head over back to style see assess and add some hex colors to

00:21.360 --> 00:22.440
our cells.

00:22.440 --> 00:27.040
Now what I'm going to do right now is in fact create multiple selectors.

00:27.250 --> 00:29.810
So we're gonna say something like that.

00:29.850 --> 00:32.380
Now I'm only going to add colors to our five selves.

00:32.700 --> 00:40.920
So let's type your cell and then we're going to go in fact with one then two and you get the gist three

00:41.900 --> 00:44.560
four and five.

00:44.930 --> 00:50.900
So these ones will be generic and I'm just gonna leave them at the end because I might add some cells

00:50.900 --> 00:56.240
and might remove them but I would want some basic wants to have some kind of colouring because I believe

00:56.240 --> 00:59.580
it's going to be easier for us to work with them right now.

00:59.700 --> 01:04.880
So let's roll back to style C assess like I said and maybe let's increase the border.

01:04.880 --> 01:09.440
So I'm going to go with let's say three pixels just so we can see more clear.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.350
Where are our items now.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.540
That's number one.

01:12.620 --> 01:16.510
And then also I'm gonna go with color of white.

01:16.640 --> 01:25.160
So f f f and like I said let's add some coloring so let's say Cell Number one he is going to have a

01:25.160 --> 01:29.920
background and I'm gonna go with the same color that we used for Flex box sartorial.

01:30.290 --> 01:35.620
So let's go with 5 8 1 F 1 8.

01:35.780 --> 01:41.040
So and then what I'm going to do right now is in fact copy and paste it.

01:41.150 --> 01:42.450
I need five of them.

01:42.500 --> 01:47.260
So now I do have them and let's just change first through all these selectors.

01:47.300 --> 01:54.710
So three four and five and now we're going to change the actual colors as well.

01:54.710 --> 02:02.120
So let's go with f 0 a 2 0 2 0 2.

02:02.450 --> 02:05.870
Well that is going to be my yellow 1 and 9.

02:05.870 --> 02:07.850
Let's also change this one to orange.

02:08.450 --> 02:19.160
So the 9 5 D 3 9 D 3 9 something like that that is going to be my orange one.

02:19.280 --> 02:27.560
Then we have one more let's say blue one or two see 5 9.

02:27.710 --> 02:29.540
Well that is going to be my blue one.

02:29.790 --> 02:33.450
And then let's say the fifth is going to be green.

02:33.630 --> 02:40.760
So hashtag f or M's are not f just 5 1 CB and 2 0.

02:40.960 --> 02:45.930
Now again I apologize I probably should have done this when we were doing the setup but as I started

02:45.930 --> 02:51.750
working with my cells I just noticed that I think this is going to help us a little bit more where we

02:51.750 --> 02:56.900
have different coloring for ourselves so that way we can see more clearer.

02:57.030 --> 03:00.000
Well how our grid is in fact performing.

03:00.040 --> 03:00.310
All right.

03:00.630 --> 03:04.610
So once we have added the colors now we're ready to move on to our next topic.
