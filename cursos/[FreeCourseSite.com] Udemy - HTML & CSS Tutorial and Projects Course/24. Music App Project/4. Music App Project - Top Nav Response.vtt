WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:04.700
And the next section are going to be building is going to be on this top notch.

00:04.900 --> 00:09.360
And so you can see on the bigger screen this is all that's going on this right.

00:09.360 --> 00:16.730
We're going to have this button that's actually going to make sure that our side of actually disappears.

00:16.740 --> 00:17.400
Right.

00:17.430 --> 00:19.320
However if I got on the small screen right.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.750
This is how it's going to look over here.

00:20.780 --> 00:21.180
Right.

00:21.360 --> 00:25.170
So this is all this what we're going to achieve with the flex box.

00:25.220 --> 00:26.440
And this is going to be delayed.

00:26.510 --> 00:27.010
Right.

00:27.030 --> 00:29.060
So for now it's created over here.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.820
And let's give it a style.

00:30.870 --> 00:38.070
So here what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back to my next session in a row and once my novel is

00:38.070 --> 00:39.440
finished.

00:39.670 --> 00:41.410
Right now outside.

00:41.790 --> 00:44.480
Now what I'm going to create is going to be made.

00:44.980 --> 00:48.030
So this is going to be my main section right.

00:48.110 --> 00:52.900
And within the main section the first thing that I'm going to create is going to be another knife.

00:53.070 --> 00:56.120
However this is going to be a naff top.

00:56.350 --> 01:00.400
So this is going to be the novel with a class of Naphtali.

01:00.780 --> 01:05.840
And once we have it here the first thing that I'm going to say is this is going to be Divx with now

01:05.850 --> 01:07.140
of VTM.

01:07.370 --> 01:11.950
So now Martin I know here will actually do the same thing right.

01:11.970 --> 01:16.430
We're going to use the same bars because we don't need to do this twice.

01:16.430 --> 01:20.850
If we can actually skip this right so we're going to copy paste this and we're going to we're going

01:20.850 --> 01:21.770
to have the same thing.

01:21.770 --> 01:22.680
All right.

01:22.950 --> 01:27.360
Then after that we have created one here now.

01:27.850 --> 01:29.050
And now button.

01:29.240 --> 01:29.840
Right.

01:29.970 --> 01:33.740
What we would want to do is create these two chevrons.

01:33.810 --> 01:39.060
So what I'm going to say we're moving along right now button is done.

01:39.180 --> 01:44.310
But over here we're going to write that this is going to be a div right and that there is going to be

01:44.310 --> 01:51.170
Chevron ikons Chevron should run icons on your price tab.

01:51.370 --> 01:57.750
And now we're going to place a again a link and within the link We're going to play sexually as planned

01:58.090 --> 02:00.340
and then we're going to have a chevron ikons.

02:00.430 --> 02:04.470
So I'm going to start over here with the wink and this is going to be a link.

02:04.570 --> 02:10.750
I know we're going to say this is going to be a pattern here and within the span we're going to have

02:10.750 --> 02:12.000
actually I.

02:12.330 --> 02:13.100
Hey.

02:14.030 --> 02:14.640
Hey.

02:14.710 --> 02:22.160
And this is going to be chevron on the left or right price tab on here.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.180
I can see that we have our icon right.

02:24.330 --> 02:30.340
So what I'm going to select or reduce link copy and paste this I know he'll get to read Chevron right

02:31.670 --> 02:34.410
here like this Chevron right.

02:34.490 --> 02:34.780
Right.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.730
So now you can see we have two of them all right.

02:37.930 --> 02:40.790
Then once we are done with the Chevron icons.

02:40.870 --> 02:41.280
Right.

02:41.390 --> 02:48.000
And if this was the button this is going to be Chevron guns then we actually have a form.

02:48.110 --> 02:51.790
So I'm going to write for him more here who have no auction.

02:52.160 --> 02:58.090
And so the form is going to be it's going to have no post or get action here we're going to write in

02:58.080 --> 03:03.690
put and or here we're going to site type search in this place holder.

03:03.740 --> 03:06.220
We're going to say this is going to be search here.

03:06.600 --> 03:13.220
So going right over here this is going to be search and we're going to right here now once we're done

03:13.220 --> 03:14.640
with this placeholder.

03:14.690 --> 03:15.320
Right.

03:15.440 --> 03:15.910
Right.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.230
Maybe in 90.

03:17.480 --> 03:22.740
So let's say here that this is going to be I.D. and the idea is going to be search.

03:22.840 --> 03:23.390
So right.

03:23.390 --> 03:26.150
Or your search now.

03:26.460 --> 03:31.200
Once we're done with this and put the next one that we would want a link.

03:31.260 --> 03:37.750
So going around on link and this is going to be hash tag link.

03:37.860 --> 03:40.570
So basically it's going to be a dummy link then.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.850
Here again we're going to have a plan.

03:43.210 --> 03:47.620
And within the span we're going to actually have a high F and s.

03:47.790 --> 03:52.620
And again this is going to be FAA search phase search like this.

03:52.620 --> 03:52.890
Right.

03:52.890 --> 04:00.900
First time now you can see we have input and we have are just like line after the form right after we'd

04:00.900 --> 04:05.590
done with one moving along what we would want is actually an image.

04:05.670 --> 04:09.110
So I'm going to say I m g on this.

04:09.240 --> 04:14.520
And within a day we're going to have image and the source for the image is going to be high energy and

04:14.570 --> 04:17.510
I.D. And so this is going to be.

04:17.790 --> 04:23.040
Then after that we're going to find this is going to be image and this animal just go right over here.

04:23.040 --> 04:26.820
This is going to be his name and the name is going to be John Doe.

04:26.890 --> 04:28.610
So going right here.

04:28.750 --> 04:29.500
Three.

04:29.670 --> 04:35.590
And this is going to be John let's say John Doe John Doe.

04:35.910 --> 04:42.390
And then once we close the they will rewrite what we would want is actually the last thing is going

04:42.390 --> 04:43.940
to be signed out.

04:44.210 --> 04:47.480
So we're going to we're going to create a dummy link hash tag over here.

04:47.730 --> 04:55.230
And this is going to have a class that's going to say a class and the class is going to be signed out

04:55.710 --> 05:01.490
and over here again we're going to create a Ispahan span or here within the span we're going to have

05:01.550 --> 05:02.540
a sign out.

05:02.540 --> 05:12.710
So I'm going to say Fay as if he were here sign out and we're going to see alternative press over here.

05:12.950 --> 05:21.650
And then once we have it over here once the span is done right with him then or here will say look out.

05:22.460 --> 05:28.720
And then press tab and now we're ready to go ahead and actually start styling this.

05:28.740 --> 05:29.730
All right.

05:29.870 --> 05:37.110
So we can say this and we're going into here we're going to say this is going to be the main thing and

05:37.140 --> 05:42.620
the main says let's create some comments here.

05:42.710 --> 05:50.810
Top have again some more hashtags over here and we're going to say we're here is going to create way

05:50.810 --> 05:52.590
more space here.

05:52.740 --> 05:59.900
So can a writer like this and then we're going to say now I have to hope this and the way you would

05:59.900 --> 06:02.020
want to have top to be right.

06:02.030 --> 06:05.280
We would want it to be 107 pixels.

06:05.330 --> 06:06.050
Right.

06:06.110 --> 06:08.910
Now let me show you where I'm getting this hundreds and pixels.

06:08.920 --> 06:09.570
All right.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.460
We're going to go back over here.

06:11.470 --> 06:12.420
All right.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.650
You can see that.

06:13.730 --> 06:15.170
You see is more in line.

06:15.170 --> 06:21.080
All right with that we haven't created yet but I want it to match exactly how it is over here.

06:21.080 --> 06:21.620
Right.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.480
So they should be equal.

06:23.480 --> 06:23.690
Right.

06:23.690 --> 06:29.180
So I didn't want it lower I didn't want high I wanted them too much or hear it like this perfectly.

06:29.210 --> 06:34.950
Now since we have our main CSSA right you see or hear does box sizing border box right.

06:35.210 --> 06:39.800
So what it means is as I add the border the border is not going to be lower.

06:39.830 --> 06:40.200
Right.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.830
In fact the actual element this is going to get smaller.

06:42.830 --> 06:43.350
Right.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.940
But the but if I'm saying 1 7.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.950
So the actual element is going to be one and so on.

06:48.980 --> 06:50.580
And the border is going to move up.

06:50.660 --> 06:56.930
Now where I'm getting one of seven we're going to go here and if we press let's say inspect and if we're

06:56.930 --> 06:58.590
going to go here right.

06:58.760 --> 07:03.550
You see that on my side and right on my logo container right.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.170
It's kind of hard to see right.

07:05.450 --> 07:13.590
But if I'm actually scrolling over I actually said that the logo containers actually 1 0 7.

07:13.690 --> 07:17.500
And so that's where I'm getting the 107 pixels right.

07:17.750 --> 07:22.750
And maybe if I tried to zoom in right or you know what it's not working anyway.

07:22.970 --> 07:29.330
So basically it is one on someone because I looked at what our dimensions are here for this container.

07:29.440 --> 07:29.640
Right.

07:29.650 --> 07:35.260
So let me close this one maybe to zoom out more or you know what let's find 100 is fine.

07:35.390 --> 07:40.760
So I'm going to go back over here and we're going to have in the top and we're going to say that this

07:40.760 --> 07:45.430
is going to be height of one on seven pixels.

07:45.950 --> 07:49.880
Then we're going to say this play is going to read the way say this black box right.

07:50.010 --> 07:52.110
So now I can see that we have one big line.

07:52.110 --> 07:57.570
All right then we're going to say flex and we're going to say flex wrap.

07:57.590 --> 08:01.690
So basically as the screen gets more this should be wrapping.

08:01.850 --> 08:03.760
They should be getting to the new line.

08:04.340 --> 08:09.040
Then we're here we're going to say justify or here content.

08:09.380 --> 08:12.270
Going to say space around this.

08:12.450 --> 08:12.940
Right.

08:13.100 --> 08:14.920
And then we'll say this border.

08:14.980 --> 08:15.460
Right.

08:15.470 --> 08:21.700
The one that I was telling you about more bottom and we're going to have five pixels solid and I'm going

08:21.700 --> 08:23.570
to will use this orange color.

08:23.600 --> 08:35.220
So I have 1 5 0 2 5 this right then next one would want to say all here now I've between reading this

08:35.730 --> 08:44.690
and I would want to say more more here we're here and we would want three pixels three pixels solid

08:45.100 --> 08:48.920
and we're going to say hash tag 2 7 2 7 2 7.

08:49.090 --> 08:51.600
Right now we created it over here just now.

08:51.890 --> 08:55.000
Now what I would want to do is have a cursor.

08:55.060 --> 08:56.580
We're going to say pointer.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.630
And so as I'm hovering in there's going to be pointer.

08:59.710 --> 09:03.540
However I would want to have in display none on the small screen.

09:03.550 --> 09:03.950
Right.

09:04.190 --> 09:10.010
Only as a as you can see only as I'm getting to the big screen right to have the button on a small and

09:10.010 --> 09:12.150
I don't I make this more bigger.

09:12.150 --> 09:13.340
Now I have it right.

09:13.400 --> 09:18.250
So by default there right away I wanted to have this play and going to say none right.

09:18.440 --> 09:23.930
So obviously once we're going to be working with our responsiveness with the media queries right then

09:23.930 --> 09:28.560
we're going to actually set to display block right there once we were done with this.

09:28.570 --> 09:37.860
What we would want is Chevron ikons icons we're here and we're going to say and what we would want is

09:37.860 --> 09:47.600
font size and we're going to say 30 pixels here and will have a margin 10 pixels all around like this.

09:47.730 --> 09:51.070
Then the next one we're going to say the knife image.

09:51.200 --> 09:55.570
I think I would want to have a picture and the text side by side.

09:55.860 --> 10:01.950
So I'm going to say Now have I am g when I hear this play I'm going to say flux right now I can see

10:01.950 --> 10:03.830
that they're both side by side.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.870
Now let's actually start working with the actual image.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.110
We're going to say we're here like this.

10:08.110 --> 10:08.870
Now I have.

10:09.250 --> 10:16.080
And to top it now top this was the class for an hour and now I'm working with an image and I'm going

10:16.080 --> 10:26.330
to say with 35 pixels like this that I'm going to have a height of 35 pixels more here then we're going

10:26.330 --> 10:33.010
to say a border we're going to say radios and arrays is going to be 50 percent.

10:33.150 --> 10:37.020
Right so this is going to be around margin right.

10:37.070 --> 10:43.910
We're going to say that this is going to be 10 pixels like this and a line cell phone going to say Center.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.860
All right so I'm going to say on line.

10:45.890 --> 10:50.840
So if you're going to say Center on this right now.

10:51.200 --> 10:57.560
Once we're done with this let's go ahead and let's work over here with this heading three.

10:57.710 --> 11:05.980
So what I'm going to say here is that we would want a head of I Am G and we're going to say adding three

11:06.530 --> 11:14.480
and this whole line self We're going to we're going to say they're doing this and then we'll have a

11:14.480 --> 11:15.230
caller.

11:15.530 --> 11:17.770
And this is going to be a hash tag.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.640
And the hash tag is going to be to 6:53.

11:20.750 --> 11:32.810
So it to 6:53 this and then we'll have a font size of 25 font size 25 pixels on it like this.

11:32.830 --> 11:41.480
Now once we're actually done with this now the next one would want to work with a input right.

11:41.560 --> 11:50.240
So let's go back over here and let's add a now top and we're going to send that up a.

11:50.670 --> 11:50.970
Right.

11:51.070 --> 11:58.240
So after we have worked with an image and having three we're going to say we now have top down.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.610
We're going to say we're here.

12:00.130 --> 12:07.610
And we're going to say color and the color is going to be hash tag 1 5 0 2 5 right.

12:07.630 --> 12:10.780
So all the links over here are going to be like this.

12:10.780 --> 12:11.520
Right.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.610
Then after that would we would want is a nav input.

12:15.610 --> 12:24.300
So we're going to say now have top up and we're going to say in part on this we're going to say font

12:25.230 --> 12:32.490
size and we're going to say 16 pixels like this then we're going to have a border and the border is

12:32.490 --> 12:44.400
going to be two pixels solid solid and I'm going to say hash tag a one a two and a one on this one.

12:44.450 --> 12:50.380
So this is going to be more and then will have a padding of five pixels like this.

12:50.750 --> 12:56.600
Now once we are done with this or here what I would want to do is actually work with a placeholder.

12:56.790 --> 12:59.210
And so with this text inside or here right.

12:59.390 --> 13:09.170
What I'm going to say or here is I'm going to say that this is going to be here to help an input placeholder.

13:09.530 --> 13:17.310
And this is going to be actually color and the color is going to be hash tag one a to one red.

13:17.360 --> 13:21.500
So this is going to be called The last thing I would want for the sign out.

13:21.500 --> 13:21.840
All right.

13:21.890 --> 13:29.680
I would want to have a text so I'm going to say sign out and we're all going to say we're here and this

13:29.680 --> 13:35.410
is going to be font size let's say 25 pixels right.

13:35.470 --> 13:40.220
Now before we add responsiveness there's actually a few things that I would need to fix or here.

13:40.240 --> 13:40.960
Right.

13:41.350 --> 13:47.050
And the first one is that actually I forgot or here to add a line item center.

13:47.290 --> 13:50.590
It's on the same line items center.

13:50.610 --> 13:56.220
And this then more here we're going to say space around not in between.

13:56.220 --> 13:58.300
All right so this is going to look like this.

13:58.390 --> 14:03.650
Then the next thing that we're going to say is we're here this log out you see it and I wrote it as

14:03.650 --> 14:05.080
it tags.

14:05.180 --> 14:11.800
And what we would want to hear words is going right and this is going to be a log out here and then

14:11.910 --> 14:13.420
let's go back over here.

14:13.960 --> 14:17.770
And if we have a sign out then we're going to write that sign.

14:17.790 --> 14:22.350
I don't know we're here let's say that we will be targeting our text.

14:22.390 --> 14:22.860
Right.

14:22.950 --> 14:26.380
So we're going to say this is going to be text decoration.

14:26.470 --> 14:26.950
All right.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.080
We're going to say none.

14:28.300 --> 14:36.350
And then we're going to say a text transform text transform and we're going to say all here uppercase.

14:36.360 --> 14:36.980
All right.

14:37.030 --> 14:40.950
So here now we have a this big log out here.

14:40.980 --> 14:41.600
Right.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.940
And if we really want right we can have the whole sign out.

14:46.110 --> 14:48.980
Let's say that you are going to have a panning right.

14:49.040 --> 14:54.220
I'm going to say parding left and you know what lots of padding right padding right.

14:54.280 --> 14:58.190
And we're going to let's say like 20 pixels like this right.

14:58.420 --> 15:07.170
And you know what let's just do 10 pixels or 20 pixels all around right and 20 pixels might be zero

15:07.450 --> 15:10.300
bottom and or here 20 like this right.

15:10.450 --> 15:14.810
So as I'm going to use right we have a little bit of padding.

15:14.810 --> 15:19.370
All right but if I go to the bigger one right you can see that everything is going to be work.

15:19.700 --> 15:27.310
Now once we're done with this now we need to care about is how they're going to be displayed regarding

15:27.310 --> 15:28.280
the body.

15:28.500 --> 15:28.970
Right.

15:29.080 --> 15:34.780
So here if we're looking at our body when you're doing this once we go back to the next page The now

15:35.250 --> 15:38.190
I think we need to understand a few things right.

15:38.380 --> 15:44.230
So if we're looking at the actual body right how many children does it has so far.

15:44.230 --> 15:45.020
Right.

15:45.070 --> 15:49.700
It has a Nav. here and it is going to have a main.

15:49.760 --> 15:50.100
Right.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.210
So these are the two children that they have.

15:52.510 --> 15:55.630
So now what we want to focus on is how this is going to be displayed.

15:55.630 --> 15:56.160
Right.

15:56.170 --> 16:01.780
Because we know that once there is going to be small screen it's going to be displayed one way and then

16:01.780 --> 16:07.130
once we move to the bigger screen and you can see how everything is changing right at the top now becomes

16:07.130 --> 16:08.390
the side now.

16:08.530 --> 16:09.790
So how do we do that.

16:10.120 --> 16:17.210
So we're going to go back over here and I'm going to say with a major assess what we would want is we're

16:17.260 --> 16:18.570
going to create some rules.

16:18.570 --> 16:19.440
All right.

16:19.690 --> 16:21.680
So first of all going to say we're here like this.

16:21.730 --> 16:28.050
Right we're going to write and this is going to be responsive responsive or here then we're going to

16:28.060 --> 16:29.530
write for the whole body.

16:29.570 --> 16:30.210
Right.

16:30.250 --> 16:34.350
We would always want a min height to be 100.

16:34.470 --> 16:41.490
You heartsore I think always the body should be minimum hundred units right all the time.

16:41.500 --> 16:47.360
As we're watching this all we should take this whole space and then we're going to save this plan we're

16:47.350 --> 16:48.570
going to say flex.

16:48.710 --> 16:49.120
Right.

16:49.330 --> 16:52.030
But now you see that we have flex road direction.

16:52.090 --> 16:53.180
That's not what we want.

16:53.210 --> 16:53.600
Right.

16:53.740 --> 16:58.160
Well we would want is flex direction are going to say call them.

16:58.250 --> 17:03.130
So now it's back to how it was right then or here would do us.

17:03.290 --> 17:09.610
We're going to say for the main event which was the second child right there was one nap and then was

17:09.730 --> 17:10.590
another main.

17:10.640 --> 17:11.250
Right.

17:11.350 --> 17:17.610
We're all going to say here that let's say just so we can see we're going to say his background red.

17:17.750 --> 17:20.000
So we can see if this is going to be the name.

17:20.020 --> 17:24.700
Now what we're going to do here is we're going to say for the main since it is a child we're going to

17:24.700 --> 17:26.000
say flex one.

17:26.140 --> 17:26.520
Right.

17:26.580 --> 17:31.740
So now I can see that it grows much as it can to actually hundred view.

17:31.750 --> 17:32.610
Right.

17:32.770 --> 17:35.460
Shrink do not shrink and auto or hair.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.810
Right now it can get rid of this red.

17:37.970 --> 17:40.840
And because we already have the background for the whole thing.

17:40.840 --> 17:41.290
Right.

17:41.320 --> 17:45.720
I just wanted to see and I just wanted to show you how it actually works.

17:45.740 --> 17:46.320
All right.

17:46.600 --> 17:53.470
And you know what maybe the last thing here with this text maybe let's add a text transform to capitalize.

17:53.500 --> 17:59.550
So we're going to go back again to Mansi assess we're going to look at where it's heading three and

17:59.560 --> 18:02.280
we're all just going all right and this is going to be text.

18:02.460 --> 18:04.150
We're going to say transform.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.310
We're going to capitalize on it here right.

18:06.310 --> 18:13.680
So now let's go ahead and let's create the rules of when we're actually changing the screen size right.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.730
So let's add this kind of effect.

18:15.730 --> 18:16.230
Right.

18:16.290 --> 18:19.360
And as we go to the bigger screen everything changes or here.
