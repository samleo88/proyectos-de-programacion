WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:00.690
All right.

00:00.720 --> 00:06.230
Up next we have e m values which again in one sentence would be relative value.

00:06.300 --> 00:09.410
However the key is in the details.

00:09.450 --> 00:16.110
So basically devil is in the details where it depends on a parent again and as always I think it's just

00:16.110 --> 00:19.110
easier to go through with an example.

00:19.140 --> 00:24.030
Now we're gonna head over first to indexation AML and we're going to create something else.

00:24.150 --> 00:27.490
I'm gonna say there's gonna be paragraph and four paragraph.

00:27.510 --> 00:29.640
I don't know can be you know what.

00:29.640 --> 00:34.770
Let's just write text absolute and actually change my mind so I'm can read Paragraph.

00:34.770 --> 00:41.050
We're gonna be hearing three with a text off first maybe relative as well as we're going to have the

00:41.050 --> 00:45.730
same class so there was a class and this is also gonna be relative.

00:45.730 --> 00:50.800
Now what I would like to do with the second heading one since I'm going to copy and paste it is I'm

00:50.800 --> 00:57.410
gonna change this value from the relative and I'm gonna say this will gonna be absolute.

00:58.060 --> 00:59.520
So two hitting threes.

00:59.710 --> 01:01.940
One with relative and the other one with absolute.

01:02.200 --> 01:08.650
So far so good then we're heading back to style C assess and we can obviously get rid of these styles

01:08.680 --> 01:14.390
because we already don't have the diff so there's no use for them whenever I'm gonna be working right

01:14.420 --> 01:20.520
now with the relative and absolute I would like to select the class because this is what I have in my

01:20.520 --> 01:21.830
indexation you know.

01:21.980 --> 01:23.830
So first let me try to select.

01:24.460 --> 01:29.930
So I'm going to say for relative value I'm gonna add something that's not going to make sense right

01:29.930 --> 01:34.040
now I'm gonna say let's say font size the property we already know.

01:34.040 --> 01:37.640
So this should make sense but I'm gonna write to Ms.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.060
Okay.

01:38.540 --> 01:40.000
So I'm getting the text.

01:40.220 --> 01:46.750
I mean doesn't really matter what I have there because I haven't covered yet what is in MS but now let's

01:46.750 --> 01:47.710
look at the absolute.

01:47.890 --> 01:54.200
So I'm going to say absolute absolute and this is gonna be font size and obviously this would be second

01:54.220 --> 01:58.750
hand and three and we're gonna say font size is gonna be 32 pixels.

01:59.340 --> 02:00.200
Okay.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.910
Now I know it might be hard to see because it's a different text.

02:03.910 --> 02:08.680
So maybe if you want you can go back and just write in different text the one that would match absolute

02:08.720 --> 02:13.890
but I can tell you right away they are exactly the same now how do I know.

02:14.690 --> 02:19.670
Well you see first of all as I'm looking here what do you think is a parent element for my relative

02:19.670 --> 02:21.170
class here.

02:21.170 --> 02:28.240
Well if I'm looking at it I see that this is a body and for the body by default in most cases the base

02:28.240 --> 02:34.510
text or default browser styles which will by the way cover the default browser styles right after this

02:34.510 --> 02:38.880
section and the default browser style is 16 pixels.

02:39.010 --> 02:47.050
Basically the font size or default browsers I'm sorry in the browser default font size is 16 pixels

02:47.920 --> 02:57.470
now 1 a.m. 1 E M value is equal to in this case 16 pixels however if we're going to change this value

02:57.950 --> 03:00.360
then also the E M is going to change.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.360
So for now both of them are exactly the same.

03:02.960 --> 03:06.140
Because this is 32 pixels absolute value.

03:06.140 --> 03:14.570
And this to them is also 32 pixels because my default browser style is 16 pixel.

03:14.570 --> 03:18.740
But what about if we're going to go to the settings and again you don't have to do this you can just

03:18.740 --> 03:19.840
watch how I'm doing it.

03:20.240 --> 03:24.160
But as I click on the second order here I have an option for the settings.

03:24.170 --> 03:28.580
Now I'm going to click on the settings and then as you scroll down noticed you have an option for font

03:28.580 --> 03:29.240
size.

03:29.240 --> 03:33.900
Now again if you're using different browser it would be look a different place but if you are using

03:33.900 --> 03:37.630
Google Chrome you should be able to find here font size.

03:37.670 --> 03:41.500
Now in this case I have right away medium which is default style.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.550
Well what if I would change this.

03:43.550 --> 03:45.770
What I would say over here very large.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.360
I can close the settings.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.140
Notice something interesting.

03:49.160 --> 03:57.680
So now my relative is actually way bigger than the absolute because I changed this default browser style

03:57.680 --> 03:58.660
font size.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.830
Now this is not anymore 16.

04:00.860 --> 04:01.940
This is in fact bigger.

04:01.940 --> 04:07.130
And I can see this because this relative is actually bigger than absolute.

04:07.130 --> 04:13.140
Now let me first of all change it back and once I change it back let's create another example.

04:13.210 --> 04:16.600
And just so you know for sure that this is exactly what I'm saying.

04:16.820 --> 04:19.480
Now I'm gonna head over again back to indexation email.

04:19.740 --> 04:24.470
And in this case we're going to create our own parent containers for these heading three so for the

04:24.470 --> 04:30.000
first one we're gonna create some random div and Megan selected probably going to place it here within

04:30.000 --> 04:30.410
the day.

04:30.740 --> 04:33.640
And for the second one we're also going to do the same thing.

04:33.710 --> 04:35.650
So almost everything the same.

04:35.650 --> 04:41.830
However now both of our heading threes are as a children for two of the dips.

04:42.170 --> 04:44.770
So have parent Dave as well as the second parent.

04:45.350 --> 04:46.610
What about now.

04:46.610 --> 04:49.850
Well I'm gonna go back to a safe house.

04:49.940 --> 04:56.240
I'm going to say for all the divs the font size the base font size shouldn't be let's say I don't know

04:56.680 --> 04:58.080
20 pixels.

04:58.080 --> 05:02.270
So font size they're my property and I'm going to say 20 pixels.

05:02.360 --> 05:05.560
Now what do you think is going to happen notice.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.860
Again this is bigger.

05:06.860 --> 05:11.690
And if I would actually want to maybe prove the point a little bit better I'm going to say 10 pixels.

05:11.840 --> 05:20.450
So right now the ESM is following the fact that the parent has the base size the 10 pixel so it's 1

05:20.450 --> 05:22.800
a.m. or is the right now equal to what.

05:22.820 --> 05:24.990
Well this is equal to a 10 pixel.

05:25.550 --> 05:30.850
So now this font size is in fact 20 pixels because all we're doing is basically multiplying.

05:31.490 --> 05:38.160
So if my base font size is 10 pixels now I multiply by 2 and I'm getting 20 pixels right here.

05:38.450 --> 05:44.000
Then the absolute one doesn't care about that the absolute still stays 32.

05:44.120 --> 05:47.320
So that's the key whenever you're working with the E M values.

05:47.390 --> 05:53.070
Remember that you will gonna be depending on the parent container and if you're changing something in

05:53.070 --> 05:57.970
the parent container that's gonna reflect of what's happening with he e m values.
