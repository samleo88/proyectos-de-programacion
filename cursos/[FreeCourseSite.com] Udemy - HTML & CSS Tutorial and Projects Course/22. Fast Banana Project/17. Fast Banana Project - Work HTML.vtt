WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:06.850
So let's go ahead and let's start working on here with this future project or work section.

00:07.080 --> 00:13.650
So again we're going to go back or here right now we can close or here and so dope but here and there

00:13.820 --> 00:19.170
is going to maybe copy and paste like I don't know the Cdn or something that we don't need to jam back

00:19.200 --> 00:22.430
and forth to the actual isotope website.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.140
Right.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.730
So can just close it over here.

00:24.990 --> 00:31.630
We can go back to index on this and then we can first find out what we need to do right.

00:31.730 --> 00:33.850
Maybe let's go ahead and then right away.

00:33.850 --> 00:35.550
And I said All right.

00:35.580 --> 00:40.850
So I'm going to say go back to the top or here right where we got our CDN.

00:40.890 --> 00:44.820
So this is going to be set up here like this.

00:45.030 --> 00:47.230
And then we're going to copy and paste this.

00:47.310 --> 00:52.600
So I'm going to go back to the e-mail here and we're going to copy and paste it somewhere right.

00:52.630 --> 00:53.260
Right.

00:53.280 --> 00:57.750
So this is going to be the Jack Murray going on here in the bottom we're just going to copy and paste

00:57.750 --> 00:58.730
the isotope.

00:58.750 --> 00:59.270
Right.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.060
So now we have a nice set up.

01:01.130 --> 01:03.780
Well let's say we're here we're going to write a script.

01:03.820 --> 01:04.820
Jeff's right.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.040
This is going to be our script.

01:06.060 --> 01:06.680
Yes.

01:07.140 --> 01:13.380
Then after that once we are done with this let's go ahead and let's actually create a work section so

01:13.380 --> 01:13.990
we're here.

01:14.070 --> 01:20.630
We're going to have in the form so let's comment work section.

01:20.760 --> 01:25.500
Then once we have worked section let's select the line copy and paste.

01:25.750 --> 01:28.050
And we're going to do and of works.

01:28.080 --> 01:35.820
And then once we have this then what we would want is section ID and we're going to say work.

01:36.140 --> 01:40.960
And then what we would want is actually title which really created tile.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.290
And so we don't need to recreate it.

01:43.380 --> 01:43.670
Right.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.760
So let's go ahead and let's see where is skills right.

01:47.850 --> 01:49.630
This is going to be the title.

01:49.650 --> 01:52.380
So what we're going to do is line by line what is going on.

01:52.450 --> 01:53.880
Copy this right.

01:54.090 --> 01:54.850
So c'mon.

01:54.860 --> 01:59.830
See we didn't go down and let's find where is the work section.

01:59.830 --> 02:00.410
All right.

02:00.510 --> 02:03.230
This is going to be the work copy and paste it.

02:03.270 --> 02:04.850
And now we have the title.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.910
Obviously we need to change some values around.

02:06.910 --> 02:07.630
Right.

02:07.680 --> 02:17.380
First of all we're going to have a different I can say I'm going to say hey and so here square here.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.160
Oh my.

02:19.320 --> 02:24.470
First of all this icon is going to be different than over here we're going to say future projects like

02:24.680 --> 02:25.100
this.

02:25.100 --> 02:31.990
And we're going to see if future projects like this future projects like this.

02:32.030 --> 02:37.310
Then once we have this what's actually working on it right on actual works action.

02:37.510 --> 02:37.840
Right.

02:37.840 --> 02:41.530
So here we have future projects titles done right.

02:41.590 --> 02:44.630
And like I said in a sensible action we're going to flip it around right.

02:44.740 --> 02:47.390
But we need to get there first.

02:47.410 --> 02:54.050
So here I'm going to say that first this is going to be a collapse of the class of work.

02:54.220 --> 02:57.710
I'm going to call it Center work center.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.750
Then we're going to have a button container.

03:01.080 --> 03:07.220
So I'm going to say Divx button and this is going to be container press table.

03:07.220 --> 03:09.170
Here now we have a button container.

03:09.340 --> 03:14.330
And now we would want that div that was actually button group and filter button.

03:14.720 --> 03:15.230
Right.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.530
So here what I'm going to say this is going to be a button.

03:18.520 --> 03:19.250
All right.

03:19.260 --> 03:24.430
Dave So I'm going to say bottom group and again we can name it.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.200
However we would want.

03:26.240 --> 03:26.860
All right.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.730
The key right now naming it like this so it's not confusing.

03:30.730 --> 03:30.980
Right.

03:30.970 --> 03:39.190
We're really getting this from now on here I'm going to say another class filter here bottom group right

03:39.190 --> 03:39.480
here.

03:39.600 --> 03:40.120
Right.

03:40.150 --> 03:43.300
And these are the same ones that we actually used previously.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.640
Press time on here.

03:44.740 --> 03:49.050
Now we have a div button group and filter button.

03:49.570 --> 03:52.180
And here we're going to have a button on here.

03:52.480 --> 03:58.450
And for the button we're going to have a data filter that you remember when we were using this right

03:58.500 --> 03:59.780
to actually filter it.

03:59.980 --> 04:02.750
And the first one I'm going to set it equal to star.

04:02.790 --> 04:04.950
I mean because we want to select them all.

04:05.050 --> 04:07.730
And what I'm going to do here is copy and paste this.

04:07.810 --> 04:10.970
So I'm going to settle at the line and I'm not going to have three more.

04:11.080 --> 04:11.460
Right.

04:11.650 --> 04:13.380
So they add a filter.

04:13.390 --> 04:16.370
This one is going to be class city.

04:16.540 --> 04:19.260
This is going to be class country.

04:19.330 --> 04:22.180
This is going to be the types of pictures we're going to have.

04:22.390 --> 04:27.940
This is going to be class of water and oh here we're going to write what the bleep button actually selects

04:28.420 --> 04:29.600
right here.

04:29.620 --> 04:35.310
When you say all this is going to be selecting all then this is going to be selecting city right and

04:35.350 --> 04:37.480
obviously these classes need to match.

04:37.550 --> 04:39.540
Not here I'm going to say country now.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.080
I mean they don't need to match.

04:41.090 --> 04:46.060
But it's not going to make much sense if you're selecting country button but you're actually selecting

04:46.060 --> 04:47.850
water images right.

04:47.940 --> 04:53.000
We're going to say water when we have this and we can save this right too.

04:53.020 --> 04:57.000
Now we have our button group still within our work center.

04:57.220 --> 04:58.860
Let's go back over here.

04:58.930 --> 05:05.180
Actually and our images here what I'm going to say is this is going to be a live picture.

05:05.470 --> 05:09.010
Container container here press them.

05:09.190 --> 05:11.930
And now we can actually add our images.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.600
What I'm going to do is I'm going to wrap the images in article so I'm going to say article article

05:19.050 --> 05:20.930
here and I'm going to press.

05:20.970 --> 05:21.370
Right.

05:21.540 --> 05:23.700
And this is going to be actually class.

05:23.770 --> 05:30.690
I know what I'm going to go to class and I'm going to see a picture item item more here.

05:30.990 --> 05:32.450
And then all I need.

05:32.640 --> 05:39.150
I want to match actually first one of these data right on the first one is going to be city again and

05:39.150 --> 05:44.610
this is important because I would want to select when this button would have this article and you hear

05:44.610 --> 05:48.460
what I'm going to say is this is going to be image here.

05:48.510 --> 05:55.260
And the source is going to be images then we're going to have a project here and you can see how I am

05:55.340 --> 06:01.370
that images project city one might then I suggest doing the same especially if you're duplicating this

06:01.380 --> 06:06.780
right and here when I'm going to do is I'm going to say this is going to be work one and this is just

06:06.780 --> 06:07.960
for alternative.

06:08.110 --> 06:08.340
Right.

06:08.340 --> 06:11.230
We don't really care about much about this right.

06:11.440 --> 06:12.750
But we'll see what happened right.

06:12.770 --> 06:13.260
Right.

06:13.290 --> 06:14.670
So we have to go.

06:14.850 --> 06:16.310
And this is the city.

06:16.380 --> 06:22.470
Now what I would want is actually copy and paste this or you know and this someone to select this hard

06:22.470 --> 06:26.590
to go and I'm going to copy two more times and here what I'm going to do.

06:26.680 --> 06:27.380
All right.

06:27.510 --> 06:33.720
You can see them right now I'm selecting Siri and let me actually use the beautifier just so we can

06:33.720 --> 06:35.460
see better what we are doing right.

06:35.520 --> 06:40.620
So this is going to be silly but this one is going to be country or here.

06:40.730 --> 06:43.240
We are also going to change this value.

06:43.270 --> 06:48.580
The country country or here country right.

06:48.610 --> 06:52.240
This is going to be our country image and they're all here this is going to be our water.

06:52.420 --> 06:59.510
And the important thing is again if you want these images to match they need the classes need to merge.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.920
And over here obviously these values need to watch.

07:01.930 --> 07:05.850
So we're here I'm going to get in water and this is going to be one jetpack.

07:05.850 --> 07:07.170
All right so see what we have.

07:07.330 --> 07:08.840
We have three images right now.

07:08.850 --> 07:09.540
Right.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.790
And what we're going to do right now we're going to copy these three articles actually.

07:13.810 --> 07:14.300
Right.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.800
So this is going to be our container right.

07:16.840 --> 07:19.050
And one is going to copy and paste these articles.

07:19.280 --> 07:25.540
So I'm going to select them one time and second time and now would we would want to do is change the

07:25.540 --> 07:27.340
city to three.

07:27.470 --> 07:27.670
I.

07:27.670 --> 07:33.630
This is going to be city image three country ministry water imagery and all here.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.800
We're going to have a second right.

07:35.830 --> 07:42.590
So this is going to be water image number two country image number two city image number two.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.380
So let's say this let's head back over here.

07:45.580 --> 07:48.880
Let's look at our recording what we have done.

07:49.020 --> 07:51.790
So I could see that I have nine images lining up like this.

07:51.790 --> 07:52.370
Right.

07:52.390 --> 07:56.170
So first one city then country water.

07:56.410 --> 07:59.040
Second City image second country image.

07:59.050 --> 07:59.610
Right.

07:59.620 --> 08:01.430
And so on and so forth.

08:01.780 --> 08:05.700
And this pretty much is it for our HD.

08:05.990 --> 08:10.680
Right now what we would need to do is actually go to see assess and start dialing.
