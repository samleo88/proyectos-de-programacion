WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:00.770
All right.

00:00.780 --> 00:03.890
We have added colors to our sisters tool belt.

00:03.960 --> 00:05.370
What's next.

00:05.370 --> 00:11.220
Our next topic is very interesting because it will control the layout of our project.

00:11.220 --> 00:17.640
So my friends let's get to know units in CSX and we'll start with something called pixels.

00:18.390 --> 00:23.530
Here's the kicker though in order to cover units we're going to have to use them on some properties.

00:23.790 --> 00:27.360
Otherwise we might as well look at the slides for the next three hours.

00:27.450 --> 00:34.950
So let's quickly learn three properties in the CSX font size width and height if you would have to guess.

00:34.950 --> 00:36.650
What do you think these properties control.

00:37.420 --> 00:44.220
Well if I would have to go out on a limb I would say font size is responsible for the size of our fonts

00:44.490 --> 00:49.620
more text and width and height would control the width and height of the elements.

00:50.100 --> 00:51.480
So far so good.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.470
What about pixels.

00:53.310 --> 01:00.120
Well again we can spend two hours and 20 slides or we can resolve it in one sentence answer where pixel

01:00.210 --> 01:03.100
is an absolute unit of measurement.

01:03.300 --> 01:08.600
And speaking very broadly one pixel represents one dot on a screen.

01:08.730 --> 01:13.810
So as you're looking at the screen right now one pixel is basically going to be wonder.

01:14.050 --> 01:18.860
And again this is speaking very broadly because I don't want to spend two hours in line.

01:19.260 --> 01:24.660
Now let's test it out because this is just going to be the easiest way to understand it.

01:24.720 --> 01:30.240
Now as you can see by the way I cleaned everything out in this assassination email because for this

01:30.240 --> 01:32.290
new section I would like to start fresh.

01:32.580 --> 01:38.160
Now again I'm going gonna do very simply where there's gonna be heading one and I'm just gonna say units

01:38.670 --> 01:41.740
in the C assess in the.

01:41.890 --> 01:45.330
So that's gonna be my text and the moment I finish typing.

01:45.330 --> 01:45.930
Awesome.

01:45.930 --> 01:47.660
We have our heading one.

01:47.670 --> 01:49.840
Now I'm gonna head over back to the styles.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.600
We're going to test our first property which would be font size so we know that we can select it in

01:54.600 --> 01:59.800
multiple ways and in my case I'm just gonna pick the elements selected then I'm gonna write.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.350
What kind of font size I would like.

02:01.350 --> 02:02.990
So I'm gonna say font size.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.610
This is gonna be my property and now I'm using the values and as you can see there's many options that

02:08.610 --> 02:10.530
right now Visual Studio code gives us.

02:10.740 --> 02:13.470
But what we are interested is the pixel.

02:13.470 --> 02:18.780
So you're gonna say that let's say this is gonna be 30 pixel NOT CHECK THIS OUT THE MONITOR we're gonna

02:18.780 --> 02:19.490
save it.

02:19.560 --> 02:22.420
This is in fact gonna get smaller knock.

02:22.530 --> 02:24.430
What if we're going to write 60 pixel.

02:24.720 --> 02:29.970
Now my font size is gonna get WAY bigger because I added this absolute value.

02:29.970 --> 02:34.380
Now why did I say that pixels are absolute values of measurement.

02:34.380 --> 02:40.800
Well you see 60 pixels right now what we have here is gonna be 60 pixels here as well as going to be

02:40.800 --> 02:43.150
60 pixels on a different screen.

02:43.550 --> 02:50.400
So the 60 pixels or pixels in general are not going to depend on anything else you're just gonna come

02:50.400 --> 02:56.350
up with your absolute size whatever that might be and then you're just gonna go with.

02:56.350 --> 03:01.830
Now later on as we're looking for Responsive values you'll see how with responsive values we will gonna

03:01.830 --> 03:03.660
be depending on other things.

03:04.170 --> 03:10.290
But with pixels This is just gonna be straight up give me the value for the pixels and these are gonna

03:10.290 --> 03:14.030
be dots on a screen and let's say for the font size it's one thing.

03:14.040 --> 03:14.340
No.

03:14.340 --> 03:15.450
What about the width.

03:15.540 --> 03:19.550
Let's say what if we're gonna say some and with and for the setting one.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.810
Again let me write it properly.

03:21.810 --> 03:25.780
Let's say with is gonna be had I know 200 pixel.

03:25.830 --> 03:31.230
Now let me save it and check this out first of all we can already see that something changed.

03:31.230 --> 03:37.020
So our text basically wrapped to a new light however maybe visually it would be easier if we would use

03:37.020 --> 03:37.950
the color.

03:37.950 --> 03:39.230
So how we can use the color.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.790
Well we already covered this right.

03:41.100 --> 03:44.860
So we had the background and let's say let's go with some kind of color.

03:44.970 --> 03:48.760
Again I'm gonna go with the color name because I find it much more easier.

03:48.780 --> 03:56.340
So I'm gonna say blue and as you can see right now I'm having my in one that is two hundred pixels wide.

03:56.400 --> 04:02.760
And again it would look 200 pixels on a small screen as well as this is gonna be two hundred pixels

04:02.760 --> 04:03.810
on a bigger screen.

04:03.840 --> 04:08.940
So again it's not gonna depend on any parent elements any root elements anything like that.

04:08.940 --> 04:13.880
This is just gonna be straight up value that we're giving you want more with Oh here you go.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.300
I have four 400 pixels.

04:16.380 --> 04:19.140
This is not what I wanted but let me say it properly.

04:19.140 --> 04:24.150
Now this is gonna be 400 pixels again depending on the screen size if I'm going gonna say that this

04:24.150 --> 04:26.160
is gonna be let's say thousand now.

04:26.280 --> 04:31.140
So this is gonna be wrapping up so now we actually need to scroll because this is literally going to

04:31.140 --> 04:33.780
be a thousand pixels so on a smaller screen now.

04:33.870 --> 04:36.250
This is not going to be able to fit in the screen.

04:36.300 --> 04:40.470
However if we move to the bigger screen size everything is working fine.

04:40.470 --> 04:42.500
This is gonna be our thousand pixel.

04:42.570 --> 04:43.630
Now let's test it out.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.720
Also maybe the height and you know what.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.930
Let's change this one too decent 400.

04:48.990 --> 04:50.730
That's gonna stay the same.

04:50.730 --> 04:54.450
So let's say it or you know 400 is still to make.

04:54.450 --> 04:55.790
Let's do 200.

04:55.890 --> 05:01.810
That's gonna be our value and let's maybe add some kind of height and for height we're going to be looking

05:01.810 --> 05:03.990
for height property again.

05:04.030 --> 05:07.350
And in this case we're going to go with 300 pixels.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.150
And again all of these are very straightforward.

05:10.150 --> 05:11.550
You want bigger size.

05:11.620 --> 05:13.190
Just go with bigger size.

05:13.210 --> 05:15.120
Now you don't have to always use pixels.

05:15.130 --> 05:17.620
We will going to cover all the relative values.

05:17.650 --> 05:23.170
However the main importance is to understand that the font size is going to control the height of the

05:23.170 --> 05:23.920
text.

05:24.010 --> 05:29.860
So the bigger obviously the value here the bigger is going to be the text smaller the value you get

05:29.860 --> 05:30.250
an idea.

05:30.790 --> 05:32.490
Now the same would work with with.

05:32.560 --> 05:35.700
Again we're going to be working later on with responsive values.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.750
But you just need to pass some kind of unit here.

05:38.830 --> 05:41.310
In our case we're using the absolute values.

05:41.500 --> 05:46.940
So everything that's showing on a small screen is going to look exactly the same on a bigger screen.

05:47.020 --> 05:49.230
You want different height different height.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.920
You want that different with.

05:50.920 --> 05:55.030
Go ahead had different width and just as a straightforward has it gets.
