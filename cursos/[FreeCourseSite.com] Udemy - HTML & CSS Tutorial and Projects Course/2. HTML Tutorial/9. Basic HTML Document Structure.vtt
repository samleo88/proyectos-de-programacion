00:00.520 --> 00:04.760
Well we are very happy with our first web page as we should be.

00:04.780 --> 00:09.760
It's hard to miss an error message by the life server in the very bottom of the screen.

00:09.880 --> 00:12.630
So there has to be something missing in our page.

00:12.940 --> 00:16.600
Now that something is a proper age the email structure.

00:16.600 --> 00:21.730
So let's take another quick pit stop in the slide wheel to discuss that.

00:21.730 --> 00:28.060
You see all age normal elements follow the same basic structure so that the browser that renders the

00:28.060 --> 00:30.940
file knows what to do at the very top.

00:30.940 --> 00:37.510
We have a dog type declaration that tells the browser what age the animal version of the page is written.

00:38.140 --> 00:45.130
The doctor you see in the slide corresponds to the latest version of the email which is HDMI 5.

00:45.190 --> 00:52.120
Next we have h the email root element that will wrap all our code in the page and will always contain

00:52.120 --> 00:55.380
one had element and one body element.

00:55.380 --> 01:00.810
And notice however things kind of sandwich nested inside each the animal element by the way.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.130
That is really important.

01:02.350 --> 01:09.390
And we'll discuss that in more detail once we head back to texter after each their root element.

01:09.400 --> 01:14.520
We have reached the animal head element that will contain information about the page.

01:14.770 --> 01:22.780
Like for example page title page metadata and links to external resources like CSI style sheets and

01:22.780 --> 01:29.050
JavaScript files content within the header element will not be visible on the page that is being rendered

01:29.770 --> 01:35.620
and with your permission I would like to hold off on covering head element content in any more detail

01:35.980 --> 01:42.370
because at this point in time we have more important business to attend in short head element will contain

01:42.370 --> 01:47.860
information about the page and will not be visible on the page that is being rendered.

01:47.860 --> 01:54.940
Now body element is whole another ballgame because this is where we'll do all of our work like adding

01:54.940 --> 02:00.140
headings paragraphs links and basically creating our fantastic webpage.

02:00.220 --> 02:05.140
Now that we know the basics of HCM or page structure let's implement it.

02:05.140 --> 02:06.400
In our first web page.
