00:00.420 --> 00:06.750
While we're still on the subject of border radius and border margin padding and everything that has

00:06.750 --> 00:14.640
to do with a CSX box model why don't we take a look at some very very nifty property called outline

00:14.790 --> 00:18.180
and you know what orders are going to we're going to use some visual aid.

00:18.180 --> 00:24.720
So again we're going to ride over here CSX out line property something like this and then we're going

00:24.720 --> 00:26.260
to be looking for damages.

00:26.430 --> 00:30.660
Now with the damages we're just going to show you again there's plenty of them you can choose whatever

00:30.660 --> 00:33.900
you'd like but what's happening is that we have the content.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.390
So we already have it where we have the padding.

00:36.510 --> 00:41.700
Then we have the border and then past the border we in fact have the outline and then we're dealing

00:41.700 --> 00:42.630
with the margin.

00:42.630 --> 00:48.040
Now let me see maybe there is a better or a little bit actual image with me checking in for the images.

00:48.090 --> 00:52.270
And let me scroll here is the border content.

00:52.410 --> 00:55.720
Let me see where there is one with a margin maybe.

00:55.740 --> 00:57.440
Yeah I don't think this is gonna be here.

00:57.450 --> 01:01.860
But anyway I just understand that there's still going to be margin right here because remember margin

01:01.860 --> 01:04.470
was kind of behind the border.

01:04.470 --> 01:07.140
So what in fact we're having here is the content.

01:07.140 --> 01:13.180
Then we have the border then we have the outline and eventually we'll have obviously our margin.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.880
Your question probably would be why why does it make sense.

01:16.890 --> 01:22.470
So we are having right now the border and why we care about so much about the outline.

01:23.070 --> 01:29.970
Well we don't carry it like excessively but we can do some pretty nifty things with an outline that

01:29.970 --> 01:31.460
we cannot deal with the border.

01:31.500 --> 01:36.470
And as always you guessed it in order to show you that we're gonna head over back to indexation amount

01:37.660 --> 01:42.310
and here we're gonna say something like along the lines like this there is gonna be a Dave.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.020
Dave is gonna have class.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.710
So the class is gonna be buttons let's say.

01:46.870 --> 01:47.950
And you know what.

01:47.950 --> 01:51.030
Let me spell it correctly as well as within this Dave.

01:51.030 --> 01:56.410
We're gonna have two links now each of the links is gonna have a hashtag so the link is not gonna go

01:56.410 --> 01:56.940
anywhere.

01:57.150 --> 02:02.490
However the first one is gonna have the class of let's say one or you know just to switch it around

02:02.500 --> 02:07.290
let's use the Dave and say this is gonna be Dave I'm sorry what Dave I.D..

02:07.840 --> 02:09.000
Let's use the idea.

02:09.250 --> 02:13.660
And I don't know why I'm using the hashtag because this is something I'm going to have to use in a CSI.

02:13.670 --> 02:15.120
So I'm sorry.

02:15.130 --> 02:18.500
I guess that's what happens if I'm using classes 20 times.

02:18.550 --> 02:26.590
Anyway I want I.D. Now the first one an idea is gonna be one and I'm gonna say is no outline that will

02:26.590 --> 02:29.550
be written in the link and I'm going to copy and paste.

02:29.620 --> 02:33.020
Now for the second one I'm gonna say that this buddy is gonna be number two.

02:33.130 --> 02:35.320
And here this guy is gonna have the outline.

02:35.920 --> 02:36.530
Awesome.

02:36.730 --> 02:39.470
We have everything set up in the limo.

02:39.490 --> 02:40.270
Now what's next.

02:40.270 --> 02:45.700
Well let's start in the buttons in the seats us and let's say for the buttons first of all I would want

02:45.700 --> 02:50.460
some margin and margins is gonna be three are yams or not okay.

02:50.570 --> 02:55.840
It's a very very nice start and then I would like to select both the length and we're gonna add a bunch

02:55.840 --> 03:02.230
of styles just or both of the length and then we specifically work with one of them with the border

03:02.740 --> 03:04.180
and then the other one you guessed it.

03:04.200 --> 03:08.500
Than you use the outline so we're gonna say something like this will you say first of all background

03:08.500 --> 03:11.020
is gonna be some x value.

03:11.110 --> 03:13.730
Six eight nine.

03:13.930 --> 03:17.550
Let's say again hashtag six eight nine.

03:17.650 --> 03:20.030
And then I'm looking for F 3.

03:20.500 --> 03:26.260
Oh gonna be a green color as well as we're gonna be looking for some tax decoration I'm gonna say tax

03:26.260 --> 03:29.070
decoration is gonna be none are patting.

03:29.110 --> 03:37.200
Let's add some padding a little bit let's say one point two resumes and one point five arms as well.

03:37.240 --> 03:42.010
So this is gonna be my panic house up and then we're having the color and the color.

03:42.010 --> 03:42.660
We can do.

03:42.660 --> 03:49.420
I not gonna hex value to do it you know blackish color and you know what we can also do text transform

03:49.420 --> 03:55.260
uppercase XT transform uppercase.

03:55.330 --> 03:59.080
This is gonna be transform navigates and you know what we haven't covered yet.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.440
Display properties.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.730
So let me make this smaller later on we're going to see why this is happening.

04:03.730 --> 04:10.330
But don't worry about it too much right now what we're looking for is the outline properly what else

04:10.330 --> 04:10.870
is happening.

04:10.870 --> 04:12.850
Well now we would want.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.240
I don't know a cursor pointer.

04:15.240 --> 04:19.550
No this is gonna make sure that as we hovering that there's gonna be a little pointer.

04:19.710 --> 04:25.480
Now once we say it check it out what happens as I'm hovering over the links that I'm gonna having this

04:25.480 --> 04:27.010
cursor point mouse.

04:27.130 --> 04:28.780
OK what else.

04:28.780 --> 04:32.350
Now this is the time we're all gonna meet the border again.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.930
Mark we have already met the border.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.510
But I guess we're going to get to know more one more time.

04:37.540 --> 04:43.330
What are we going to write the shortcut and organize a border and for the border at an all zero point

04:43.330 --> 04:44.270
to our aims.

04:44.290 --> 04:46.920
That would be the actual width of the border.

04:47.070 --> 04:50.280
And we're looking for solid and until 2.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.670
OK.

04:51.730 --> 04:59.980
Finally we can start working on our outline an outline is gonna have to be a lot similar the way the

04:59.980 --> 05:01.120
border is.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.590
Meaning if I'm gonna go to the second one I can write like this.

05:04.650 --> 05:09.770
You can say no to here is gonna first and I have some kind of outline with what to do.

05:09.770 --> 05:13.950
Again the same thing zero point two yams.

05:14.020 --> 05:17.430
Then we're gonna have the outline and we're gonna be looking for style.

05:17.470 --> 05:21.400
So in this case again we're going to go on solid just because we want to match exactly the same like

05:21.400 --> 05:25.270
we had here just so you can see that there's a lot of similarities.

05:25.390 --> 05:28.690
And last but not least we're gonna have outline color.

05:28.700 --> 05:35.590
Now once we have these three things and stack two two two you'll see that everything looks exactly the

05:35.590 --> 05:36.700
same.

05:36.700 --> 05:42.360
Now your question probably would be well what is the difference then why you're showing this.

05:42.430 --> 05:46.180
Well what's nifty about the outline is the fact that you know what.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.040
Before we do that and quickly adds a margin.

05:49.300 --> 05:54.850
So margin is going to be for both lengths zero to bottom and then we're going to be looking for like

05:54.850 --> 05:59.910
20 pixels something like this just because they're not actually sitting side by side.

05:59.980 --> 06:03.760
And again I'm struggling because we haven't covered display properties yet.

06:04.420 --> 06:07.190
But the moment we add the outline you might be tempted.

06:07.200 --> 06:07.940
Taking longer.

06:07.990 --> 06:13.370
So that looks exactly the same y y you're going over this while you're covering the outline.

06:13.390 --> 06:18.340
Well first of all I would like to tell yes there's gonna be a lot of similarities because I can do the

06:18.340 --> 06:22.070
shortcut remember how we have the porous border.

06:22.120 --> 06:27.930
So here I can write the same thing I can say outline then whatever styles I had zero point two or three

06:28.240 --> 06:38.200
M's solid yams solid and then I have hashtag to do what's really really nifty though about this property

06:38.710 --> 06:43.490
is the fact that we can use the property of offset how is that going to work.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.720
Well let's see.

06:44.720 --> 06:53.150
So if I'm gonna write here outline offset I'm gonna be able to move this outline whether more out from

06:53.150 --> 06:57.320
the actual button in our case or we can more with more.

06:57.620 --> 07:02.810
So let's say if I'm gonna say that the outline is gonna be 10 pixels notice what's gonna happen.

07:02.840 --> 07:09.790
So now we have nice effect where our border has been actually moved away from currently the elemental

07:09.830 --> 07:10.570
working.

07:10.790 --> 07:14.150
And what's also really cool we can move in the opposite direction.

07:14.150 --> 07:18.860
So if I'm got a company posted an hour slate right now because of the order I'm gonna override this.

07:18.860 --> 07:24.260
And if I'm gonna say negative 10 pixels what happens is right now my outline is gonna be within the

07:24.260 --> 07:24.650
element.

07:25.010 --> 07:28.070
So those are the cool things that we can do without line.

07:28.280 --> 07:33.650
And that is the reason why we would want to know about the border as well as about the outline.
