1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,890
Alright, so, now what we're going to do is

2

00:00:01,890  -->  00:00:05,160
add some more functionality when it

3

00:00:05,160  -->  00:00:09,090
comes to actually modifying the web view

4

00:00:09,090  -->  00:00:11,099
of the current tab, and how we're going

5

00:00:11,099  -->  00:00:12,389
to do that is we need to find our

6

00:00:12,389  -->  00:00:15,360
toolbar here where the address bar is

7

00:00:15,360  -->  00:00:21,539
and we need to set some buttons. So, set

8

00:00:21,539  -->  00:00:25,590
toolbar buttons. So for instance we're

9

00:00:25,590  -->  00:00:28,920
going to have a self.BackButton, and

10

00:00:28,920  -->  00:00:32,790
that's going to be equal to QWidgets.

11

00:00:32,790  -->  00:00:37,440
QPushButton actually, and for right now it's

12

00:00:37,440  -->  00:00:39,989
just going to show a left arrow.

13

00:00:39,989  -->  00:00:50,940
And then self.ForwardButton = QPushButton

14

00:00:50,940  -->  00:00:53,640
button, and it's going to show a right

15

00:00:53,640  -->  00:00:56,760
arrow. And what we need to do is now

16

00:00:56,760  -->  00:00:59,100
connect these two methods that will make

17

00:00:59,100  -->  00:01:01,020
the current web view go back and forward,

18

00:01:01,020  -->  00:01:09,090
and so self.BackButton.clicked.connect and

19

00:01:09,090  -->  00:01:11,040
we're going to connect it to self.

20

00:01:11,040  -->  00:01:14,820
GoBack.

21

00:01:14,820  -->  00:01:18,990
Same thing for forward. self.Forward

22

00:01:18,990  -->  00:01:22,590
Button.clicked, going to connect that

23

00:01:22,590  -->  00:01:28,259
signal to self.GoForward. And we

24

00:01:28,259  -->  00:01:30,750
don't need to worry about what tab

25

00:01:30,750  -->  00:01:33,720
we were on when we clicked these buttons

26

00:01:33,720  -->  00:01:36,750
because these are global buttons, but we do

27

00:01:36,750  -->  00:01:39,990
need to get the active tab once these

28

00:01:39,990  -->  00:01:42,299
are clicked. But, before we even do that we

29

00:01:42,299  -->  00:01:44,790
need to add the buttons to the toolbar.

30

00:01:44,790  -->  00:01:49,710
So, self.ToolbarLayout.addWidget, and we're

31

00:01:49,710  -->  00:01:54,420
going to add self.BackButton. And then

32

00:01:54,420  -->  00:01:58,770
under that, self.ToolbarLayout, add

33

00:01:58,770  -->  00:02:00,869
Widget, and we're going to add self.

34

00:02:00,869  -->  00:02:06,930
ForwardButton. So I'm going to save

35

00:02:06,930  -->  00:02:09,060
this, and basically at this point we

36

00:02:09,060  -->  00:02:10,890
should have a toolbar that has a back

37

00:02:10,890  -->  00:02:12,730
button, a forward button,

38

00:02:12,730  -->  00:02:15,519
an address bar, and the add tab button. Let's go

39

00:02:15,519  -->  00:02:18,970
ahead and run the application, and we

40

00:02:18,970  -->  00:02:20,500
actually need to create these methods

41

00:02:20,500  -->  00:02:21,549
before it will work.

42

00:02:21,549  -->  00:02:24,040
So let's drop down here, and let's just

43

00:02:24,040  -->  00:02:29,580
create them, I guess. So,

44

00:02:29,680  -->  00:02:45,849
GoBack, pass, and def GoForward, pass. It

45

00:02:45,849  -->  00:02:48,129
would be awesome if I could type today. I

46

00:02:48,129  -->  00:02:50,019
must be sitting angled just

47

00:02:50,019  -->  00:02:52,299
incorrectly. So as you can see now we've

48

00:02:52,299  -->  00:02:54,250
got a back button and a forward button

49

00:02:54,250  -->  00:02:57,489
there actually rigged to the

50

00:02:57,489  -->  00:02:59,590
functions that we just created, but they

51

00:02:59,590  -->  00:03:00,940
don't actually do anything yet. So what

52

00:03:00,940  -->  00:03:03,700
we need to do is get the current tab, or

53

00:03:03,700  -->  00:03:06,069
active tab when we click these, and we

54

00:03:06,069  -->  00:03:09,069
need to get the object with the object

55

00:03:09,069  -->  00:03:13,000
name equal to this tab data object, and

56

00:03:13,000  -->  00:03:14,680
then we can tell this web view to go back.

57

00:03:14,680  -->  00:03:18,010
So, it sounds more complicated than it is,

58

00:03:18,010  -->  00:03:23,829
but all it is, is active index, so this is

59

00:03:23,829  -->  00:03:25,750
going to be the active tabs index number

60

00:03:25,750  -->  00:03:37,870
is self.tabbar.getCurrentIndex, or

61

00:03:37,870  -->  00:03:39,519
just currentIndex.

62

00:03:39,519  -->  00:03:42,730
So this is going to tell us what tab is

63

00:03:42,730  -->  00:03:44,410
currently active. Now at that point we

64

00:03:44,410  -->  00:03:48,549
need to get the tab name, so it's going to be

65

00:03:48,549  -->  00:03:52,480
equal to activeIndex, actually

66

00:03:52,480  -->  00:03:56,230
equal to self.tabbar.

67

00:03:56,230  -->  00:04:03,900
tapData(activeIndex),

68

00:04:05,750  -->  00:04:09,920
and then object. So this is the object

69

00:04:09,920  -->  00:04:16,160
key within the tab data property. And

70

00:04:16,160  -->  00:04:18,950
then what we need to do is we need to

71

00:04:18,950  -->  00:04:24,350
get the object of the tabs, so tab_content

72

00:04:24,350  -->  00:04:29,810
equals self.findChild, we're looking for

73

00:04:29,810  -->  00:04:34,970
a QWidget with the name tab_name, and then

74

00:04:34,970  -->  00:04:36,860
we're going to access content here. So,

75

00:04:36,860  -->  00:04:40,040
this is the actual web view, and then all

76

00:04:40,040  -->  00:04:43,220
we need to do is type tab_content.

77

00:04:43,220  -->  00:04:50,510
goBack. Let's go ahead and restart this, and

78

00:04:50,510  -->  00:04:57,200
let's start by going to a few websites.

79

00:04:57,200  -->  00:05:00,290
So the first one we're on is Google, let's go to

80

00:05:00,290  -->  00:05:08,810
Facebook, let's go to YouTube, and let's

81

00:05:08,810  -->  00:05:15,290
go back...webengine, okay. We actually need to

82

00:05:15,290  -->  00:05:19,610
access page in here. So the web engine

83

00:05:19,610  -->  00:05:20,570
view

84

00:05:20,570  -->  00:05:24,050
has a property called page which is

85

00:05:24,050  -->  00:05:27,590
equal to a web engine page, and with a

86

00:05:27,590  -->  00:05:30,740
web engine page you can do stuff like this. So, let's go

87

00:05:30,740  -->  00:05:37,910
ahead and load this, no. Is it just called

88

00:05:37,910  -->  00:05:39,290
back?

89

00:05:39,290  -->  00:05:41,390
I got something wrong. I might have to search this

90

00:05:41,390  -->  00:05:43,960
here in a moment.

91

00:05:46,490  -->  00:05:53,090
Ok, if this doesn't work, if it isn't in

92

00:05:53,090  -->  00:05:54,650
the actual content, then I'm just going to

93

00:05:54,650  -->  00:05:56,000
go ahead and search it.

94

00:05:56,000  -->  00:06:02,150
Okay, that looks like it works. So,

95

00:06:02,150  -->  00:06:08,210
facebook.com, and then hit back, and it goes

96

00:06:08,210  -->  00:06:10,699
to Google. Alright, now the address bar

97

00:06:10,699  -->  00:06:11,960
doesn't update yet and we're going to get to

98

00:06:11,960  -->  00:06:15,830
that in a moment as well. I just want to make

99

00:06:15,830  -->  00:06:17,900
sure this works. So, we're already on

100

00:06:17,900  -->  00:06:22,669
Google so let's go to youtube.com, and

101

00:06:22,669  -->  00:06:24,620
then once we're on youtube.com let's go

102

00:06:24,620  -->  00:06:32,870
to digg.com. Now if I go back it goes

103

00:06:32,870  -->  00:06:36,590
back to youtube, and then to Google. So

104

00:06:36,590  -->  00:06:39,259
that's working. Essentially, the forward

105

00:06:39,259  -->  00:06:41,539
method is the exact same. So we get the

106

00:06:41,539  -->  00:06:50,000
active tab's index number, then we get the

107

00:06:50,000  -->  00:06:52,159
name of that tab that we need to

108

00:06:52,159  -->  00:06:55,340
actually get the content from, so self.

109

00:06:55,340  -->  00:06:59,240
tabbar.tabData, and then the

110

00:06:59,240  -->  00:07:01,880
tab data we're trying to access is of

111

00:07:01,880  -->  00:07:06,380
the active tab, and then we get the object

112

00:07:06,380  -->  00:07:14,750
key value of the tabs data. Now let's get

113

00:07:14,750  -->  00:07:20,810
tab_content equals selfs.findChild,

114

00:07:20,810  -->  00:07:25,099
QWidget, tap_name.

115

00:07:25,099  -->  00:07:33,460
content, and then tab_content.forward.

116

00:07:35,930  -->  00:07:43,940
So, if I go to facebook.com, and then

117

00:07:43,940  -->  00:07:47,180
youtube.com, now I should be able to

118

00:07:47,180  -->  00:07:48,860
navigate between these however many

119

00:07:48,860  -->  00:07:51,229
times I want simply by using the back

120

00:07:51,229  -->  00:07:57,229
and forward buttons. And it looks like

121

00:07:57,229  -->  00:08:01,550
that is the case. However, the address

122

00:08:01,550  -->  00:08:04,039
bar still isn't getting set. Before

123

00:08:04,039  -->  00:08:05,660
we do that I want to talk about the

124

00:08:05,660  -->  00:08:11,419
reload function, and so let me come up

125

00:08:11,419  -->  00:08:13,729
here to the buttons. We need to create a

126

00:08:13,729  -->  00:08:18,919
reload button, so self.ReloadButton, and

127

00:08:18,919  -->  00:08:20,990
it's going to be equal to QPushButton,

128

00:08:20,990  -->  00:08:23,449
and for now it's going to be a capital

129

00:08:23,449  -->  00:08:25,250
"R" because we're not going through and

130

00:08:25,250  -->  00:08:27,830
adding icons to these buttons. We will go

131

00:08:27,830  -->  00:08:29,479
over that at some point I'm sure.

132

00:08:29,479  -->  00:08:33,020
So, when you click the reload button

133

00:08:33,020  -->  00:08:34,700
we're going to connect that to self.

134

00:08:34,700  -->  00:08:46,400
Reload, ReloadPage. And then drop

135

00:08:46,400  -->  00:08:48,110
down here to under the back and forward

136

00:08:48,110  -->  00:08:54,110
methods, and let's define ReloadPage,

137

00:08:54,110  -->  00:08:58,430
and the same thing the active tabs

138

00:08:58,430  -->  00:09:04,730
index equals self.tabbar.

139

00:09:04,730  -->  00:09:09,380
currentIndex. The tab_name is going to equal

140

00:09:09,380  -->  00:09:13,670
self.tabbar.tabData of the active

141

00:09:13,670  -->  00:09:15,920
index, and the tab data we're

142

00:09:15,920  -->  00:09:18,440
specifically interested in is it's object

143

00:09:18,440  -->  00:09:26,420
key value, and then tab_content equals

144

00:09:26,420  -->  00:09:30,320
self.findChild,

145

00:09:30,320  -->  00:09:34,279
QWidget we are looking for with tab_name,

146

00:09:34,279  -->  00:09:36,709
and we're looking for the content

147

00:09:36,709  -->  00:09:41,300
attribute, and then tab_content.reload.

148

00:09:41,300  -->  00:09:45,470
So, I think we need to add that button

149

00:09:45,470  -->  00:09:48,850
to the toolbar as well, I don't think we did that.

150

00:09:48,850  -->  00:09:53,500
So self.ToolbarLayout.

151

00:09:53,500  -->  00:09:59,440
addWidget(self.ReloadButton).

152

00:09:59,440  -->  00:10:03,339
Save this, re-run our application, and we

153

00:10:03,339  -->  00:10:05,319
now have a reload button. If I click it,

154

00:10:05,319  -->  00:10:10,420
it reloads, and that's all for this video.

155

00:10:10,420  -->  00:10:13,720
So, I look forward to seeing you guys

156

00:10:13,720  -->  00:10:18,100
again, and let's get into more stuff with

157

00:10:18,100  -->  00:10:20,639
web view.
