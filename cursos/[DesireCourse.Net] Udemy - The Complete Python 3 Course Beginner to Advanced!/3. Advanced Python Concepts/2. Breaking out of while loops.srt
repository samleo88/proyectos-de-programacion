1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,180
Alright, so what we're going to talk
about now is some while loop additional

2

00:00:06,180  -->  00:00:12,900
functions, or additional handlers let's
say. So I've created a project here

3

00:00:12,900  -->  00:00:17,580
called attack and i'm just going to
create a new Python file again called

4

00:00:17,580  -->  00:00:23,130
attack, and what this is gonna do think
of think this as a part of a

5

00:00:23,130  -->  00:00:27,090
battle system. So this is just going to
be very straightforward and very simple

6

00:00:27,090  -->  00:00:30,929
right now, but actually when we get to
the end of this section or module of videos

7

00:00:30,929  -->  00:00:36,239
we are going to be creating an entire
battle system using what we're going to

8

00:00:36,239  -->  00:00:40,440
be learning in the next few videos as well
about classes, and whatnot. So, for right

9

00:00:40,440  -->  00:00:47,460
now let's just go ahead and talk about
how to handle certain attacks and stuff. So, the

10

00:00:47,460  -->  00:00:55,980
first thing we're going to do is create
a variable called a "playerhp = 260"

11

00:00:55,980  -->  00:01:02,879
to be equal to let's say 260. Now we're
going to create an enemy attack power, so

12

00:01:02,879  -->  00:01:14,010
what we're going to do is just set the
"enemyatk = 60" and

13

00:01:14,010  -->  00:01:21,509
this is going to be, actually let's
create a range for enemy attack. So

14

00:01:21,509  -->  00:01:27,330
"enemyatkl = 60" and then

15

00:01:27,330  -->  00:01:32,250
"enemyatkh = 80" So this is
going to be used to create a random

16

00:01:32,250  -->  00:01:37,200
number between these two values. So what we're going to do we're going to

17

00:01:37,200  -->  00:01:45,810
actually have to import random, so "import random" I nearly spilled my coffee there.

18

00:01:47,130  -->  00:01:53,610
Alright, so what we're going to do is we're
going to generate a random attack power

19

00:01:53,610  -->  00:02:00,360
between 60 and 80 on each attack, I guess, so we need to create a while

20

00:02:00,360  -->  00:02:10,140
loop. So let's go ahead and say "while
playerhp &gt; 0:" so as

21

00:02:10,140  -->  00:02:12,310
long as the player has health

22

00:02:12,310  -->  00:02:20,110
they're going to be attacked. So, let's go
ahead and say, let's first generate the

23

00:02:20,110  -->  00:02:28,420
attack power. So how we do that is by
using the random range.

24

00:02:28,420  -->  00:02:35,650
Hold on let me open a terminal right quick.

25

00:02:35,650  -->  00:02:42,670
Okay, that's random range, cool. So, "random.randrange( )" and we're going to enter two

26

00:02:42,670  -->  00:02:47,500
numbers here, and the first number is
going to be the starting point, and the

27

00:02:47,500  -->  00:02:52,930
second number is going to be the high
point. So let's go ahead and enter

28

00:02:52,930  -->  00:02:56,650
"enemyatkl, enemyatkh)"

29

00:02:57,280  -->  00:03:07,120
So, we're going to assign this to a
variable of "dmg =" for damage, so this is going

30

00:03:07,120  -->  00:03:10,870
to be the damage that the player takes.
So what we're going to do is we're going

31

00:03:10,870  -->  00:03:17,380
to take the player HP and we're going to
subtract damage from it. So, let's go

32

00:03:17,380  -->  00:03:28,090
ahead and new HP, actually let's just set
it to player HP, so "playerhp = playerhp

33

00:03:28,090  -->  00:03:39,310
- dmg" So let's go ahead and
now make a print statement, so

34

00:03:39,310  -->  00:03:52,870
"print("Enemy strikes for", dmg, "points of
damage.

35

00:03:53,560  -->  00:04:12,190
Current HP is", playerhp)" So this is going to work right down to

36

00:04:12,190  -->  00:04:22,270
the point where the players HP is a zero.
So if it becomes 0, or less than 0, it's

37

00:04:22,270  -->  00:04:25,210
going to stop the loop.

38

00:04:25,210  -->  00:04:30,850
So what we can do is we can save this right now. Let's go ahead and configure a run

39

00:04:30,850  -->  00:04:43,180
here, there. So what we see here is the
first attack enemy strikes for 77 points

40

00:04:43,180  -->  00:04:49,360
of damage, current HP is 183. Then enemy strikes for 73, current HP is 110, etc. and

41

00:04:49,360  -->  00:04:55,150
this goes right down to the point where
his health becomes negative -30. Now, what

42

00:04:55,150  -->  00:04:59,590
we want to do here we want to actually
handle this a bit, so what we can do is

43

00:04:59,590  -->  00:05:23,050
"if playerhp &lt;=0:" "playerhp = 0" Let's go ahead and

44

00:05:23,050  -->  00:05:27,280
save this again, and this is going to make
it so that if it does go down to

45

00:05:27,280  -->  00:05:32,500
-30 it's just going to say it's 0. So let's go ahead and

46

00:05:32,500  -->  00:05:39,580
rerun this and we're going to see that
does actually take effect. So if it's

47

00:05:39,580  -->  00:05:47,349
zero, "if playerhp == 0:"

48

00:05:47,349  -->  00:05:54,070
we're going to print out another message
"print("You have died.

49

00:05:54,580  -->  00:06:10,120
You cannot respawn, as you are dead.")" My fingers do not want to type today.

50

00:06:10,659  -->  00:06:15,849
We rerun it and you can see what
happens you you would be able to guess

51

00:06:15,849  -->  00:06:21,430
what happens, however this will work as a
basic while loop and this would work for

52

00:06:21,430  -->  00:06:22,599
an attack process, but

53

00:06:22,599  -->  00:06:26,620
let's say in the game we're making we
don't want the players help to be able

54

00:06:26,620  -->  00:06:31,570
to reach zero because that's immersion breaking. So what we want to

55

00:06:31,570  -->  00:06:35,440
happen is if the players HP gets low,

56

00:06:36,219  -->  00:06:38,220
they will be

57

00:06:38,220  -->  00:06:43,590
magically teleported to the nearest
medical center, or inn if it's in a

58

00:06:43,590  -->  00:06:47,040
fantasy type of role playing game. So
let's go ahead and do that.

59

00:06:47,040  -->  00:06:54,960
So, what we need to do is, let me see here, if player HP less than or equal,

60

00:06:55,560  -->  00:07:07,080
"if playerhp &lt;= 30" ok. So we're going to set a minimum hit points here of 30. So if it's

61

00:07:07,080  -->  00:07:11,310
30 we're going to do something, if it's
not 30 we're going to do something else.

62

00:07:16,440  -->  00:07:21,660
So what we're going to do here is we're going to print, actually we're going to print

63

00:07:21,660  -->  00:07:39,090
the same thing, so let's go ahead and
copy this, move this. Actually, so we're

64

00:07:39,090  -->  00:07:42,630
still going to print out this statement
because we still want to see the HP

65

00:07:42,630  -->  00:07:45,720
update and whatnot, but then we're
going to do down here is we're going to

66

00:07:45,720  -->  00:07:47,669
say "if player hp == 30:"

67

00:07:47,669  -->  00:08:01,440
let's "print("You have low health. You've been teleported to the

68

00:08:01,440  -->  00:08:05,490
nearest inn.") So if we save this,

69

00:08:06,120  -->  00:08:13,410
there we go. It's going to continuously
run and that's a problem because

70

00:08:13,410  -->  00:08:21,000
what happens is we say as long as player
HP is more than zero do all this, but

71

00:08:21,000  -->  00:08:25,020
then we reach a point where we don't
allow the players HP to reach zero and

72

00:08:25,020  -->  00:08:30,720
this is why we need a break. So let's go
ahead and add this in here. All you need

73

00:08:30,720  -->  00:08:35,880
to do is literally call the word "break"
let's rerun this and it should not

74

00:08:35,880  -->  00:08:39,960
endlessly run, and you can see that's
that's what happened, so.

75

00:08:40,649  -->  00:08:45,240
So what it does basically again let's go
through this from the top. We're importing

76

00:08:45,240  -->  00:08:50,670
random here so that we can generate a
random number between two values, so the

77

00:08:50,670  -->  00:08:54,959
two values that were generating is the
low attack power which is 60 and high

78

00:08:54,959  -->  00:09:00,089
attack power which is 80. We're setting
the players hit points by default to 260.

79

00:09:00,089  -->  00:09:03,720
Then we're actually creating the loop
here, so what we're doing is we're saying

80

00:09:03,720  -->  00:09:10,829
while player HP is more than 0, do
this, and in here we generate the damage,

81

00:09:10,829  -->  00:09:16,949
we calculate the players new HP, and then
we say if it's less than or equal

82

00:09:16,949  -->  00:09:23,550
to 30 it's going to be equal to 30, and
then we do this so we print the

83

00:09:23,550  -->  00:09:30,509
basically the attack details, and then we
say if player HP is 30, because that's

84

00:09:30,509  -->  00:09:35,369
the lowest it can go right here, then we
say you have low health, etc., and then we

85

00:09:35,369  -->  00:09:41,699
break out of the while loop. So that's
how to use the break statement in a

86

00:09:41,699  -->  00:09:46,439
while loop, in the next video we're going
to be going a bit further into this

87

00:09:46,439  -->  00:09:47,040
while loop.

88

00:09:47,040  -->  00:09:50,370
We're going to be using the keyword,
continue.
