WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:02.890
Nor do any kind of web development.

00:03.020 --> 00:04.760
We for sure will need two things.

00:05.330 --> 00:10.590
A text editor to create our project and a web browser to test our results.

00:10.610 --> 00:16.660
While there are many options out there for this course we'll use Google Chrome as our web browser and

00:16.670 --> 00:19.670
Visual Studio code has our text there.

00:19.820 --> 00:25.760
While I can go on and on about why you should pick these two specific tools in a short one sentence

00:25.760 --> 00:32.960
answer both of them are industry leaders and first wants to implement new features and by doing so improve

00:32.960 --> 00:40.490
our workflow and overall development experience both of them are for free and require simple download.

00:40.490 --> 00:46.610
While this is not a requirement meaning you can use other browser and text are to your liking.

00:46.610 --> 00:52.310
If you want the same exact results during the course as me I would suggest downloading these two tools.
