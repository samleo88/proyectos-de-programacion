WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:06.440
As always before we can start building anything we actually need to do our set up.

00:06.440 --> 00:12.990
So we're here and that's going to create a new folder and I'm going to call this a music app so I'm

00:12.990 --> 00:17.750
going to say over here and this is going to be a music app on this.

00:17.820 --> 00:22.440
And let me just rename it music up here.

00:22.560 --> 00:28.110
Then once I have this open that I'm going to open the brackets here and I'm going to close these ones

00:28.110 --> 00:29.070
for now.

00:29.070 --> 00:35.130
So I'm going to get I'm a text editor and I'm just going to drag this folder over here.

00:35.340 --> 00:37.270
And this pretty much is going to.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.130
All right.

00:38.150 --> 00:39.960
We're having that before.

00:39.960 --> 00:43.980
All right so this is going to be a completely empty folder.

00:44.130 --> 00:50.730
Then over here I'm going to say no this is going to be a index actually i'm how you know this then I'm

00:50.730 --> 00:58.390
going to write a way place a H.T. Moscow in full human skeleton and we're going to write a way and mean

00:58.600 --> 01:00.050
CSSA over here.

01:00.300 --> 01:08.380
So now that I have the indexation Amendment right away I can have a live preview on this.

01:08.400 --> 01:15.350
So once we have the live preview then let's create a main see it says which is going to be for styling.

01:15.740 --> 01:21.630
And she says that all readers is also going to be Mencius us in the next one.

01:21.870 --> 01:22.380
That's right.

01:22.380 --> 01:30.120
So we're going to say main success we're here we're going to call this a music app music here.

01:30.330 --> 01:33.230
Then we're also going to have our script.

01:33.230 --> 01:35.620
So I'm going to say we're here and this is going to be script.

01:35.810 --> 01:38.370
Jay has filed an order here.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.320
We're going to have a query.

01:40.530 --> 01:45.430
Right so what just make a comment on whether there's going to be a query.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.930
So let's make the comment over here.

01:47.940 --> 01:53.910
I'm going to say this is going to be Jake where now once we have all heard this initial set up right

01:53.910 --> 01:57.240
with the mates he says now maybe let's do a script.

01:57.240 --> 02:03.900
Julius also scrubbed here overhearing this and I will go ahead and let's start adding what we would

02:03.900 --> 02:04.850
want.

02:04.860 --> 02:07.580
So first we're going to do with fonts.

02:07.720 --> 02:08.830
Just go to Google.

02:08.850 --> 02:13.820
We're going to get font and let's get something quite funky.

02:13.820 --> 02:17.210
All right so let's do thickness right on this.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.620
And you know what.

02:18.620 --> 02:20.980
No that wasn't a number of styles.

02:20.990 --> 02:25.890
What was the thickness and what do slant and so words do or he this guy.

02:26.210 --> 02:28.050
Right so I'm going to press it on here.

02:28.260 --> 02:31.830
Now this tells me how I can add it to my project.

02:32.040 --> 02:35.720
So I'm going to select this copy and paste this and go back.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.590
And now I can close the screen just for now.

02:38.860 --> 02:44.700
I here we're going to say that this is going to be a Google font's and you can see that I puts the comment

02:44.700 --> 02:47.560
in the wrong place on Google.

02:47.670 --> 02:55.530
I'm going to say fonts we have Google fonts we just copy and paste this here and let's place a heading

02:55.530 --> 03:00.930
one just to test that slogan to say hello world and you can see that it's not working yet because I

03:00.930 --> 03:08.040
haven't added a rule to my body so I'm going to save this and I'm really going to get this guy and it's

03:08.040 --> 03:10.090
all going to copy and paste this.

03:10.170 --> 03:11.910
I'm going to go to Maine see assess.

03:12.060 --> 03:16.390
I'm going to say for the whole body I'd copy and paste from family on here.

03:16.740 --> 03:17.570
Right.

03:17.760 --> 03:21.910
And then I'll go ahead and let's maybe actually refresh.

03:22.020 --> 03:24.200
Now I can see that everything is working.

03:24.300 --> 03:28.150
So we have our Hello world and we are fans.

03:28.430 --> 03:35.140
Now the next one we would want is actually Jacquard right because we're here for these buttons.

03:35.370 --> 03:37.130
We're going to need a javascript.

03:37.330 --> 03:43.050
It's all going to get Actually Jake we're in order to do that so we can close all these Google fonts

03:43.560 --> 03:51.840
and we can go here and we're going to use a Google J.A.G. CDN So we just hope and this and we're going

03:51.840 --> 03:59.960
to find words or Genk worry or here just get this Jake worry here and we're going to go back and just

03:59.970 --> 04:06.860
copy and paste this and months maybe like create another comment I'm going to say this is going to be

04:06.870 --> 04:08.050
script file.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.050
Right just so there's a distinction between them.

04:11.100 --> 04:13.830
Now what I would want to do is test whether I actually have Jake.

04:13.830 --> 04:14.690
All right.

04:15.060 --> 04:21.150
So I'm going to go over here and since I have the access right now Jake worry I have an access to function

04:21.570 --> 04:25.270
so I'm going to select the whole document like this right.

04:25.290 --> 04:26.700
I'm going to say document.

04:26.880 --> 04:34.080
And then over here I'm going to write already you know this then I have a Prentice's curly braces and

04:34.080 --> 04:36.330
all over here I need to write a function.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.460
I'm turning right and this is going to be anonymous function.

04:39.720 --> 04:42.350
And then over here let's write just a simple I don't know.

04:42.350 --> 04:45.950
Alert alert here.

04:46.110 --> 04:48.140
Hello hello there.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.210
Hello there.

04:49.230 --> 04:49.980
We're here.

04:50.160 --> 04:54.190
Once we say this you can see that I have a alert with Hello there.

04:54.450 --> 04:55.690
All right so everything is working.

04:55.690 --> 04:57.000
We have our Jake Weary.

04:57.180 --> 05:05.400
And basically what this means is that I'm saying I would want to run my code only when the actual Dom

05:05.400 --> 05:06.460
has been loaded.

05:06.540 --> 05:06.830
Right.

05:06.840 --> 05:10.310
When the document is ready this is the ready function.

05:10.520 --> 05:14.700
So I'm going to delete this alert it because we don't need it right now we know that it's working.

05:14.700 --> 05:17.400
How are we going to be placing all our code here.

05:17.400 --> 05:17.760
Right.

05:17.780 --> 05:22.970
And basically what we're saying is that we would want our code to run only one document has been loaded.

05:23.250 --> 05:28.710
So I'm going to say this and I'm going to go back to actually now and then we'll check what else we

05:28.710 --> 05:28.940
need.

05:28.950 --> 05:29.420
Right.

05:29.580 --> 05:34.930
And the next thing we need is phantasm and the latest version is found on some five.

05:34.950 --> 05:39.520
So here the first thing that we can right away do is get download free.

05:39.550 --> 05:46.430
Now if you are used to working with an all right you can head over here Word says old $4.7.

05:46.470 --> 05:46.970
Right.

05:47.010 --> 05:49.090
And you going to be taking back to the old page.

05:49.110 --> 05:49.500
Right.

05:49.620 --> 05:52.680
But we're going to be working with a fantastic amphi right.

05:52.680 --> 05:57.180
So that's where we're going to be working or here right away with these down don't forget now we're

05:57.180 --> 06:01.790
here they say to get started what would you need to do.

06:01.800 --> 06:08.220
They are using with as 3G javascript and they are for you or here just free CDN but we're not going

06:08.220 --> 06:09.000
to use them.

06:09.200 --> 06:15.060
And then once you download you we're going to have a squeegee with us then in jazz you're going to have

06:15.060 --> 06:17.090
found us some are just fine.

06:17.320 --> 06:23.820
You you've got your head and you add a script right with the source to that font that has some jazz

06:23.820 --> 06:24.480
file over here.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.040
Right.

06:25.050 --> 06:27.280
So let's go ahead and let's actually do it.

06:27.330 --> 06:30.060
So we're going to go here I'm going to find where's my downloads.

06:30.060 --> 06:32.640
There should be already a few of them there.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.350
So I'm going to have downloads right.

06:34.350 --> 06:38.060
And sure enough I have found that semi-valid curso was right.

06:38.070 --> 06:39.320
So let's go here.

06:39.540 --> 06:44.710
And you know what let me just quickly move all this to the trash.

06:44.770 --> 06:45.210
Right.

06:45.240 --> 06:48.660
So it's not in our way and we have found ourselves up for it.

06:48.750 --> 06:54.510
We open up the zip code here like this and then we should have a folder on it once we have the folder

06:54.690 --> 07:01.920
we open it up and we're starting to have a look where it is Rigi with Julius go here then we go to J.S.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.690
and then we have fun Tarsem all day.

07:04.890 --> 07:10.050
Now we can drag it or we can copy this one right and so but I'm going to do it here as I'm going to

07:10.050 --> 07:13.610
select this file and I'm just going to drag it to my music.

07:14.280 --> 07:20.650
Once I have it in my hand up front of some genius I'm going to go over here and in the head.

07:20.770 --> 07:26.340
All right we're going to have a fun time some jackass so I'm going to say script or you know let's do

07:26.340 --> 07:27.220
a comic.

07:27.390 --> 07:32.210
All right let's say Fonte awesome going on here.

07:32.250 --> 07:39.300
We're going to say that this is going to be a script I'm here and we going to say source and the source

07:39.300 --> 07:43.140
is going to be fantastic and Mongia is now in order to test this.

07:43.200 --> 07:51.140
What's create or hear a phantasm Michael it's all going to say hey and in the new syntax we need to

07:51.140 --> 07:58.100
write f hey yes right here and there we're going to write home and we're going to have a let's say 5

07:58.100 --> 07:59.400
x y.

07:59.660 --> 08:04.810
So here we're going to test this why this is not actually working maybe we will refresh.

08:04.820 --> 08:06.170
Now I can see that everything is fine.

08:06.200 --> 08:06.600
Right.

08:06.800 --> 08:11.020
So we'll have our Hello world and we have our fantastic Mica.

08:11.140 --> 08:19.610
Now if we're going to go back over here and go all the way up to how to use it you're able to see what

08:19.610 --> 08:20.610
they're asking right now.

08:20.630 --> 08:21.150
Right.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.170
And like I said the difference with the style free fix right.

08:24.290 --> 08:29.240
We have a solid one which would be for us and then we have bronze.

08:29.300 --> 08:36.770
So FHB So this would be a different thing or here you can see that right if a prefix has been depreciated.

08:36.770 --> 08:38.010
Right and the version 5.

08:38.180 --> 08:42.280
So you remember in all the way you would read just F.A. NFA.

08:42.560 --> 08:45.370
Now that's enough with a phantasm.

08:45.500 --> 08:45.750
Right.

08:45.830 --> 08:50.090
Because we're all going to be working with them we're going to have we're going to look at the prefixes

08:50.090 --> 08:54.370
read or hear the images were packed cells.

08:54.470 --> 08:59.780
So I just read on him music and you can see that I misspelled it for you right.

08:59.780 --> 09:01.050
Music right.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.260
Well these would be the images that I'm using.

09:03.440 --> 09:03.640
Right.

09:03.650 --> 09:07.610
But obviously I'm going to include the images files so you can download it if you want.

09:07.610 --> 09:08.030
All right.

09:08.240 --> 09:15.260
So again I would say just pixels to get all your images because I think it's a very good site and provides

09:15.260 --> 09:20.880
a lot of great content then with the colors we can use a color.

09:21.040 --> 09:24.830
But no here like always this is the generator right.

09:25.070 --> 09:32.110
We just press tab and it gives us colors and then if we want we can lock the color right and keep looking.

09:32.120 --> 09:38.900
We already have covered this a few times and then after that we're going to have a logo right and the

09:38.900 --> 09:42.500
logo here is going to be free logo design.

09:42.500 --> 09:46.580
I'm going to go here and I'm going to look at what logo would want right.

09:46.580 --> 09:49.210
So these are a few options that actually have more.

09:49.220 --> 09:52.980
So we're going to have a new logos here.

09:53.360 --> 09:57.380
And then once we would say pick whatever you want.

09:57.370 --> 09:57.680
Right.

09:57.680 --> 10:03.210
So let's say we're here food and drink then you can see or hear these logos they offer.

10:03.410 --> 10:11.180
Now you're not limited to only this look obviously right which you can do here is you can actually customize

10:11.180 --> 10:17.630
this right so if I go here if I say company or ones let's say in different font in a different color.

10:17.980 --> 10:22.330
When press or here right and I can have my custom colors over here right.

10:22.540 --> 10:25.280
So let's say over here 1 9 1 9 1 9.

10:25.610 --> 10:29.350
So when I say select and you can see that I change the color basically.

10:29.420 --> 10:36.800
So once you're done with working with this logo you say Well here it's actually starting to save the

10:36.800 --> 10:39.470
moment it's going to save it's going to offer you an option.

10:39.470 --> 10:39.710
Right.

10:39.710 --> 10:44.690
So we have free one high resolution for turning and then 129.

10:44.810 --> 10:48.200
Once you click download you'll see or hear the free one.

10:48.350 --> 10:50.550
You need to enter first name address.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.580
They'll send you a link.

10:51.590 --> 10:56.780
You go back over here and you download automatically the logo and they're not going to charge you for

10:56.780 --> 10:59.100
anything at least they haven't been charging me.

10:59.550 --> 11:01.110
And you can get it right away.

11:01.130 --> 11:03.540
A very nice good looking logo.

11:03.740 --> 11:08.270
So once you're done with this we're done actually with our set up and we can start working on her app.
