WEBVTT

00:00.560 --> 00:05.400
And the next section you're going to be building is going to be recent posts section and so here this

00:05.400 --> 00:06.670
is going to be very simple.

00:06.680 --> 00:07.160
All right.

00:07.290 --> 00:13.230
We're just going to have a in effect right that a font or some search icon shows up right.

00:13.440 --> 00:18.450
And those are going to set up these like cards right or here you can see this is going to be text and

00:18.450 --> 00:18.950
the button.

00:18.950 --> 00:19.500
All right.

00:19.560 --> 00:24.800
So we're going to go back over here again and we're going to go to the next page the amount and again

00:24.810 --> 00:27.150
we're going to go all the way somewhere at the bottom.

00:27.150 --> 00:29.070
So this was the end of the filler section.

00:29.070 --> 00:29.710
Right.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.970
And this is going to be a posts.

00:32.340 --> 00:37.250
So we're all going to say the comment posts section more here.

00:37.290 --> 00:43.700
And I was going to copy and paste this and I'm going to say this is going to be the end of post section.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.100
Right.

00:44.250 --> 00:50.300
So we scroll all the way over here and we're going to say this is going to be section more here title

00:52.170 --> 00:57.610
and we're going to say well sorry this is going to be ideal posts or you don't like this.

00:57.780 --> 00:59.810
And what we're going to say is this is going to be title.

00:59.820 --> 01:00.410
Right.

01:00.420 --> 01:03.980
So let's go ahead and again grab the title where it is.

01:04.300 --> 01:05.310
Let's find this right.

01:05.340 --> 01:09.340
So title and this is going to be a recent post.

01:09.650 --> 01:13.840
So I was going to copy this guy drag it all the way down here.

01:13.890 --> 01:14.970
Copy this one.

01:15.170 --> 01:23.320
We're going to say this is going to be recent posts or you know in this recent posts.

01:23.340 --> 01:24.420
Right.

01:24.480 --> 01:28.370
So now that we have this we will have a post container.

01:28.450 --> 01:29.030
Right.

01:29.340 --> 01:34.830
So here I'm just going to say this is going to be live post container right.

01:35.150 --> 01:37.710
And we're here we're going to have a post-Iowa right.

01:37.770 --> 01:44.430
So here we're going to create a comment on the post and this is going to be the end of the post right

01:44.820 --> 01:47.030
here and of post.

01:47.050 --> 01:52.590
All right so now that we have this we actually would want a post.

01:52.610 --> 01:58.930
I had them right when I hear someone say this is going to be our goal with a class of post.

01:59.240 --> 02:05.340
I had them right now once we have the actual article we're actually going to have one more comment we're

02:05.340 --> 02:07.660
going to say this is going to be actual card.

02:07.870 --> 02:12.090
Right so we're here we're going to write card here we're going to say this and we did with the class

02:12.090 --> 02:15.840
of image container.

02:15.840 --> 02:19.040
So this is going to hold everything right here within this day.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.070
We're going to place the image.

02:21.420 --> 02:24.430
And this is going to be image from again from current projects right.

02:24.440 --> 02:29.970
So just tab and we're going to see images current project and again in the beginning they are all going

02:29.970 --> 02:30.610
to be massive.

02:30.620 --> 02:33.600
But we already know by now how to actually fix them right.

02:33.600 --> 02:36.850
So image and this is going to be project one.

02:37.050 --> 02:41.130
And then within this image container we're going to add something more we're going to say this is going

02:41.130 --> 02:47.420
to be a link right here with the dummy link HFM here like this.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.190
This is going to be.

02:49.700 --> 02:55.820
Hey hey and search it so search back on the wall here press tab.

02:55.890 --> 03:01.230
Now we're done with the container All right now over here what we're going to have a actual text.

03:01.400 --> 03:01.940
Right.

03:01.980 --> 03:03.450
So this is going to be the second thing.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.930
So this is going what's going to be underneath the picture.

03:06.180 --> 03:11.570
All right so this is going to be text container like this.

03:11.670 --> 03:14.110
We're going to say this is going to be hitting one.

03:14.130 --> 03:21.670
And this is going to be angular post or here and we're going to press tab once we have a heading one

03:21.670 --> 03:24.010
then we're going to have a paragraph.

03:24.060 --> 03:28.980
So obviously we're going right over here and this is going to be paragraph and let's say this is Lorem

03:28.980 --> 03:33.210
15 and let's say all the way back.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.830
This is going to be padding right.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.790
And then we're going to have a leg.

03:36.830 --> 03:40.840
All right so I'm going to say over here we're going to say read more.

03:40.850 --> 03:41.390
Right.

03:41.460 --> 03:44.850
So we're going to have a rough read more.

03:44.950 --> 03:47.590
Right now that we have this.

03:47.790 --> 03:52.220
We're actually ready to move one and add some more of them right.

03:52.230 --> 03:54.980
So what is the post item or here.

03:55.020 --> 04:00.010
I mean we need we need what we need actually to do more.

04:00.010 --> 04:00.270
Right.

04:00.270 --> 04:02.220
So we need to be thorough.

04:02.550 --> 04:08.670
So what I'm going to say is over here we grabbed this and said I want to write and here this is going

04:08.670 --> 04:12.800
to change obviously image and then I will say text should be different too.

04:12.810 --> 04:13.310
Right.

04:13.530 --> 04:16.800
So this one the first one was angler post.

04:16.820 --> 04:18.580
So these guys number two.

04:18.570 --> 04:20.930
This is going to be reac post.

04:21.780 --> 04:24.430
I'm not going to be changing orientalis obviously this text.

04:24.460 --> 04:26.600
I mean this is going to stay the same.

04:26.690 --> 04:31.970
I don't hear it's going to be Javascript Post Script post.

04:32.150 --> 04:32.660
Right.

04:32.910 --> 04:40.050

04:40.050 --> 04:43.250
