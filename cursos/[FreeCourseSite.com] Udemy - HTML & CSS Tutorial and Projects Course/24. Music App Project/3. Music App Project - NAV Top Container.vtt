WEBVTT

00:00.070 --> 00:06.150
And once you are done with the set up start and actually building up and the first thing they're all

00:06.180 --> 00:11.700
going to build is or here this section and we're going to build more here now.

00:12.150 --> 00:16.150
Container here these are going to be the lengths that we're building over here.

00:16.200 --> 00:16.890
Right.

00:16.930 --> 00:18.400
And on this list.

00:18.410 --> 00:20.410
So this is what we're going to build right away.

00:20.790 --> 00:27.910
So we're going to go here and I'm going to get rid of this one and found some.

00:28.050 --> 00:30.560
We don't need them all here.

00:30.630 --> 00:35.690
And we're also going to just refresh because we have all here the body.

00:35.700 --> 00:36.410
Right.

00:36.450 --> 00:39.220
And we're going to go in the body and we're going to start writing.

00:39.740 --> 00:43.500
And the first thing that we would want to do is we're going to say we're here and this is going to be

00:43.530 --> 00:50.700
the half here and now was going to have an idea of an hour of class is going to be signed now.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.980
So here classes is going to be signed here.

00:55.220 --> 01:04.490
Press time and once inside have all gone right and this is going to be Dave with a class of Logo container.

01:04.760 --> 01:08.790
So go Container container over here.

01:09.100 --> 01:19.170
Then inside this logo container we're going to have a div of side logo press time.

01:19.170 --> 01:26.010
Once we get around inside the side logo we would want Image and the source for damage is going to be

01:26.010 --> 01:28.790
images and we're going to go with Logo.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.850
All right so this is going to be our logo.

01:32.100 --> 01:34.200
And then with alternative we can just write.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.980
And this is going to be a logo like this.

01:37.980 --> 01:45.090
And once we're done with the site logo still within a logo container we're actually going to create

01:45.180 --> 01:46.360
a button.

01:46.510 --> 01:47.120
Right.

01:47.190 --> 01:52.500
So we're going to say we're here and this is going to be a side button.

01:53.100 --> 01:59.520
And then with the side button we're going to have a $3 bar one or two on bar three.

01:59.520 --> 02:03.950
So here I can just copy and paste this line one two three.

02:04.220 --> 02:04.750
All right.

02:04.770 --> 02:06.380
This is going to be bar to you.

02:06.690 --> 02:08.440
And this is going to be Barthrop.

02:08.770 --> 02:13.660
Now once we're done we're here with this side button.

02:14.010 --> 02:19.560
And once we're done with a side logo we're actually done with a logo container.

02:19.860 --> 02:26.850
So what we can do here is we're going to say this is going to be logo container yet just so we're actually

02:27.810 --> 02:32.910
not placing everything together and then we're trying to find where are the links and where is the logo

02:32.910 --> 02:33.730
container.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.730
So I'm going to say here we'll go container.

02:36.880 --> 02:41.820
And so once we have this separate Now I can see that we build pretty much in this section.

02:41.890 --> 02:42.140
Right.

02:42.150 --> 02:44.570
We obviously didn't have any success.

02:44.580 --> 02:49.770
Now we want to focus on the links so we're going to go here and we're going to say that this is going

02:49.770 --> 02:51.550
to be on our list.

02:51.650 --> 02:57.300
I'm going to say side have I I'm going to say links right first time.

02:57.430 --> 03:02.280
I know we're going to first say that this is going to be a list item and the list items are going to

03:02.280 --> 03:04.830
say music like this.

03:04.860 --> 03:07.190
Then once we have first started.

03:07.500 --> 03:13.030
Now we would want to have or hear some list items with a likes.

03:13.040 --> 03:13.490
All right.

03:13.710 --> 03:18.570
So we're going to say on here like this and this is going to be a list item here within the last line

03:18.570 --> 03:22.290
and we're going to have or hear a link.

03:22.290 --> 03:24.360
And this is going to be dummy link.

03:24.520 --> 03:29.080
Then within the link We're going to say that this is going to be spanne here.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.710
And in this plan we're actually going to place are fantastic.

03:32.880 --> 03:38.160
All right so here we're going to say f a s and or here we're going to say F.A. since we're going to

03:38.160 --> 03:39.190
be adding more of them.

03:39.230 --> 03:39.710
Right.

03:39.990 --> 03:46.380
And then once outside the span or here right we're actually going to write that this is going to be

03:46.390 --> 03:49.010
let's say featured on this.

03:49.030 --> 03:50.910
All right so this is what we would want.

03:50.910 --> 03:54.990
So what I'm going to do here is we will have a seven of them.

03:54.990 --> 03:57.340
So what I can do here I can just copy and paste them.

03:57.350 --> 03:57.930
All right.

03:57.930 --> 04:02.310
So first what I'm going to do is I'm going to make this a little bit better.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.160
All right so we can see a little bit better.

04:04.530 --> 04:07.250
And we're going to have to put copy and paste this six times.

04:07.260 --> 04:10.090
So one two three four five six.

04:10.110 --> 04:10.670
Right.

04:10.740 --> 04:12.850
So now it's seven.

04:12.870 --> 04:18.150
So what I'm going to say here is I would want to select the whole thing and I'm just going to use a

04:18.200 --> 04:20.790
beauty for this right.

04:20.820 --> 04:23.000
So now we can see better what we're doing.

04:23.160 --> 04:27.120
And the first icon that we're going to have is music.

04:27.490 --> 04:32.520
Then out here we're going to have a microphone on here.

04:32.580 --> 04:40.900
Then the next one is going to be placed and then after that we're going to have a desktop handling this

04:40.990 --> 04:46.640
desk top you can see that it step over here and actually read this.

04:46.660 --> 04:53.070
Then after that dust up are you going to have a heart art here.

04:53.280 --> 05:02.010
And then we have a download here and then after that we have clay and we're actually done with this

05:02.010 --> 05:03.900
part of HDMI.

05:03.930 --> 05:09.960
So now we would need to do is go ahead and actually work with a C Ss.

05:09.980 --> 05:16.380
So here in the sense like always the first thing that we're going to say is that for all the elements

05:16.380 --> 05:20.100
we're going to get rid of a default paddings and margins right.

05:20.280 --> 05:25.200
And we're going to actually set the whole thing for box sizing borderer books.

05:25.290 --> 05:37.560
So you know we're going to sell this right so it brings you know margin 0 0 here and box sizing here

05:38.000 --> 05:45.660
sizing is going to be border box like this once we have this now for the whole body.

05:45.960 --> 05:52.510
Right away in background and I'm going to say the background is going to be hashtag and 5 3 5.

05:52.610 --> 05:53.100
That's right.

05:53.100 --> 05:55.710
So this is going to be light gray background.

05:56.070 --> 06:00.810
Then the next thing that I would want to do is start actually working on here with this logo container.

06:00.990 --> 06:05.920
So I'm going to say logo container right over here where I'm going to save.

06:05.940 --> 06:10.100
Padding is going to be top zero over here.

06:10.980 --> 06:18.000
Write it's going to be 20 pixels like this and then we have 0 0 and this pretty much means that once

06:18.030 --> 06:23.370
we're going to have a button that is going to have a little bit of padding here right away you going

06:23.370 --> 06:24.850
to say this play flex.

06:25.110 --> 06:31.800
Now maybe before we actually work with a display flex Let's actually create the button because otherwise

06:31.800 --> 06:33.910
we are not going to be able to see the button.

06:33.960 --> 06:40.350
So the way we actually make the side button seem all right we're going to say we're here bar and we're

06:40.350 --> 06:42.540
going to say karma bar too.

06:43.170 --> 06:49.940
And this is going to be another comma here and this is going to be bar three like this right.

06:50.060 --> 06:55.960
And we're going to say with is going to be 30 pixels like this then or here.

06:55.980 --> 07:04.320
The height is going to be four pixels like this will have a margin and six pixels are going to be top

07:04.320 --> 07:06.520
bottom five because those are going to be so.

07:06.820 --> 07:12.110
And then we're going to have a background and the background is going to be hashed out go here to serve

07:12.140 --> 07:13.540
and to 6:53.

07:13.670 --> 07:14.270
Right.

07:14.280 --> 07:20.270
So this is going to be our site now that we have all here are so modern.

07:20.360 --> 07:23.910
Now let's go ahead and let's actually work with this container.

07:23.910 --> 07:24.600
Let's continue.

07:24.600 --> 07:25.440
All right.

07:25.440 --> 07:32.330
So here we're going to say is that this is going to be a display and we're going to set it display and

07:32.330 --> 07:34.460
also flex reeling.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.100
That's right.

07:35.290 --> 07:41.280
And I can see that you have displayed them flex had biceps and you're going to say or just if I can't

07:41.280 --> 07:48.350
find space and we're going to say between until we're going to push them as far as from each other as

07:48.350 --> 07:49.420
possible.

07:49.580 --> 07:56.510
And then after that we're going to say a background it's going to be hash tag EF 1 5 0 2 5 like this.

07:56.510 --> 07:56.920
Right.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.350
So this is going to be on here.

07:58.370 --> 08:00.660
This orange background.

08:01.030 --> 08:07.580
And once we have this now let's go ahead and let's actually make this container a little bit smaller.

08:07.800 --> 08:14.250
Or here let's create this container this container image and let's make it a little bit smaller.

08:14.540 --> 08:21.420
So we're going to say here that this is going to be a logo container and we're going to say image and

08:21.620 --> 08:26.090
or here we're going to just say with and with is going to be hundred pixels right.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.170
And I can see that we made it smaller.

08:28.610 --> 08:34.610
So once we have our logo smaller now let's continue working on about end because we just pretty much

08:34.610 --> 08:36.680
created it just so we can see what's happening.

08:36.710 --> 08:37.540
Right.

08:37.590 --> 08:44.330
And then over here I'm going to say we're here and this is going to be side PTEN we're here and we're

08:44.330 --> 08:53.190
going to say align self and we're going to say Center on this then we're going to have a more more we're

08:53.230 --> 08:56.450
here and we're going to say three pixels solid.

08:56.750 --> 09:02.260
And this is going to be hashtag 2 7 7 2 7.

09:02.290 --> 09:03.260
All right.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.670
So now I can see that both of them are exactly the same.

09:06.670 --> 09:08.360
Right exactly in the center.

09:08.840 --> 09:15.140
So now that we're done with this it's actually go ahead and let's add another class.

09:15.220 --> 09:18.460
What this class is going to be you see or hear as I'm pressing.

09:18.710 --> 09:24.070
These bars are actually changing right where we are not going to have the right now to Jacqui right.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.150
Let's first finish the styling right.

09:26.360 --> 09:31.370
However as you can see that once I press the button something is changing with this button and this

09:31.370 --> 09:33.640
something is actually these bars.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.270
And how do we do that.

09:35.390 --> 09:38.280
Here what we need to do is actually had another class.

09:38.360 --> 09:43.930
But we're going to add this class only when we actually say to add a javascript right.

09:43.970 --> 09:45.950
This is not going to be added right away.

09:45.970 --> 09:46.300
Right.

09:46.310 --> 09:48.150
We're only going to see it once we start.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.870
A great engineer and Javascript running right.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.640
So I'm going to say we're here bar one.

09:54.640 --> 09:54.940
All right.

09:54.950 --> 09:59.740
So when this class is and how the bar one is affected.

09:59.830 --> 10:00.460
Right.

10:00.560 --> 10:06.300
And I'm going to say that bar one is actually a fact invent transform and we're going to say take it

10:06.550 --> 10:11.870
here and we can say negative 45 degrees like this.

10:12.050 --> 10:19.160
And then also we're going to say translate and translate we're going to say negative 7 pixels over here

10:19.640 --> 10:23.190
and six pixels and we're going to go over low.

10:23.200 --> 10:29.110
But once the actual class starts running and then I can show you exactly what's happening all right.

10:29.240 --> 10:31.860
But the point is let's create this crack class.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.120
So it actually starts working.

10:34.130 --> 10:37.180
So let's just grab this guy one too.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.890
All right we're going to copy two more times.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.700
No real going to say martu.

10:42.140 --> 10:46.730
And this is going to be bartering or here we're going to write opacity and we're going to say this is

10:46.730 --> 10:50.160
going to be zero you know and that that would be for a second.

10:50.190 --> 10:50.780
All right.

10:50.960 --> 10:53.770
So you were saying before the first bar we had a rotate.

10:53.780 --> 10:55.700
Now we would one translate.

10:55.700 --> 11:02.310
So we're going to see or hear that we would want a opacity we're going to say zero or right.

11:02.480 --> 11:12.590
Then for a third one would want a same thing rotate progun change or here to 45 degrees positive and

11:12.770 --> 11:15.030
negative 8 pixels.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.770
Right so we're going to have negative pixels.

11:17.930 --> 11:22.580
And over here would need to do is we would want this change to happen over time right.

11:22.580 --> 11:27.170
So even though the class is added with javascript it still would take a little bit of time right so

11:27.170 --> 11:30.700
you can see or hear the bars are not changing right away.

11:30.950 --> 11:36.800
So what I'm going to say here that this is going to be a transition basically with the transition we're

11:36.800 --> 11:42.400
saying we would want to change that probably would we would want to happen over time and we have new

11:42.440 --> 11:43.490
ways of writing right.

11:43.490 --> 11:49.680
We can write transform when say writing what would be the properties effect and right.

11:49.820 --> 11:56.660
And what we're saying with all the bars right and with all the bars we would want a transform Trents

11:57.320 --> 11:59.190
form here.

11:59.360 --> 12:07.160
Seconds he's right to what we're saying is that only this property it would take three seconds and it

12:07.160 --> 12:07.320
would.

12:07.340 --> 12:08.250
Easy.

12:08.450 --> 12:14.560
So basically it start slow and then ends right and then after that we're going to say opacity right.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.960
This would be another property right.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.530
This one is for bar two.

12:18.650 --> 12:22.170
And this also is going to be three seconds and we're going to say.

12:22.550 --> 12:25.640
Now there is a shortcut for this right.

12:25.650 --> 12:28.380
What we can do over here is we can write transition.

12:28.630 --> 12:31.690
We could just write all this shortcut.

12:31.830 --> 12:33.760
Let's say three seconds each.

12:33.830 --> 12:39.000
So basically all the properties that we will going to right over here with this change right.

12:39.060 --> 12:40.430
They are going to be affected.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.500
So are here more specifically.

12:42.510 --> 12:44.260
Right over here like this right.

12:44.390 --> 12:45.560
We have many of them right.

12:45.570 --> 12:52.410
We don't need to really bother this and we're going just right all three seconds in or here right now

12:52.410 --> 12:53.850
once we're done with this.

12:54.030 --> 12:59.070
Let's go ahead and maybe let's add a hole here this glass.

12:59.310 --> 13:02.160
So let's go here and let's go to Scripture.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.200
Yes.

13:03.280 --> 13:09.960
And once we were going to be in scramjets now we need to say a few things right now we need to select

13:09.960 --> 13:12.590
something and we need to apply this class.

13:12.660 --> 13:17.830
So here the first thing that I'm going to say is going to be that I would want to select or hear the

13:17.830 --> 13:19.110
side button.

13:19.170 --> 13:20.370
Here is one when.

13:20.470 --> 13:21.930
All right a dollar sign.

13:22.040 --> 13:28.030
And I write parentheses and I right on your side between right so I'm selecting.

13:28.060 --> 13:35.100
So once this side button is clicked right because I'm adding a click comment here what I'm going to

13:35.100 --> 13:41.460
say is this is going to be a function anonymous function and we're going to have a curly braces right.

13:41.520 --> 13:46.240
So basically I'm saying once I look at something should happen and what would be that something.

13:46.240 --> 13:46.710
All right.

13:46.770 --> 13:51.690
So first what I'm going to say is this is going to be another selector and it's all going around on

13:51.710 --> 13:53.000
your side.

13:53.890 --> 14:00.900
Links like this and we need to write side of things basically remember this and our list.

14:01.090 --> 14:07.660
It was it had a class of side of things it's on the right side now links and when we're going to say

14:07.660 --> 14:09.750
is good and we like to go.

14:10.150 --> 14:13.810
So basically I can have a slide up or slide down.

14:13.900 --> 14:20.170
So this wouldn't be a function to do this or if I won have both of them right if I know one just slide

14:20.170 --> 14:22.850
up or slide now I'm going to slide tackle.

14:22.870 --> 14:27.480
So basically the first time I click it is going to slide down and it's going to slide up right.

14:27.520 --> 14:32.160
And here we're going to write it time and again to write three thousand which just stands for 3000 milli

14:32.170 --> 14:34.380
seconds which is actually three seconds.

14:34.450 --> 14:36.000
And the reason why we write it.

14:36.100 --> 14:40.650
Let's say I'm going to write this long because I just want you to see how everything is happening right.

14:40.660 --> 14:47.230
So I would say this and you can save the main She also an on here on the script right.

14:47.260 --> 14:51.470
You can see what happens once I actually press the button.

14:51.570 --> 14:56.030
All right my wings disappear and then they begin to appear.

14:56.050 --> 14:59.250
And so basically this sly dog was working right.

14:59.260 --> 15:01.650
Once we clicked the button something is happening.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.890
Now let's go ahead and let's right away.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.190
What could this change thing.

15:05.260 --> 15:05.890
Right.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.800
So we wouldn't want to have this class.

15:07.810 --> 15:11.860
Now what we want out this class 2 0 1 added to the side button.

15:11.860 --> 15:13.110
So what do we do.

15:13.130 --> 15:18.250
We go back over here going to going back to script tag and the next rule that we're going to say is

15:18.310 --> 15:20.450
right when to say or here like this.

15:20.470 --> 15:23.090
Right then we would want a dollar sign.

15:23.110 --> 15:28.590
Now we actually want to select the actual side by side button.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.440
Well you know I'm going to say tango again.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.850
And now we're going to be tackling the class.

15:34.010 --> 15:34.420
Right.

15:34.540 --> 15:38.280
And the class is going to be you guest and that's going to be change.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.390
Change this.

15:40.570 --> 15:42.030
I say this.

15:42.130 --> 15:45.900
See what happens right now when I press it and disappear.

15:46.240 --> 15:46.690
Right.

15:46.870 --> 15:48.900
And the links are here.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.010
These bars are here.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.600
You see what's happening with them right.

15:51.620 --> 15:53.410
And now let's go over what's happening.

15:53.420 --> 15:53.910
Right.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.920
So here what I'm saying is bar one.

15:55.960 --> 16:03.030
Once the class is that it should rotate down 45 and it does as you can see or here and draw things down.

16:03.220 --> 16:05.420
And also translates on the Web.

16:05.570 --> 16:05.900
Right.

16:05.970 --> 16:12.100
So let's say or here if all right it's like let's say 25 right you can see where the bar is moving right

16:12.100 --> 16:12.340
now.

16:12.340 --> 16:12.760
Right.

16:12.940 --> 16:16.730
So that's why we're writing seven or here or here.

16:16.840 --> 16:20.240
The same thing you can see we're getting rid of this second bar.

16:20.260 --> 16:20.940
Right.

16:20.960 --> 16:26.870
If it's initially there then we are saying ampacity zero on this right so we can see the middle one

16:26.910 --> 16:32.050
disappears and transformed the last one is going to be rotating opposite direction.

16:32.050 --> 16:32.710
Right.

16:32.710 --> 16:34.750
This guy's going to be going up.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.310
I know he can see where it's going.

16:36.370 --> 16:41.830
And again translate again the same thing if we're adding the values we're changing where the bar is

16:41.830 --> 16:43.450
actually flowing right.

16:43.510 --> 16:46.180
So this is what we did here with this button.

16:46.180 --> 16:54.000
Now let's keep on working with our main success and let's actually start the sidewalks when it's all

16:54.020 --> 16:56.750
going to say oh here and we can close this one for now.

16:56.750 --> 16:57.570
All right.

16:58.050 --> 16:59.910
We're going to go back on here.

16:59.980 --> 17:01.070
We're going to start working.

17:01.240 --> 17:08.310
Now we're here maybe let's say a cursor pointer pointer here just so we know that actually has We're

17:08.450 --> 17:09.850
all over the model.

17:09.910 --> 17:16.230
The cursor is going to be pointing then or here let's create more space and we're going to start again

17:16.250 --> 17:17.030
very simple.

17:17.040 --> 17:17.680
All right.

17:17.800 --> 17:26.110
When you say or here side have links right here we're going to say is you know what let's maybe show

17:26.110 --> 17:27.750
them right so we can see what's happening.

17:27.760 --> 17:28.520
Right.

17:28.600 --> 17:34.690
And since we don't have margin batting you don't see these annoying bullet points right but we actually

17:34.690 --> 17:39.560
need to get them right so we're going to say Listowel type and we're going to say not here.

17:39.810 --> 17:46.330
Then the background we're going to say we're here like this hash tag see we were here and then we're

17:46.330 --> 17:48.430
going to have a c 9.

17:48.580 --> 17:51.570
And then we have a C or here again right.

17:51.770 --> 17:53.550
So this is going to be our background.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.860
Then once we have the background.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.830
Now let's start working on them right here.

17:58.840 --> 18:08.420
I'm going to say for the first one side links here and sorry a side have links here and list them.

18:08.510 --> 18:14.290
Now we're going to say first of type and because I want to first select the first type list item you're

18:14.370 --> 18:14.930
right.

18:15.240 --> 18:23.050
Well I'm going to say here that this is going to have a in pairing 10 pixels here then it's going to

18:23.050 --> 18:31.260
have a fun size 20 pixels this than text transform.

18:31.370 --> 18:38.540
We're going to say prickish you know this and font style and we're going to say that this is going to

18:38.540 --> 18:40.560
beat out.

18:41.090 --> 18:44.390
Now let's go ahead and let's start working with these links.

18:44.420 --> 18:44.870
Right.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.750
So we're going to say side.

18:47.070 --> 18:50.580
Now I have two things I'm going to say right.

18:50.750 --> 18:59.180
First of all in this play block you then we're going to have a padding of five pixels and 10 pixels

18:59.180 --> 19:00.120
or here.

19:00.160 --> 19:05.680
All right so platting is going to be top bottom five and 10 pixels or here on the side.

19:05.750 --> 19:14.880
Then we're going to have a fun size 20 pixels on this then text transform is going to be capitalize.

19:14.940 --> 19:18.100
And I thought I was over here text decoration.

19:18.170 --> 19:19.440
It's going to be none.

19:19.440 --> 19:24.740
All right we're going to get rid of this annoying on the line and then we're going to have a color.

19:24.970 --> 19:25.290
Right.

19:25.310 --> 19:27.560
And the color is going to be two.

19:27.690 --> 19:36.630
So when two 6:53 went like this then we're here we're going to write a transition transition here and

19:36.680 --> 19:41.470
that's going to be a background background right.

19:41.710 --> 19:44.800
And we're going to say on here two seconds each.

19:44.830 --> 19:50.950
Now again since what we're going to be doing is there's going to be a few of them we can go right away

19:51.040 --> 19:53.150
and use a shorter range.

19:53.350 --> 19:57.410
We can read the name of them right or we can just use a shortcut.

19:57.580 --> 19:58.640
So I'm going to say here.

19:58.660 --> 20:03.440
All right let's say again three seconds three seconds each.

20:03.630 --> 20:04.250
Why.

20:04.600 --> 20:11.630
Once we have this now the next thing that I would want to do is I want to say what should happen.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.320
Right.

20:12.360 --> 20:22.430
And over here I'm going to say this is going to be side of winks and I'm going to say hover power here.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.460
So I was I'm hovering What should change.

20:25.580 --> 20:27.410
Now I'm going to say background for change.

20:27.480 --> 20:27.760
Right.

20:27.780 --> 20:35.020
And I'm going to use R G B an RDBMS Stickley is the same as R G B is just has over here this value right

20:35.100 --> 20:37.440
where we actually can control the capacity.

20:37.440 --> 20:42.080
So if I'm going to write or here the black color which is 0 0 0 is black.

20:42.090 --> 20:47.550
No I'm saying opacity is going to be zero point five meaning the transparency of this element is going

20:47.550 --> 20:48.640
to be point five.

20:48.870 --> 20:53.230
So if we click over here quicker I think you can see or hear what we have right.

20:53.280 --> 20:56.560
You can see this is my ampacity and this is the actual color.

20:56.940 --> 21:02.510
So obviously with our G.P.A. what I'm where I can do here is I can just change this opacity or here

21:02.520 --> 21:02.910
right.

21:03.090 --> 21:04.520
That's why there's a.

21:04.530 --> 21:05.780
Stands for right.

21:05.880 --> 21:12.720
GBG just stands for red green black and blue right which by values of 0 0 0.

21:12.720 --> 21:13.720
This is going to be black.

21:13.760 --> 21:14.430
Right.

21:14.460 --> 21:16.150
So we're going to have going on back here.

21:16.170 --> 21:16.510
Right.

21:16.530 --> 21:18.740
And what set it to zero point five.

21:18.870 --> 21:20.670
So let's now check it out.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.040
What do we have right.

21:22.070 --> 21:28.500
And you know it looks at the padding let's say padding and let's say padding left and let's say that

21:28.500 --> 21:30.570
this is going to be 30 pixels right.

21:30.660 --> 21:35.250
So you can see that if I have 10 pixels and we're here normal padding right.

21:35.340 --> 21:38.700
What I would want to do as I'm hovering departing should increase.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.180
So let's this region.

21:41.220 --> 21:42.660
You see what I read.

21:42.660 --> 21:44.060
My background is changing.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.950
And so here my padding is change.

21:46.110 --> 21:49.480
However these changes are happening over time.

21:49.700 --> 21:51.680
They do not happen right away.

21:51.790 --> 21:52.140
Right.

21:52.170 --> 21:56.910
It takes them time to Y while the transition takes place.

21:56.910 --> 22:02.550
Right now once we're done with this we're actually able to work on here with this little icon.

22:02.770 --> 22:03.150
Right.

22:03.270 --> 22:09.520
And if we want to work with this little icon we're all going to say side here and have links and we're

22:09.530 --> 22:10.500
going to say span.

22:10.670 --> 22:18.750
And because the span is apparent down here we're going to say font size 20 pixels or healing this then

22:19.020 --> 22:22.040
we're going to say and this is going to be margin right.

22:22.110 --> 22:25.640
And this is going to be 10 pixels like this.

22:25.650 --> 22:29.940
And then we're going to say color we're going to give it this orange color.

22:29.970 --> 22:33.250
We said 1 5 0 5 like this.

22:33.300 --> 22:36.510
Right now we need to have 1 5 0 2 4.

22:36.810 --> 22:42.210
So then we say this over here and we're about to be done.

22:42.240 --> 22:42.780
Right.

22:42.840 --> 22:44.360
But there's one thing that we need.

22:44.430 --> 22:44.850
Right.

22:45.020 --> 22:51.170
So here what you can see that every time I refresh the page right you can see that the links are gone.

22:51.480 --> 22:55.490
Here if I would refresh the links that would always stay or here right.

22:55.500 --> 23:00.900
I don't want to do this because I don't want to break my wife preview right or you know what let's just

23:00.900 --> 23:04.530
do it just so you can see right so you can see they're always over here right.

23:04.560 --> 23:07.680
So every time I refresh the page the links are going to be here.

23:07.810 --> 23:09.570
Now that's not what I would want.

23:09.610 --> 23:15.150
So I'd want initially to have no links or here only when I press the button on here they're all going

23:15.150 --> 23:15.910
up here.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.410
So what are you going to do here for that.

23:18.480 --> 23:23.940
We're going to go back over here and what we would need to say then we would want a site that links

23:24.540 --> 23:27.880
this whole on your list to be displayed.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.770
Now I'm not going to go back over here right.

23:30.780 --> 23:33.040
We could have written them here honestly this right.

23:33.080 --> 23:38.370
We're just so you can see later that it kind of makes sense that we're doing this gradually and right.

23:38.460 --> 23:42.160
We first work on all things and only then we make them display none.

23:42.420 --> 23:46.710
Otherwise if we're going to make them display none and then keep working on a links it's not going to

23:46.710 --> 23:48.030
make much sense right.

23:48.060 --> 23:55.150
So I'm going to say on here side and have your links and when we're going to say we're here in this

23:55.220 --> 23:58.370
plane and so we're going to send this plane on here.

23:58.420 --> 23:58.840
Right.

23:58.880 --> 24:04.450
So now they're actually by default right away gone and only want to press them but no.

24:04.470 --> 24:10.460
Here in the upper right and over here they disappear.

24:10.470 --> 24:12.520
Then again we proceed again in that here.

24:12.580 --> 24:12.990
Right.

24:13.200 --> 24:17.730
So now that we're done with the section we are ready to move one to our next section.
