WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:06.020
And the next section are going to be building is going to be team members section or you are we're here

00:06.020 --> 00:09.040
we're going to use our curso or here like this.

00:09.050 --> 00:09.690
Right.

00:09.840 --> 00:15.950
So what we're going to do here is we're going to go back to the mantle we're going to have.

00:15.990 --> 00:17.510
And of project.

00:17.520 --> 00:20.520
So here we're going to say this is going to be a team.

00:20.780 --> 00:21.420
Right.

00:21.490 --> 00:26.360
And select the line I'm going to say and of theme.

00:26.430 --> 00:34.890
Then once we have the end of team then we're going to have a section section here and then we're going

00:34.890 --> 00:40.920
to say class and you know what let's do it differently let's say that this is going to be a section

00:41.880 --> 00:49.830
with a class of team members here and with the idea of team or you like this.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.220
All right press time.

00:51.480 --> 01:01.710
Then once we have this we're going to create a div here with a class of team center center over here.

01:01.710 --> 01:04.340
Then the class of owl.

01:05.070 --> 01:05.380
Right.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.500
And we're going to explore in the next video why we had English classes.

01:09.510 --> 01:10.080
All right.

01:10.080 --> 01:17.000
So we're going to have an hour or so then we're going to have a Auel theme all theme.

01:17.160 --> 01:23.400
Right so these are the three classes that we need for the right team center out carrousel now.

01:23.790 --> 01:28.920
And then we're going to place eight articles and we're going to start with the first one to say article

01:29.920 --> 01:35.200
we're here and we're going to say class of member press tab here like this.

01:35.200 --> 01:38.900
Then we're going to have a image or here like this.

01:38.900 --> 01:44.220
And for the image we're going to say pretty basic We're going to say we're the source of your image

01:44.730 --> 01:49.020
and we're going to find we're a team and we need team won.

01:49.200 --> 01:58.040
So this is going to be team one then we are going to send member number one in this once we have this

01:58.040 --> 01:58.850
div..

01:59.160 --> 02:06.420
These are the ones we have an article with an image that we would want a div with a member text or like

02:06.420 --> 02:06.650
that.

02:06.650 --> 02:09.570
All right press tab and on here we're going to write it.

02:09.580 --> 02:11.360
This is going to be heading 3.

02:11.470 --> 02:16.920
This is going to be team member team member or press press.

02:17.400 --> 02:24.240
Then we're going to have a heading six like this and we're going to save and this is going to be a web

02:24.960 --> 02:33.240
developer here like this and then we'll have a paragraph right then we're going to have a paragraph

02:33.240 --> 02:37.500
over here and the paragraph is just going to have like let's say 10 words.

02:37.530 --> 02:43.950
All right so we're going to say we're I'm going to say then press time and press another tab or here

02:43.950 --> 02:44.400
like this.

02:44.400 --> 02:44.900
Right.

02:45.120 --> 02:50.700
So this is going to be a team member developer and read a paragraph and then once we have this let's

02:50.820 --> 02:52.590
create the icons.

02:52.670 --> 02:53.180
Right.

02:53.280 --> 02:56.510
So here what I'm going to say this is going to be a div.

02:56.530 --> 02:56.780
Right.

02:56.800 --> 03:02.950
But still still within this article number and still number text.

03:03.120 --> 03:03.440
Right.

03:03.510 --> 03:05.720
Because you can see or hear that.

03:05.790 --> 03:07.670
This is what we're going to deal with right.

03:07.790 --> 03:12.630
So this is going to be a team member here and this is going to be the theme text right.

03:12.630 --> 03:15.080
And the images over here are going to be separate.

03:15.380 --> 03:15.960
All right.

03:16.170 --> 03:23.250
So if we have Article number image and member text over here right once we have this over here we're

03:23.250 --> 03:29.400
going to say this is going to remember we're going to say icons right press tab now we have the icons

03:29.790 --> 03:32.910
and for the icons we're going to say this is going to be a link.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.390
And within the link We're going to have a hash tag.

03:36.390 --> 03:40.620
Then over here we're going to have my be here.

03:40.770 --> 03:46.200
And then we're going to say hey and let's say again we're just going to leave this blank for now because

03:46.200 --> 03:49.880
we're going to copy and paste this subject line one two three.

03:49.880 --> 03:54.630
All right the first one is going to be Twitter here.

03:54.710 --> 04:00.290
Then you have a Facebook Facebook here.

04:00.530 --> 04:08.430
Then you're going to have a Google and then you will have linked in or sorry Instagram Instagram.

04:08.430 --> 04:09.370
All right.

04:09.490 --> 04:15.450
And now what do we need to do is have eight of these articles so we need to copy paste this segment.

04:15.560 --> 04:15.970
Right.

04:16.100 --> 04:25.740
So one two on here and now we have what a total of three and then we need four five six seven eight.

04:25.980 --> 04:27.840
And so now we should have eight of them.

04:28.010 --> 04:32.790
And now what we wanted to do is obviously change where is the images.

04:32.810 --> 04:33.400
Right.

04:33.470 --> 04:36.430
Because everything else is going to stay the same.

04:36.620 --> 04:38.130
So we're going to scroll up.

04:38.210 --> 04:43.250
We're going to start with the first one the one then this is going to be Team Two.

04:43.430 --> 04:52.370
Then after that we're going to have a team three then we'll have a D before then we'll have team.

04:52.540 --> 04:58.760
This is going to be six then we're going to have a seven and then we'll have eight.

04:59.000 --> 04:59.210
Right.

04:59.210 --> 05:02.010
So then you have seven and then you have eight or here.

05:02.030 --> 05:02.920
Right.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.580
So now we have eight of them.

05:04.580 --> 05:06.230
So let's go to Maine.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.600
And let's actually start dialing.

05:09.350 --> 05:16.830
So what we're going to do first is we're going to create a comment on this.

05:16.850 --> 05:23.320
All right we're going to say hashtags and I know we're going to say team members are here like this.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.000
Right.

05:24.290 --> 05:30.320
And I'm going to we're going to have hashtags over here and then we're going to say team members.

05:30.410 --> 05:39.020
So class members knowing this that we're going to say padding and you can see that over here I messed

05:39.020 --> 05:41.250
up that I got rid of or here right.

05:41.270 --> 05:43.700
So now everything is fine.

05:43.730 --> 05:53.120
Team members battings padding or her hundred pixels or here and 20 pixels right so something like this.

05:53.330 --> 06:04.700
Then background let's say that we're going to have a white one hashtag and 5 3 and 3 and 5 on here and

06:04.700 --> 06:11.120
the color and the color we're going to say this is going to be hashtag 1 9 1 9 1 9 or here like this.

06:11.140 --> 06:11.860
Right.

06:12.080 --> 06:16.520
Once we have the color now we would want a member.

06:16.830 --> 06:26.090
Right so we're going to say a member member and we're going to say text align center here and margin

06:26.490 --> 06:28.860
the bottom 40 pixels right.

06:28.880 --> 06:34.930
So once on a smaller screen you can see it will have some margins and then out here zero then we're

06:34.940 --> 06:37.510
going to work with member right image.

06:37.510 --> 06:46.540
So I'm going to say member image here and here we're going to say I like this border and radius right.

06:46.730 --> 06:51.500
And we're going to say like 30 pixels is going to make these round edges or here right.

06:51.920 --> 07:01.600
So once we have the image with around here hijras the same member heading three.

07:01.600 --> 07:01.870
All right.

07:01.880 --> 07:12.430
So this is going to be remember having three text here transform capitalize here and margin 10 pixels

07:12.440 --> 07:15.110
top bottom zero on the sides.

07:15.350 --> 07:20.310
All right then we're going to actually work with a heading 6.

07:20.300 --> 07:31.110
So remember adding six like this and this one is going to be margin 0 0 7 pixels.

07:31.160 --> 07:34.070
I want to hear but I'm zero again.

07:34.310 --> 07:42.650
So this is going to be four and six text transform text transform capitalize like this.

07:42.650 --> 07:44.680
And then we're going to have a color.

07:44.790 --> 07:51.490
Right so we're here we're going to say color are here like this and this is going to be hash tag here.

07:51.540 --> 07:58.360
A 7 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 or here like this right.

07:58.370 --> 08:03.230
Basically we're just going to add some red color over here and now we would want to work with a paragraph

08:03.230 --> 08:05.380
and then start working with icons.

08:05.420 --> 08:13.040
So we're going to say or here this is going to be member we're here paragraph and for this one we would

08:13.040 --> 08:26.930
want a margin first in the bottom so margin 0 0 10 pixels 0 and then line height to less then color

08:28.350 --> 08:37.860
red color and the color is going to be hash tag 9 9 9 9 and a 9 a.

08:38.290 --> 08:41.110
So we're going to make this a great color.

08:41.180 --> 08:41.410
Right.

08:41.420 --> 08:44.030
So it kind of blends out a little bit.

08:44.300 --> 08:50.690
I'm sorry are blends in and here we're going to say that this is going to be mamber icons like this

08:50.800 --> 08:51.360
right.

08:51.440 --> 08:56.590
And for the icons we're going to see this play we're going to say flex right away like this.

08:56.810 --> 09:04.210
And I'm going to say just if I content space around it's all going to evenly spread them out like this

09:04.960 --> 09:10.570
and then we're going to add some paddings right or here we're going to say padding and that's going

09:10.570 --> 09:14.420
to be zero and 30 pixels or here like this.

09:14.730 --> 09:24.010
And now what we would want is a member icons a slogan to say member icons A All right we would want

09:24.010 --> 09:28.880
to select them font size 30 pixels.

09:28.890 --> 09:30.950
Right so now we make them bigger.

09:30.970 --> 09:36.820
And now we each and every one of them we would just want to make change the color right and we would

09:36.820 --> 09:40.840
want to change for the hex colors that actually they relate to.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.520
So if I right over here right.

09:42.880 --> 09:46.340
All right member icons right.

09:46.360 --> 09:55.090
And I write a phrase book on here what I'm going to say that this is going to be color hash tag three

09:55.700 --> 10:02.240
be 5 9 9 8 5 9 9 8.

10:02.470 --> 10:02.950
Right.

10:03.150 --> 10:05.030
So this is going to be the face car.

10:05.310 --> 10:08.140
Then after that once a member.

10:08.550 --> 10:13.080
And we're just going to change these values I'm just going to copy and paste this three times one two

10:13.230 --> 10:14.910
three right or here.

10:15.270 --> 10:21.360
Then we're going to write member icons we're here we're going to write Instagram instead of grandma

10:21.360 --> 10:22.290
over here.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.090
And then we're going to do.

10:24.090 --> 10:32.730
Here is where we're going to write and this is going to be F B three B three then we'll have a 9 5 8

10:34.080 --> 10:36.350
9 5 8 9.

10:36.490 --> 10:43.400
So this is going to be Instagram and then we're going to have four to go right there until he does go

10:43.470 --> 10:46.820
Whoa whoa whoa.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.080
Can delete this one.

10:48.300 --> 10:55.010
So we're going to write F and for C and 2 0.

10:55.010 --> 10:56.200
D.

10:56.240 --> 10:56.700
Right.

10:56.710 --> 10:59.560
So this is going to be yellow from the Google.

10:59.580 --> 11:06.120
Now obviously Google doesn't I don't I haven't seen Google has a color like this meaning it is written

11:06.120 --> 11:08.810
in Google as the yellow color.

11:08.810 --> 11:09.350
Right.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.590
This is what we're using.

11:10.620 --> 11:12.260
But usually you don't see these G.

11:12.330 --> 11:12.600
Right.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.440
So I usually use in different color.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.340
I just wanted to show you that.

11:16.340 --> 11:19.980
Let's see if we can get like a yellow color for example right.

11:20.010 --> 11:30.920
And then last one on here is going to be 0 0 for a Twitter 00 and a c e d.

11:30.960 --> 11:31.340
All right.

11:31.350 --> 11:36.100
So this is going to be a Twitter color and we just need to change it or here to Twitter.

11:36.250 --> 11:43.650
So Twitter or Right now we have the Twitter culture and now the next thing that we need to do is actually

11:44.040 --> 11:48.840
add a so our color so our document.

11:48.840 --> 11:49.050
Right.

11:49.050 --> 11:52.760
Because for now all you can see is basically blocks of images.

11:52.770 --> 11:54.120
And over here with some text.
