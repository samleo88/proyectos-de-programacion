WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:05.580
Now once we have our age email let's set up our sea assess as well.

00:05.580 --> 00:10.110
So like I said skipping that bar for now unknown.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.150
Let's ride away start working on a hero.

00:12.540 --> 00:14.910
So the hero had a class of hero.

00:14.950 --> 00:16.690
That's the reason why we're targeting.

00:16.860 --> 00:17.970
And let's just write.

00:17.990 --> 00:20.810
Mean height to be hundred viewers.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.120
Because if the content within this particular hero element is going to be less than run and view heads

00:27.450 --> 00:32.310
while at the end of the day it's going to be under review Heights which is going to be a hundred percent

00:32.730 --> 00:38.280
of the viewport whether that's a desktop or a mobile screen size.

00:38.670 --> 00:44.820
Now I also said on the extra small screen size and small screen size I would want to have a background

00:45.210 --> 00:51.180
that is just going to be our primary color because I wouldn't want to force our massive image on those

00:51.180 --> 00:52.770
small screen sizes.

00:52.770 --> 00:57.210
Then I also like to right away place the text in the center.

00:57.270 --> 01:03.000
And since we have already covered flex box we know that if I would like to in fact get it in the center

01:03.090 --> 01:08.410
I just need to use a line items as well as justify content for the horizontal center.

01:08.430 --> 01:12.630
So first and foremost let's set this up as this play flex.

01:12.630 --> 01:19.880
So it should be our parent container and then let's place it vertically and horizontal in the center.

01:19.900 --> 01:21.680
So justify content center.

01:21.820 --> 01:24.170
That place is horizontal in the center.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.720
And also I would like to place it vertically in the center.

01:27.790 --> 01:33.540
So let's right on the line items and I would also like to place it in the center right.

01:33.970 --> 01:35.350
That's number one.

01:35.350 --> 01:36.530
Well what else.

01:36.640 --> 01:42.300
Now of course we would want to also start working in fact on our hero title correct.

01:42.310 --> 01:51.640
So let's go for the hero title your own title and then as far as hero title is concerned we're gonna

01:51.660 --> 01:55.600
set up a text transform to be in fact uppercase.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.910
So let's write.

01:56.910 --> 02:03.580
Text transform upper case uppercase.

02:03.850 --> 02:11.530
And then what else we have we have a little bit of margin and bottom margin model is going to be let's

02:11.530 --> 02:14.980
say to our rhythms.

02:15.180 --> 02:19.640
And last but not least we are going to have some letter spacing so we're not gonna use.

02:19.660 --> 02:24.450
In fact our generic one is gonna be a little bit bigger than our variable.

02:24.460 --> 02:26.250
So I'm gonna go with zero point four.

02:26.380 --> 02:32.530
And as you see we're working with hero title and that's the reason why we have right now a little bit

02:32.530 --> 02:37.350
of in fact bigger margin in the bottom as well as the letter spacing.

02:37.360 --> 02:45.610
Now remember before we had a hero title and was responsible for continually exploring we also had the

02:45.610 --> 02:51.780
hero banner and this specifically was used again to place everything in the center.

02:51.790 --> 02:58.840
Now even though it is sitting horizontal in a center there is currently one issue and the simple issue

02:58.840 --> 03:07.340
is that we're going to have to target the hero banner and like so let's use text online also on center

03:07.670 --> 03:13.630
because we would want to center our text as well because even though our device sitting in the center.

03:13.760 --> 03:19.560
Well since we have here the text I would also like to place the text in center.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.700
Then what else we can do.

03:21.710 --> 03:26.020
Well as far as the color I could change the color.

03:26.150 --> 03:31.260
I could set this up as main white for my whole banner like so.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.850
So the whole text is going to be white.

03:33.950 --> 03:37.070
And let's also add a little bit of padding on the sides.

03:37.280 --> 03:41.930
So let's write padding 0 2 harems.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.270
So that gives me this particular pattern.

03:44.360 --> 03:48.810
And again I would like to point out that I have massively zoomed in.

03:48.890 --> 03:52.000
So that's how it is going to look like 100 percent.

03:52.190 --> 03:57.580
But I'm having 175 men right after the hero banner and hero title.

03:57.710 --> 04:05.350
I'm gonna work with hero text that is going to be my paragraph where I'm going to say hero text and

04:05.360 --> 04:12.730
let's go with with 85 percent so the width is going to be a little bit less than I would like to place

04:12.730 --> 04:13.840
it in the center.

04:13.840 --> 04:20.980
So I'm going to go for margin bottom zero and then all that is going to place it exactly in the center

04:20.980 --> 04:21.610
again.

04:21.790 --> 04:28.210
And then let's add a little bit of letter spacing and four letter spacing in this case I am going to

04:28.210 --> 04:35.920
use my main spacing variable so let's say main spacing that has my variable and line height is going

04:35.920 --> 04:37.330
to be in fact.

04:37.330 --> 04:39.490
No you're not we already set this up.

04:39.580 --> 04:46.510
Remember when we work with paragraph we already set this up as to so we can skip right now and then

04:46.510 --> 04:48.400
run after the main spacing.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.430
We're going to go with font weight.

04:50.590 --> 04:53.720
And in this case we're going to go for 400.

04:53.890 --> 05:01.780
So if previously all my paragraphs are gonna be in fact 300 on this case I'm setting this up as 400.

05:01.930 --> 05:05.950
Now we are almost done with our extra small screen size.

05:05.950 --> 05:13.510
However I would love also like to have some styles for my buttons and in this particular case since

05:13.570 --> 05:18.130
I'm going to reuse the button I'm gonna set this up in a global start.

05:18.190 --> 05:23.920
Now you don't have to technically you can set this up on course you can always access the class but

05:24.370 --> 05:31.240
everything that I'm accessing in fact multiple times in my assess I would like to set up in my global

05:31.240 --> 05:34.210
stars because that way it's a little bit easier for me to find it.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.590
Now that is my preference.

05:35.590 --> 05:37.210
You don't have to do it of course.

05:37.330 --> 05:37.960
So let's write.

05:37.960 --> 05:47.320
Button white and then what I would like let's go with text transform case like so then let's also add

05:47.320 --> 05:56.470
right of way some letter spacing letter spacing so main spacing variable then we have a color.

05:56.470 --> 05:58.500
So I'm going to go for the White one.

05:58.780 --> 06:09.470
So var main white like so then let's also add a little bit of border so let's write more and I'm going

06:09.470 --> 06:12.390
to go for two pixels solid.

06:12.630 --> 06:19.320
And again we're gonna go for the main white and that is our color then we are gonna have a little bit

06:19.320 --> 06:19.890
of padding.

06:20.550 --> 06:28.050
So let's go top bottom zero point nine harems one point six left and right and then I would want it

06:28.050 --> 06:37.250
to be display inline block so let's write display inline block because that way we're going to be respecting

06:37.340 --> 06:43.640
the margins there are in fact added to the rest of the elements then also let's add maybe a little bit

06:43.640 --> 06:52.490
of transition let's say transition is going to be I don't know main transition so let's write var main

06:52.550 --> 06:53.720
transition.

06:53.870 --> 06:59.390
So as we're hovering I would like to change the color on as far as the cursor while the cursor is going

06:59.390 --> 07:01.450
to be deep winter.

07:01.820 --> 07:06.170
Then once we have this particular setup what we would want.

07:06.200 --> 07:06.770
Wow.

07:06.770 --> 07:14.210
After that I would like to in fact also set up some hovering where as I'm hovering over the button white

07:14.710 --> 07:17.120
I'm going to change the color as well.

07:17.120 --> 07:27.450
So let's right here beat n Beatty can hover Beatty and white hover sorry Beatty and wide hover and as

07:27.450 --> 07:32.430
we're hovering over it I'm going to change the background and the background is going to be men white

07:33.700 --> 07:40.120
so mane white like so and color is going to be a primary color.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.810
So far primary color like so.

07:44.390 --> 07:45.400
So as we're hovering.

07:45.470 --> 07:48.790
Notice that is in fact our button now.

07:49.280 --> 07:56.210
While we're also going to set up like I said once we get to a bigger screen says I would like to place

07:56.270 --> 07:59.150
in fact there a background image.

07:59.150 --> 08:06.800
So currently what I have is in fact the background of just my color or what I would like to do is as

08:06.800 --> 08:08.460
we get to the bigger screen size.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.930
I would like to have a background image.

08:11.450 --> 08:17.350
Now I'm going to head over back to my hero like so and I'm gonna set up the media query some would a

08:17.370 --> 08:22.460
medium screen and then let's go with men with.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.650
So we just need to come up with.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.580
Well what would be the screen size where we're starting.

08:27.590 --> 08:34.300
In fact our background as the image and I'm going to say 768 pixels.

08:34.310 --> 08:38.440
So starting from 768 In fact we're gonna change it around.

08:38.690 --> 08:42.640
We're hero is going to have a background.

08:42.920 --> 08:47.190
However the background is not going to be just a color.

08:47.270 --> 08:50.420
In fact we're going to set up a image.

08:50.420 --> 08:55.870
Now I am missing and that's the reason why I have in fact the error and now everything should work.

08:56.210 --> 08:57.060
So background.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.990
Let's start by simply placing the.

08:59.990 --> 09:04.490
You are all that is the syntax and then let's pass in our image.

09:04.520 --> 09:10.850
Now we need to understand one thing though that since our style CSX is sitting within the systems folder

09:11.360 --> 09:18.200
in order to access the images Wow we're gonna have to do some navigation where I have to leave in fact

09:18.260 --> 09:25.400
myself as folder and then I'm going to put images online within the images we're shooting for this main

09:25.400 --> 09:28.770
J.P. Morgan since it is our second project.

09:28.910 --> 09:34.490
I really kind of expect that you remember our background properties if you don't.

09:34.490 --> 09:39.920
Again please head over back tutorial where we cover them where I would like to right away place my image

09:39.980 --> 09:43.040
in the center I would make sure that covers everything.

09:43.190 --> 09:46.670
And I'm also gonna go for no repetition.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.080
All right and I'm gonna set this as fixed.

09:49.160 --> 09:53.060
So we're gonna have our parallax effect now in order to test that out.

09:53.060 --> 09:59.450
I'm not going to make this particular screen size bigger but we're gonna head over back to our project

09:59.890 --> 10:03.750
like so and as you can see once we get to the bigger screen size.

10:03.830 --> 10:05.250
Well there you go.

10:05.270 --> 10:11.460
We do have our image where previously we have course had our background color.

10:11.870 --> 10:13.000
That's number one.

10:13.010 --> 10:20.780
Then I would also like to increase my font size once I get the bigger screen size as well as make the

10:20.900 --> 10:23.940
paragraph a little bit less with.

10:24.100 --> 10:27.980
So I'm gonna set it up like let's say 70 percent.

10:27.980 --> 10:37.710
So the way we do that within the media I'm going to set up as a hero title like so why don't we go for

10:37.710 --> 10:38.650
font size.

10:38.760 --> 10:39.890
I don't know.

10:39.900 --> 10:44.850
Four point five rhythms like so as you say.

10:44.850 --> 10:52.290
Now my text is massive and then like I said for the paragraph we already had a width of 80 percent initially

10:52.290 --> 10:53.450
or 85.

10:53.700 --> 11:00.060
Let's go for hero text and I'm gonna set this text as with of 80.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.850
So arms are not 80 70.

11:02.880 --> 11:03.900
So let's set this up.

11:03.940 --> 11:08.570
And now it's sitting nicely within a center with a with of 80.

11:08.850 --> 11:15.710
Then I would also like to place some linear gradient as a background as currently it's hard to see our

11:15.720 --> 11:17.010
white text.

11:17.030 --> 11:25.130
Right now the way we're gonna do that is in fact in front of the URL we're gonna write a linear gradient.

11:25.170 --> 11:29.450
Then let's add comma and we can add whatever colors we'll like.

11:29.760 --> 11:34.380
By default the first color we're gonna add is going to be our top color.

11:34.650 --> 11:39.570
And then the bottom one is going to be our bottom color or I'm sorry the second color is going to be

11:39.570 --> 11:40.950
the bottom color.

11:40.950 --> 11:46.020
Now of course you can change in fact directions as well but I'm going to go with default one where the

11:46.020 --> 11:50.390
top one is going to be RGA 63.

11:51.660 --> 11:53.160
Two hundred eight.

11:53.670 --> 11:56.800
And lastly two hundred twelve.

11:56.970 --> 12:00.830
And then it's going to have the capacity of zero point seven.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.110
That's my first color.

12:02.130 --> 12:07.710
Make sure that you have the common between linear gradient and the URL as well as between the first

12:07.710 --> 12:09.080
color and the second color.

12:09.450 --> 12:17.190
And let's write our GPA that is of course my value and then let's write zero zero zero point seven.

12:17.820 --> 12:23.180
So my bottom color is going to be black with opacity of zero point seven OK.

12:23.620 --> 12:24.730
And there you go.

12:24.750 --> 12:29.970
We have right now our linear gradient as well as the background image.

12:29.970 --> 12:38.610
Now as far as flags box is concerned what we used while we had our properties for display of flux correct

12:38.870 --> 12:40.140
and that was display flex.

12:40.140 --> 12:46.630
So now our hero component or hero element is in fact display flex.

12:46.680 --> 12:54.530
And then once we have that particular setup we also have in fact the case where I'm using justified

12:54.530 --> 13:02.840
content so I'm gonna be placing right now the div Exactly exactly in the center correct.

13:02.850 --> 13:06.290
And then I also place it horizontal in the center.

13:06.300 --> 13:13.620
Now since we have all our text wrapped already within div we do need to set up a text line center.

13:13.620 --> 13:19.380
Now lastly I'm noticing one thing that even though I went with margin zero so top bottom 0 and left

13:19.380 --> 13:26.130
and right or for my paragraph to place it in the center you know what I'm also gonna add some margin

13:26.130 --> 13:27.380
just for the bottom.

13:27.420 --> 13:32.070
Now I could write all these four values here but I think it's just going to be easier I'm going to go

13:32.070 --> 13:38.730
with margin bottom to our OEM's for my paragraph and then once we're done with setting up everything

13:38.730 --> 13:39.660
with flux.

13:39.660 --> 13:42.540
So that is as far as flex box is concerned.

13:42.540 --> 13:44.210
Well then we used our background.

13:44.490 --> 13:48.900
So once we get the bigger screen size then in fact we're getting our image.

13:48.930 --> 13:55.160
So we're using your URL then we placed it in the center and make sure it covers there's no repetition.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.000
It is fixed.

13:56.310 --> 14:02.330
So in fact as we're going to start scrolling you'll notice that it is going to be a parallax effect.

14:02.520 --> 14:09.720
And then of course we just increase the size for my hero title as well as make that text a little bit

14:09.720 --> 14:14.210
less in a width so it sits a little bit more nicely in the center.

14:14.280 --> 14:20.310
And once we're done with a hero element now we're ready to move on to our about section.
