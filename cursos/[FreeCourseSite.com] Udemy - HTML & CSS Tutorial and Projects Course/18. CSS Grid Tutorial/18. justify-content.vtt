As we were working with CSX grid in fact there are some properties that we could borrow from CSX flex

00:06.990 --> 00:13.160
bucks on and following few videos we explore these particular properties.

00:13.170 --> 00:17.070
The first one we're going to look at is going to be justify count.

00:17.580 --> 00:23.100
So first and foremost what I would like to do is change around my columns again and I'm going to go

00:23.090 --> 00:24.480
400 pixels.

00:24.570 --> 00:29.970
But why don't we use the repeat function that we just learn so let's ride repeat.

00:30.180 --> 00:34.360
And then we're gonna go for let's say three of them on line.

00:34.360 --> 00:39.280
The width is going to be let's say hundred pixels something like that.

00:39.510 --> 00:42.970
Then I'm gonna get her off the template rows for now.

00:43.110 --> 00:47.380
And I'm also gonna add some kind of height to my particular container.

00:47.640 --> 00:50.630
So it's a right mean height.

00:50.650 --> 00:54.960
And let's go with let's say hundred percent of the viewport.

00:55.320 --> 00:59.820
Now I'm going to zoom in back here and now we're ready to go.

00:59.820 --> 01:07.140
So like I said justify content now what just define content is doing is in fact it is working with our

01:07.140 --> 01:13.070
content that we have within our great container just like we had when we were using flex box.

01:13.140 --> 01:19.050
So let's say I could say just content and by default it's going to be flex start as the reason why when

01:19.050 --> 01:21.980
I said it flex start well nothing changes.

01:22.500 --> 01:27.990
Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna copy and paste it and I'm gonna come out of this line just for your

01:27.990 --> 01:36.180
reference like so and then let's change this to a flex end and what is going to happen all our content

01:36.450 --> 01:38.640
all the rows and columns that we're gonna have.

01:39.030 --> 01:43.080
Well it's gonna shift on left hand side regardless of the screen size.

01:43.110 --> 01:48.480
So notice of course right now I have a bigger screen size and still the same thing all my content has

01:48.480 --> 01:51.140
been shifted all the way to the left hand side.

01:51.180 --> 01:57.340
Now we're obviously not limited to flex and so again we're just copying pasting that.

01:57.540 --> 02:04.800
And then what we would like to do here is in fact set up a different value so not flex and I'm sorry

02:04.800 --> 02:07.200
I wanted to actually common this out.

02:07.200 --> 02:11.910
So let me comment out and let's write center something like that.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.060
And now my content is sitting in a center.

02:14.550 --> 02:21.450
And then we have three more space between space around and spaced evenly so I can just copy it.

02:21.450 --> 02:26.900
Let's a three more times and then let's just keep on writing.

02:27.150 --> 02:36.750
So I'm gonna start with let's say space evenly space evenly so I'm along when I have a even space in

02:36.750 --> 02:38.020
between my atoms.

02:38.250 --> 02:46.680
Then of course we also have this guy we have a space around so why don't we do this when we move this

02:46.680 --> 02:56.400
one up then comment out then let's write space between now what's going to happen is that left column

02:56.730 --> 03:02.370
and the right column are gonna be flush with the edges of my container and then I'm gonna have the even

03:02.370 --> 03:03.650
space in between.

03:03.660 --> 03:09.780
Of course in vivo I'm going to add one more item let's say four columns then I'm gonna have the same

03:09.780 --> 03:14.090
layout in this case though I'm going to have the extra item in between here.

03:14.090 --> 03:20.070
Right but the left column is gonna still stay all the way on the left hand side and the same is going

03:20.070 --> 03:25.890
to be with a right com just like we had when we were using flex box yeah.

03:25.980 --> 03:28.360
Now let me move this up again.

03:28.750 --> 03:32.810
Like so the last one we have a space around.

03:33.060 --> 03:34.670
So why don't we delete this one.

03:34.710 --> 03:42.120
I copy and paste it one too many times and let's just write space around right now in this case we're

03:42.120 --> 03:49.440
gonna have some distance in between the edges but then again we're gonna have also the margins in between.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.720
All right Ms within the.

03:50.830 --> 03:51.980
Yes that's good.

03:52.030 --> 03:58.920
Now lastly I would like to point it out though that it matters of what is the width of your column when

03:58.920 --> 04:06.210
you are using justified content because of me show the example let's say we're going to go with hundred

04:06.210 --> 04:13.620
pixels on it pixels and one of them and even one of them I could just go with one fraction Now notice

04:13.650 --> 04:20.040
what happens I can have whatever values I would like but since I have here the one fraction Well it

04:20.040 --> 04:26.130
doesn't really matter anymore does it as one fraction is going to take up the rest of the space so I

04:26.130 --> 04:32.190
can set up whatever values I would like here I could just let's say flex and and what you'll notice

04:32.190 --> 04:38.180
that nothing is going to change because even one fraction is pretty much gonna change everything around

04:38.220 --> 04:43.500
so it matters of what kind of values you have for the columns let's say if you have two hundred pixels

04:43.500 --> 04:51.150
yes it has an absolute value so we can still use it but if you're gonna use a fraction values well whatever

04:51.150 --> 04:57.030
you have values here forty justified on the property nothing is gonna change in your layout.
