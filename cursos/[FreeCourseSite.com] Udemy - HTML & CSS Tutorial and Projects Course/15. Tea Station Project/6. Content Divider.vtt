00:00.810 --> 00:06.960
Our next section if we can even call it that is going to be this little linear gradient which is gonna

00:06.990 --> 00:08.670
work as our divider.

00:08.670 --> 00:11.610
So that should not take us more than five minutes.

00:11.640 --> 00:15.050
And we're gonna head over back to indexation email right after the header.

00:15.090 --> 00:21.810
We will gonna set up a new comments again and we're going to call this not the divider but let's say

00:21.810 --> 00:24.500
content divider.

00:24.540 --> 00:29.520
Hopefully this is how you spell divider as well as you know what we're going to write away set it up

00:29.710 --> 00:31.320
set up a second one.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.700
So I was gonna say something like this.

00:32.700 --> 00:39.120
So end of content divider technically maybe in this case this is a little bit of overkill but since

00:39.120 --> 00:42.270
we are doing this for all these sections why does.

00:42.270 --> 00:44.670
Might as well we just stay consistent.

00:44.670 --> 00:50.090
And here we're going to write div with a class of content divider.

00:50.170 --> 00:50.570
Yeah.

00:50.610 --> 00:54.360
Now this is gonna be our divider obviously at the moment nothing is happening.

00:54.360 --> 01:02.760
We need to do all our job within the style us and you're all gonna again add a linear gradient I will

01:02.760 --> 01:07.290
gonna look for end of animations and then let's write here content.

01:07.680 --> 01:14.840
The writer can we're gonna copy and paste it and send off content divider and we're gonna say that we

01:14.840 --> 01:19.070
are selecting the class since I was like this was the class name that we gave.

01:19.230 --> 01:21.210
And then here we're gonna say first all height.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.530
So I want some kind of height.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.230
And in this case this is going to be zero point five.

01:25.230 --> 01:29.760
And we know that we can use the background property for the background property we have an optional

01:29.760 --> 01:35.040
of lending gradient and we know that we have multiple options of how this gradient is gonna be set up

01:35.460 --> 01:36.330
originally.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.790
It comes from the top to the bottom.

01:38.970 --> 01:44.580
But if we're using the same colour we know that we can get one colour overlay how or why don't we use

01:44.580 --> 01:45.940
these to the left one.

01:46.320 --> 01:52.440
So this is gonna be going to the left and here instead of adding one colour or two colours why don't

01:52.440 --> 01:56.340
we add three and the colors are gonna be very very simple.

01:56.340 --> 02:00.010
Well what is gonna work with the primary colour and this can vary colour.

02:00.150 --> 02:01.170
And this is what I said.

02:01.170 --> 02:07.710
The secondary colour actually we're just gonna use it one time so you might as well maybe you could

02:07.710 --> 02:13.970
have skipped this has a variable but again just to stay consistent why don't we add them and the colours.

02:13.980 --> 02:15.320
How did we select them.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.350
We had an option.

02:16.350 --> 02:22.170
And again I can look for the colour in my case I'm gonna be looking first for the primary colour and

02:22.170 --> 02:24.610
this is where it might throw you in there.

02:24.660 --> 02:30.540
So you need to change it a little bit and say that now you're going to be looking for this variable

02:31.020 --> 02:36.150
and in our case what would be the variable the primary colour then we're going to have the come again

02:36.210 --> 02:43.040
then the second one is gonna be secondary and last comma and again and we're gonna be looking for the

02:43.040 --> 02:46.510
primary so far primary colour.

02:46.550 --> 02:48.320
Now we should have a nice divider.

02:48.560 --> 02:55.160
I'm just gonna use it here within the section between the header and whatever we're having I guess the

02:55.160 --> 02:57.940
next one was the skills so I'm gonna use it here.

02:57.950 --> 03:00.530
But you're going to use it all throughout the document.

03:00.590 --> 03:02.110
It's really up to you.

03:02.180 --> 03:06.140
Yeah we're done with this section and we can move on and start working on our next section.
