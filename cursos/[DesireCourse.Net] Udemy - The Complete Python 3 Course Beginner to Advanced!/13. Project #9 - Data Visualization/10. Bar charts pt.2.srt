1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,879
Alright, so, what I'm going to do now is

2

00:00:02,879  -->  00:00:04,920
I'm going to start adding our multiple

3

00:00:04,920  -->  00:00:07,890
data sets to this bar chart, and we're very

4

00:00:07,890  -->  00:00:10,950
quickly going to see one problem

5

00:00:10,950  -->  00:00:12,900
that we're going to need to account for.

6

00:00:12,900  -->  00:00:16,049
So let's go ahead and create c1 which is

7

00:00:16,049  -->  00:00:18,630
going to be Canada's data, and we're going to

8

00:00:18,630  -->  00:00:21,510
say plt.bar and here we're going to pass

9

00:00:21,510  -->  00:00:25,019
in our data. So the x-axis is going to be

10

00:00:25,019  -->  00:00:27,840
the index variable there, which essentially

11

00:00:27,840  -->  00:00:32,160
it's a list that says 0, 1, 2, and we're

12

00:00:32,160  -->  00:00:35,670
going to add Canada scores, and then

13

00:00:35,670  -->  00:00:37,290
we're going to set the bar width also

14

00:00:37,290  -->  00:00:42,239
to .5. Now when I run this you're going to

15

00:00:42,239  -->  00:00:46,620
see that the bars themselves are

16

00:00:46,620  -->  00:00:51,210
occupying the same space, except

17

00:00:51,210  -->  00:00:52,829
vertically because the vertical values

18

00:00:52,829  -->  00:00:54,750
are different, but essentially when

19

00:00:54,750  -->  00:00:57,629
setting the index here to 0, 1, and 2

20

00:00:57,629  -->  00:01:00,899
we're setting the x axis or the

21

00:01:00,899  -->  00:01:04,019
horizontal position to the same values,

22

00:01:04,019  -->  00:01:05,549
and so they're going to occupy the same

23

00:01:05,549  -->  00:01:07,530
space. So what we could do we definitely

24

00:01:07,530  -->  00:01:11,820
could modify this maybe to make that

25

00:01:11,820  -->  00:01:14,220
chart or to make those bars with it

26

00:01:14,220  -->  00:01:16,140
thinner, and that way we could compare

27

00:01:16,140  -->  00:01:19,950
the data. Actually, we do it the opposite

28

00:01:19,950  -->  00:01:22,740
way there. Let's make Canada's, because Canada's

29

00:01:22,740  -->  00:01:25,290
are on top so we could compare it like

30

00:01:25,290  -->  00:01:26,700
that, but that just doesn't look right,

31

00:01:26,700  -->  00:01:29,400
and we're going to be adding two more to

32

00:01:29,400  -->  00:01:33,810
it. So what we need to do I'm going to

33

00:01:33,810  -->  00:01:39,210
create a bar width here, and we're just

34

00:01:39,210  -->  00:01:41,820
going to set it to .1 actually so

35

00:01:41,820  -->  00:01:42,810
they're actually going to be a lot

36

00:01:42,810  -->  00:01:46,350
smaller, and then we're going to use the

37

00:01:46,350  -->  00:01:49,229
bar width variable here because we're

38

00:01:49,229  -->  00:01:52,229
also going to be using this variable for

39

00:01:52,229  -->  00:01:55,049
another calculation. So, if I go ahead and

40

00:01:55,049  -->  00:01:56,939
restart the application you're going to

41

00:01:56,939  -->  00:01:57,899
see they're thinner, but they're

42

00:01:57,899  -->  00:02:00,509
occupying the same space, so what I can

43

00:02:00,509  -->  00:02:07,740
do is this right here is from 0 to 0.1

44

00:02:07,740  -->  00:02:14,000
or 0.5 because each bar width is

45

00:02:14,000  -->  00:02:20,540
.1, so I can set the next bar or

46

00:02:20,540  -->  00:02:24,170
Canada's bar instead of having a

47

00:02:24,170  -->  00:02:30,350
starting point of 0, 1, and 2 I can

48

00:02:30,350  -->  00:02:34,940
set that to 0.1, 1.1, and 2.1. So

49

00:02:34,940  -->  00:02:36,590
how I'm going to do that is just in the

50

00:02:36,590  -->  00:02:38,600
index which actually plots out the

51

00:02:38,600  -->  00:02:41,840
x-axis I'm going to do a bit of math

52

00:02:41,840  -->  00:02:45,530
here, and I'm going to basically just

53

00:02:45,530  -->  00:02:51,980
index plus bar_width, and this should place

54

00:02:51,980  -->  00:02:55,880
it in the orange one just to the right of

55

00:02:55,880  -->  00:02:58,700
the blue ones, and as you can see that's

56

00:02:58,700  -->  00:03:01,730
the exact desired result. So what I'm

57

00:03:01,730  -->  00:03:03,470
going to do now is I'm going to add

58

00:03:03,470  -->  00:03:06,440
China and France's score, and I'm also

59

00:03:06,440  -->  00:03:09,890
going to apply this same method except

60

00:03:09,890  -->  00:03:13,130
it's going to be bar_width x 2, and

61

00:03:13,130  -->  00:03:15,320
bar_width x 3, for example. Or, we could also

62

00:03:15,320  -->  00:03:18,590
simplify that into a different math

63

00:03:18,590  -->  00:03:21,470
equation, but for right now let's go

64

00:03:21,470  -->  00:03:25,130
ahead and create ch1, it's going to be

65

00:03:25,130  -->  00:03:31,700
plt.bar, it's going to be index plus 0.2, it's

66

00:03:31,700  -->  00:03:36,200
going to be china_scores, and we're going

67

00:03:36,200  -->  00:03:43,070
to be using the same bar_width. And then

68

00:03:43,070  -->  00:03:46,519
f1 is going to be the France bars, so

69

00:03:46,519  -->  00:03:54,950
plt.bar index plus 0.3, and it's going to be

70

00:03:54,950  -->  00:04:00,680
france_scores, and bar_width. So I'm going

71

00:04:00,680  -->  00:04:01,940
to change one thing here instead of

72

00:04:01,940  -->  00:04:06,049
using bar with right here, I'm going to

73

00:04:06,049  -->  00:04:07,910
do this, and then this way you'll see

74

00:04:07,910  -->  00:04:12,620
this would be 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and then the

75

00:04:12,620  -->  00:04:14,269
rest of the space, and then it would

76

00:04:14,269  -->  00:04:17,930
start at the next data point as well. So

77

00:04:17,930  -->  00:04:20,269
there we go. We've got our four sets of

78

00:04:20,269  -->  00:04:25,070
data, but this is kind of thrown off a

79

00:04:25,070  -->  00:04:26,940
bit because now the axis,

80

00:04:26,940  -->  00:04:30,570
or the ticks, are in the wrong position

81

00:04:30,570  -->  00:04:34,440
and also they're labeled wrong. So what we're

82

00:04:34,440  -->  00:04:36,570
going to be doing, well first we're

83

00:04:36,570  -->  00:04:41,940
going to be adding the labels to

84

00:04:41,940  -->  00:04:43,530
the values here, and also an alpha

85

00:04:43,530  -->  00:04:47,010
setting. So, alpha is going to make it

86

00:04:47,010  -->  00:04:48,870
look nicer, it's going to tone down the

87

00:04:48,870  -->  00:04:52,140
the color, because the colors are very

88

00:04:52,140  -->  00:04:54,540
vivid and vibrant and that's cool but

89

00:04:54,540  -->  00:04:57,030
for this kind of chart it doesn't

90

00:04:57,030  -->  00:04:59,250
work. So we're going to set alpha to .4 for

91

00:04:59,250  -->  00:05:00,480
each of these, and then we're going to

92

00:05:00,480  -->  00:05:04,980
set the label of each of them as well. So

93

00:05:04,980  -->  00:05:07,350
this is going to be Korea, I'm going to drop down a

94

00:05:07,350  -->  00:05:11,730
line. Do the same thing here, so alpha

95

00:05:11,730  -->  00:05:16,110
equals 0.4, and then label i's going to

96

00:05:16,110  -->  00:05:24,420
be Canada, and then alpha is going to be equal to

97

00:05:24,420  -->  00:05:28,950
.4, and label is going to be equal to China,

98

00:05:28,950  -->  00:05:35,790
and then the last one which is France

99

00:05:35,790  -->  00:05:43,950
we're going to also set the Alpha here, there we go.

100

00:05:43,950  -->  00:05:46,919
So now when I run the application you're

101

00:05:46,919  -->  00:05:48,180
not going to notice any difference right

102

00:05:48,180  -->  00:05:50,010
away, but we are going to turn the legend

103

00:05:50,010  -->  00:05:52,020
on. So how you're going to do that is down

104

00:05:52,020  -->  00:05:54,600
here where we're configuring the options

105

00:05:54,600  -->  00:05:57,390
for the entire chart, think of this in

106

00:05:57,390  -->  00:06:00,330
sections, like here where we're arranging

107

00:06:00,330  -->  00:06:03,240
the data up here. So here we're creating

108

00:06:03,240  -->  00:06:06,120
the data, here we're putting the data

109

00:06:06,120  -->  00:06:10,500
into the chart, and then here we are

110

00:06:10,500  -->  00:06:12,240
configuring and showing the chart. So

111

00:06:12,240  -->  00:06:17,070
what I'll do is here plt.legend, and you

112

00:06:17,070  -->  00:06:18,510
don't need to pass anything into that,

113

00:06:18,510  -->  00:06:21,330
that's going to make the legend show, and

114

00:06:21,330  -->  00:06:23,130
you can't configure the legend but for

115

00:06:23,130  -->  00:06:24,840
right now these default values are

116

00:06:24,840  -->  00:06:28,350
exactly how we want them, and now we're

117

00:06:28,350  -->  00:06:31,860
going to take care of the x ticks here. So

118

00:06:31,860  -->  00:06:33,780
the Y ticks are perfectly fine because

119

00:06:33,780  -->  00:06:35,340
we want to see that data, that's the

120

00:06:35,340  -->  00:06:37,320
actual scores that we're going to be

121

00:06:37,320  -->  00:06:40,020
comparing, but what we need to do first

122

00:06:40,020  -->  00:06:40,560
we need to

123

00:06:40,560  -->  00:06:43,169
move this over to in the middle, so

124

00:06:43,169  -->  00:06:45,210
between the orange and the green bars,

125

00:06:45,210  -->  00:06:46,980
and then we also need to change the

126

00:06:46,980  -->  00:06:50,610
labels. So, let's go ahead right here

127

00:06:50,610  -->  00:06:53,100
above the legend call and we're going to

128

00:06:53,100  -->  00:06:59,550
say plt.xticks. And, so we're going to

129

00:06:59,550  -->  00:07:01,320
iterate through the indexes, we're going

130

00:07:01,320  -->  00:07:08,370
to say index plus .3 divided by 2,

131

00:07:08,370  -->  00:07:13,800
and you're going to

132

00:07:13,800  -->  00:07:15,750
see now that it has moved correctly. So

133

00:07:15,750  -->  00:07:17,880
basically what it's doing is it set it

134

00:07:17,880  -->  00:07:21,600
to here, so what it's doing is it's plus

135

00:07:21,600  -->  00:07:26,190
.3 divided by 2, alright, and so it's

136

00:07:26,190  -->  00:07:30,300
1, 4, and then it divides it by 4, and then

137

00:07:30,300  -->  00:07:33,389
it equals 2, plus the index. So, that's very

138

00:07:33,389  -->  00:07:34,889
important right there, but then what

139

00:07:34,889  -->  00:07:35,940
we're going to do is we're going to pass

140

00:07:35,940  -->  00:07:38,760
a tuple into that as well, and these

141

00:07:38,760  -->  00:07:41,550
are going to be the actual X data points

142

00:07:41,550  -->  00:07:43,889
or the subjects that we're comparing, so

143

00:07:43,889  -->  00:07:54,960
math, reading, and science. So I'm going to

144

00:07:54,960  -->  00:07:58,200
save this, run it again, and now we're

145

00:07:58,200  -->  00:08:00,300
going to start to see our chart actually

146

00:08:00,300  -->  00:08:05,669
take form. So, what we're going to do is

147

00:08:05,669  -->  00:08:07,740
we're also going to add a label on the

148

00:08:07,740  -->  00:08:09,630
left-hand side to convey that it's the

149

00:08:09,630  -->  00:08:12,150
mean score. So how we're going to do that

150

00:08:12,150  -->  00:08:18,450
is the X&amp;Y label, so plt.ylabel, this of

151

00:08:18,450  -->  00:08:23,580
course y is vertical, and it's going to

152

00:08:23,580  -->  00:08:33,270
say, "Mean score in PISA 2012," and then

153

00:08:33,270  -->  00:08:39,950
plt.xlabel is going to be "Subjects."

154

00:08:40,870  -->  00:08:45,130
I'm going to add a title as well, and

155

00:08:45,130  -->  00:08:56,500
it's going to be called, "Test Scores

156

00:08:56,500  -->  00:09:01,300
by Country." Then we're going to restart

157

00:09:01,300  -->  00:09:06,100
the application, and now we see something

158

00:09:06,100  -->  00:09:08,140
that looks more like a complete chart.

159

00:09:08,140  -->  00:09:10,930
You can also add more to this, and we're most

160

00:09:10,930  -->  00:09:12,730
likely going to, but for right now we

161

00:09:12,730  -->  00:09:15,220
have a good visualization of four

162

00:09:15,220  -->  00:09:18,250
countries in three subjects, and we can

163

00:09:18,250  -->  00:09:21,190
see well this is Korea so Korea is doing

164

00:09:21,190  -->  00:09:23,529
second best in terms of mathematics

165

00:09:23,529  -->  00:09:26,170
scores, where China is doing the best, and

166

00:09:26,170  -->  00:09:28,960
Canada's pretty low there, so is France.

167

00:09:28,960  -->  00:09:32,800
So, there we go we

168

00:09:32,800  -->  00:09:35,200
with that. So thank you guys for watching this.

169

00:09:35,200  -->  00:09:37,000
I'm probably going to be extending this

170

00:09:37,000  -->  00:09:39,070
type of thing even further, or just cover

171

00:09:39,070  -->  00:09:41,200
more options for different charts using

172

00:09:41,200  -->  00:09:45,420
the same data points.
