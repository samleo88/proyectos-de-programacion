WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:03.720
I would also like to talk about the external resources.

00:03.720 --> 00:08.940
And while we're at it we're all going to look at the head allotment and the many attacks that I promised

00:08.940 --> 00:10.430
you in the beginning.

00:10.500 --> 00:16.800
Now two really good resources are going to be Mozilla Development Network and the easiest way to search

00:16.800 --> 00:21.090
it again would be just going to Google and you can just type the end.

00:21.330 --> 00:25.080
Now with Mozilla Development Network it is really good.

00:25.080 --> 00:31.560
However I think that you'll probably gonna start using it once you are already somewhat comfortable

00:31.560 --> 00:38.370
with HP email or any kind of technology because while the documentation is really good they need is

00:38.370 --> 00:39.500
also very extensive.

00:39.990 --> 00:44.400
So let's say first of all if you would like to go back there we can always have an option of searching

00:44.400 --> 00:45.100
right.

00:45.120 --> 00:52.200
So we have an option of searching let's say email in our case and then we have an option for documentation.

00:52.240 --> 00:58.800
So in our case we would like to select the email then within the email we need to start navigating to

00:58.800 --> 01:00.630
wherever we would like research.

01:00.660 --> 01:06.390
So let's say we're gonna be looking for H name or tutorial or you can have the Asian email documentation

01:06.480 --> 01:13.290
or Mozilla develop and airport and in my case let's just click on the tutorial now and editorial notice.

01:13.500 --> 01:19.440
We're gonna have all these options where on the left hand side they right away give you the CSX but

01:19.560 --> 01:24.870
if in the beginning you would just like to understand everything about the email then this is where

01:24.870 --> 01:30.240
you're gonna be doing research whether that's going to be multiple media and embedding what images in

01:30.440 --> 01:35.840
the email or let's say the head element in the email.

01:35.880 --> 01:42.810
Now a little bit more user friendly especially in the beginning would be W3 schools where again you

01:42.810 --> 01:49.800
would just search it in Google for W3 schools and once we click on it obviously there's bunch of tutorials

01:49.890 --> 01:51.240
available to us.

01:51.240 --> 01:56.610
Now again in our case we will gonna select each email since this is what we're covering.

01:56.850 --> 02:02.550
And then within the email let's go ahead and let's find the h the email header element and now we can

02:02.550 --> 02:04.500
start reading everything that there raised about it.

02:05.010 --> 02:12.570
So like I said this would be a container for metadata so data about the actual site and that would be

02:12.570 --> 02:17.490
placed within the head element obviously and the metadata is not going to be displayed.

02:18.210 --> 02:22.270
Now there is going to be tags let's say for the title and we are covered.

02:22.280 --> 02:28.530
Title title would be for the page title but then later on as we're gonna be working with style sheets

02:28.920 --> 02:34.950
we're also going to work with style tags as well as linking the style sheets so linking the CSX as well

02:34.950 --> 02:37.170
as we have an option for JavaScript.

02:37.260 --> 02:43.470
Now there's always gonna be mad attacks and for the mad attacks and again this would be the title and

02:43.470 --> 02:48.270
as you can see you can read everything that there is about title then the style element would be for

02:48.270 --> 02:48.870
styling.

02:48.870 --> 02:56.070
Like I said style element we're gonna cover in the scene as this link is going to be linking to the

02:56.460 --> 03:04.120
external style sheet and then we have the metro element now in the metro arm and you have multiple options.

03:04.230 --> 03:06.410
Let's say we have characters.

03:06.570 --> 03:12.670
Now if we're going back and checking our basic setup with an name and we noticed that our first murder

03:12.670 --> 03:14.570
attack would be character set.

03:14.760 --> 03:21.360
So this answers what is meant attack is doing then also we have an option let's say for a description.

03:21.390 --> 03:23.410
So again the syntax would be matter.

03:23.790 --> 03:27.170
Then we have the name and not because that wouldn't be description.

03:27.180 --> 03:29.280
And then here would place the content.

03:29.410 --> 03:35.340
Now the same old spiel would be for the keywords if we were not keywords author in the bottom we have

03:35.340 --> 03:41.500
the viewport meditating that explains how the viewport murder attack is going to work.

03:41.550 --> 03:46.140
So you viewport medal tag allows us or allows our pages to be responsible.

03:46.770 --> 03:52.170
So again if we're going to head over back to our basic setup with them and will notice that we already

03:52.170 --> 04:00.440
have the Newport tag that sets up the width properly and that way our page is gonna be responsive.

04:00.450 --> 04:06.150
So again if you'd like to research more information but anything that we talked about it this is a very

04:06.150 --> 04:09.540
good resource as well as Mozilla developer network.
