00:00.180 --> 00:01.620
What is going on guys.

00:01.620 --> 00:09.320
And welcome to our next series has legs marks and says great project and this website project.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.150
This is what we're going to be building.

00:11.220 --> 00:17.950
So we're going to start over here with our bar or here with the links and with the phantasmal here and

00:17.980 --> 00:20.000
the now bar is going to be responsive.

00:20.190 --> 00:23.700
So you can see that as actual screen is shrinking.

00:23.880 --> 00:28.990
You can see or hear how the links are actually going to be wrapping when you get to the next line.

00:29.040 --> 00:36.270
And once we get to a smaller screen or here we have a toggle button which is actually going to be toggling

00:36.270 --> 00:37.300
going right.

00:37.440 --> 00:41.550
And we're also going to look at how we can make these spanne items right.

00:41.550 --> 00:43.670
These bars are here like this right.

00:43.680 --> 00:50.560
So by default this is going to look like a typical bootstrap nav bar Barberton right.

00:50.560 --> 00:54.840
We're going to make sure that once we actually click it you can see a few things are going to be changing

00:55.350 --> 01:00.980
then once we're done with the now more we're actually going to look at how we can create or here is

01:01.030 --> 01:03.790
banner right when the background photo.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.660
This is going to be all we're heading.

01:05.750 --> 01:10.230
It's going to be our subheading heading this or here is going to be the button you can see or see or

01:10.230 --> 01:10.630
hear it.

01:10.650 --> 01:17.610
We're going to have a transition effect that as I'm hovering over here you can see that the button is

01:17.620 --> 01:19.560
going to have a different ground.

01:19.810 --> 01:25.660
And as actually not hovering over it actually changes back the car.

01:25.660 --> 01:28.140
Then after that we're going to have a skills section.

01:28.320 --> 01:34.290
We're all going to have again a phantasm and you can see or hear that is going to be four of them on

01:34.290 --> 01:37.240
a bigger screen and then it is going to go down to two.

01:37.410 --> 01:43.950
And once we had hit a smaller screen this is going to be a single or here skill.

01:44.070 --> 01:50.060
And then after that if we're hovering You can see that we're going to be using a zooming in fact that's

01:50.070 --> 01:52.570
going to be transformation.

01:52.660 --> 01:55.200
We're basically we're going to be scaling it down.

01:55.360 --> 02:01.840
Then after that we're going to have a section where you actually going to have a video also.

02:02.010 --> 02:04.120
So first this is going to be our text.

02:04.230 --> 02:09.330
And then over here we're going to have a video that's going to be actually if we click it we're going

02:09.330 --> 02:11.280
to be playing the video on our Web site.

02:11.490 --> 02:17.530
Then after that we're going to have a services section or here and you can see it with all the titles.

02:17.730 --> 02:24.570
We're going to have a hovering effect where as we were hovering over the title the underline over here

02:24.870 --> 02:28.590
is not only going to expand but it's also going to change a color.

02:28.680 --> 02:33.910
And in fact I'm going to go back and see that it's going to go back to its original size.

02:33.950 --> 02:37.070
Now this is going to be a services section.

02:37.210 --> 02:42.870
We're going to have a three of them three services in each line and total is going to be six.

02:42.990 --> 02:48.480
And over here you can see that we're going to be using the flex box to set them side by side and we're

02:48.480 --> 02:55.730
going to look at how we can create over here these six of them right so how to actually make sure that

02:55.760 --> 02:57.310
we have six in one line.

02:57.540 --> 03:01.050
And once we again go to the smaller screen this is responsive.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.480
So this turns to two.

03:02.790 --> 03:08.500
Then after that we can have a portfolio section we're all going to place six images again.

03:08.790 --> 03:10.900
And we're going to have a hovering in fact.

03:11.070 --> 03:19.410
So as I'm hovering over the image you can see that from the bottom there is going to be a line job name

03:19.660 --> 03:22.420
and all of this is going to be location known here.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.110
This is going to be orderly.

03:24.450 --> 03:29.070
So over here you can see that as I'm hovering the link it's going to change the color and it's also

03:29.070 --> 03:31.170
going to transport itself.

03:31.540 --> 03:35.530
And so it's going to translate itself wide direction.

03:35.560 --> 03:41.190
And this is going to be the link where again we're going to be using a transition effect next is going

03:41.190 --> 03:47.730
to be numbers are going to be using from some here hidings three which is going to be our title.

03:47.820 --> 03:54.160
And as you can see again as I'm hovering there are going to be actually translating y direction then

03:54.210 --> 04:00.360
we're going to have a team section where as I'm hovering over the cards the cards are going to have

04:00.450 --> 04:04.340
a image and this is going to be a title subtitle.

04:04.340 --> 04:06.520
These are going to be phantasm icons.

04:06.600 --> 04:12.870
And over here you can see that as I'm hovering or no link or here this is actually going to translate.

04:12.990 --> 04:17.720
Again a link here in this case font awesome icon arrow.

04:17.890 --> 04:20.180
It's going to turn 19 degrees.

04:20.310 --> 04:25.780
Then after that we're going to have a customer of U.S. We're going to have a image.

04:25.820 --> 04:30.600
It's going to be around and circle again and then there's going to be name a profession and I don't

04:30.600 --> 04:32.300
hear small text about it.

04:32.310 --> 04:37.650
So if I'm going to make it to the smaller screen and you can see that it's going to go up and down and

04:37.650 --> 04:39.040
then it's going to be three of them.

04:39.240 --> 04:44.150
But once we go actually to the single screen you can see that this is how it's going to look like right.

04:44.310 --> 04:46.470
So there's going to be three of them single.

04:46.650 --> 04:50.160
One by one and then the last one is going to be contact sectional.

04:50.160 --> 04:57.840
Here we have contact us again this is going to be a title and here we're going to have a street name

04:58.350 --> 05:04.990
phone email and and this is going to be in hours or here this is going to be a forum and we're going

05:04.990 --> 05:07.290
to look at how we can actually get rid of the mortars.

05:07.300 --> 05:13.270
How can we get rid of the backgrounds and only thing we left out here is this one line here this is

05:13.270 --> 05:14.420
going to send a message.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.400
And this is going to be our submit button.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.920
And let's go ahead and let's start working on this project.
