00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,859
Hey guys, before we move on i actually
found a problem in my code. I actually

2

00:00:04,859  -->  00:00:08,730
put this under the metaclass and it
should be just under the the post class

3

00:00:08,730  -->  00:00:12,389
itself because it's going to be post.get
absolute URL that we're going to be

4

00:00:12,389  -->  00:00:17,160
accessing, so go ahead and save this file.
Now once we're done writing the model

5

00:00:17,160  -->  00:00:21,270
for the post what we need to do is we
need to sync the database. Now there was

6

00:00:21,270  -->  00:00:25,529
a change so there's going to be, i'm sure
when the change happened, I know the

7

00:00:25,529  -->  00:00:29,429
first time I ever used Django there was
a sink db command and you'll still find

8

00:00:29,429  -->  00:00:33,480
information out there that refers
to this command, but that has actually

9

00:00:33,480  -->  00:00:35,370
become a migrate command now.

10

00:00:35,370  -->  00:00:41,760
So what I need you guys to do is go ahead
and run "python3 ./manage.py migrate"

11

00:00:41,760  -->  00:00:51,719
it's this simple. It's going to, the first
time you do it should be correct because

12

00:00:51,719  -->  00:00:56,610
you guys didn't have this in the wrong
class when you did it.

13

00:00:56,610  -->  00:01:05,250
What we need to do is run make
migrations now. So, "python3 ./manage.py

14

00:01:05,250  -->  00:01:13,320
makemigrations" this is going to
create the migrations to run, and then

15

00:01:13,320  -->  00:01:18,630
run "python3 ./manage.py migrate"

16

00:01:27,540  -->  00:01:34,080
Right, the default Python on my system is
Python 2, we're using Python 3 so we

17

00:01:34,080  -->  00:01:41,100
need to begin every every python3
command with the the actual name of the

18

00:01:41,100  -->  00:01:44,310
interpreter that we're using. So, there we
go.

19

00:01:44,310  -->  00:01:49,650
What we're going to be focusing on in
this video is getting the administration

20

00:01:49,650  -->  00:01:54,150
of the running, and it's pretty simple.
All we have to do is in terminal here

21

00:01:54,150  -->  00:02:01,380
we're going to run "python3 ./manage.py"
and then we're just going to pass it the

22

00:02:01,380  -->  00:02:08,940
argument create superuser, all one word, so "createsuperuser" This is going to

23

00:02:08,940  -->  00:02:14,040
create a superuser and we're going to be
able to, it's going to use my username by

24

00:02:14,040  -->  00:02:22,170
default, so my email is going to go in
here, and then my password is going to be

25

00:02:22,170  -->  00:02:25,170
"avocado1"

26

00:02:26,880  -->  00:02:38,400
alright. So now we're going to run the
server again, so "runserver" Now if you go to your

27

00:02:38,400  -->  00:02:45,030
address here /admin it's going to take you
to this login page, so i'm going to go

28

00:02:45,030  -->  00:02:50,760
ahead and login, and you should see this

29

00:02:50,760  -->  00:02:56,760
and that's exactly what we want to see.
What we need to do in order to get our

30

00:02:56,760  -->  00:03:03,480
posts working in the administration, we're
going to jump into PyCharm here, and

31

00:03:03,480  -->  00:03:12,750
we're going to go into admin right here, and we're going to just register our model

32

00:03:12,750  -->  00:03:17,820
that we've written, the post model. So
let's go ahead and write "from .models

33

00:03:17,820  -->  00:03:25,200
import Post" and then we're going to
register the model and how you register

34

00:03:25,200  -->  00:03:30,600
a model that you write, obviously first
you have to import it, and then you need

35

00:03:30,600  -->  00:03:37,350
to run this command "admin.site .register(Post)" then what ever model you want

36

00:03:37,350  -->  00:03:38,980
to register, so in this instance

37

00:03:38,980  -->  00:03:46,269
it's post. Going to go ahead and save
this, we're going to rerun the server, I

38

00:03:46,269  -->  00:03:57,760
can probably run this in here. I can
configure this I bet, let me see if we

39

00:03:57,760  -->  00:04:09,549
can configure manage here to run with
run server, let me see. Up here run, edit

40

00:04:09,549  -->  00:04:19,720
configurations, i'm going to add run server
in here, and we're going to run, it should

41

00:04:19,720  -->  00:04:20,350
run.

42

00:04:20,350  -->  00:04:30,370
No, let's try again. Oh, right here,

43

00:04:30,370  -->  00:04:37,060
Script parameters, "runserver" There, alright. So now when we run it, it should run the

44

00:04:37,060  -->  00:04:43,180
server so we don't have to go into
terminal each, time. So I can open up

45

00:04:43,180  -->  00:04:44,500
terminal here

46

00:04:44,500  -->  00:04:48,490
cancel out here, and I can actually just
close that now and we should be able to

47

00:04:48,490  -->  00:04:52,960
run from right within here and we can. So,
this is gonna make things a lot easier.

48

00:04:52,960  -->  00:04:58,960
We just re-ran and so let's go ahead and
open up the Django admin again, let's

49

00:04:58,960  -->  00:05:04,419
refresh, and now you'll see in our blog
here we have posts and we can come here and

50

00:05:04,419  -->  00:05:07,960
we can get a list and edit posts, but we
don't have any posts so we can go ahead

51

00:05:07,960  -->  00:05:16,000
and add one. So, i'm going to name this "My first post" the slug is going to be

52

00:05:16,000  -->  00:05:22,210
"my-first-post" The summary here
we can actually turn that into a text

53

00:05:22,210  -->  00:05:28,240
area as well, but for right now i'm going
to write, "The first post that I've

54

00:05:28,240  -->  00:05:38,830
created from within the django project."
and we need some lipsum. I think it's

55

00:05:38,830  -->  00:05:40,210
.com,

56

00:05:40,210  -->  00:05:43,380
yeah there we go.

57

00:05:43,380  -->  00:05:51,330
Let's copy this, and I mean we still don't have any views so we're not going to be able

58

00:05:51,330  -->  00:05:54,780
to see this right now, we're going to be
creating views I believe in the next

59

00:05:54,780  -->  00:06:06,180
video, so let's save this. Now we see post
object right here, so we can see our our

60

00:06:06,180  -->  00:06:06,690
posts.
