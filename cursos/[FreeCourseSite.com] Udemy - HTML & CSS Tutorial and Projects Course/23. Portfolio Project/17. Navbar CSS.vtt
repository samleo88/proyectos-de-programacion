00:00.390 --> 00:05.840
So let's go to our main CSSA And actually let's go all the way to the top.

00:06.060 --> 00:09.240
You can see that we started working on a novel here.

00:09.360 --> 00:14.990
We had a nav with a background of light and now is going to hand some more styles.

00:15.210 --> 00:19.030
So first things first we have a nav we're here.

00:19.260 --> 00:21.040
So what we would want for her.

00:21.270 --> 00:26.330
Well first of all like I said and I would want to have a display and we're going to do with this play

00:26.820 --> 00:29.070
reflects on this.

00:29.190 --> 00:35.490
So we're going to have a display of flex and I can see that the actual buttons are here and the logo

00:35.490 --> 00:36.760
is still here.

00:36.810 --> 00:41.070
Now once we have the display flex we're going to have a just different content.

00:41.070 --> 00:43.470
This is going to be space between.

00:43.470 --> 00:47.530
So we're going to make sure that there is more than enough space in between.

00:47.570 --> 00:53.090
We're going to do a padding zero point to five RPMs and 100.

00:53.460 --> 01:02.190
So top bottom is going to be 0.35 and left and right is going to be one aria or he'll do a border bottom

01:03.270 --> 01:14.120
water bottom and for the bottom we would want or here 0.5 RPMs solid or solid.

01:14.190 --> 01:19.150
And let's do all here we are all going to have a bar and this is going to be dark.

01:19.410 --> 01:22.150
So this is going to be our dark border.

01:22.470 --> 01:28.830
Now once we have the border and actually work with a button on you so we're going to go ahead and we're

01:28.830 --> 01:31.320
going to say Nav. median.

01:31.350 --> 01:36.060
So for that button we would want the font size area here.

01:36.090 --> 01:38.430
This is going to be three rpms.

01:38.520 --> 01:43.380
So this is going to be the big but no matter how you want to place it in the center.

01:43.520 --> 01:52.230
And we know that since this is a child on here we can do a line self to center or so once a center as

01:52.230 --> 01:54.300
you can see that button is going to be sitting.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.050
All right.

01:55.260 --> 02:01.430
Now once you have it in the center let's do a color and the caller is going to be work and let's do

02:01.440 --> 02:03.450
a great one on this.

02:03.450 --> 02:09.730
So now we are button is actually right now since the button has been styled.

02:09.750 --> 02:15.550
Now we can do a lynx or here these are going to be all the links are here we're going to say this and

02:15.580 --> 02:16.820
this is going to be now.

02:17.160 --> 02:18.860
On here are the links.

02:18.870 --> 02:25.030
No for the whole links for the list would want list style type.

02:25.080 --> 02:31.330
None on here to get rid of these bullet points and all retailers do also background.

02:31.590 --> 02:38.380
So in the background we're going to say all this is going to be our Vohra and also going to do a great

02:38.380 --> 02:39.930
one on this.

02:40.150 --> 02:42.070
So these are going to be our links.

02:42.100 --> 02:46.820
Now once we have good links then we would want to work with each and every link.

02:47.050 --> 02:50.350
We know that we have a class in the actual link.

02:50.440 --> 02:55.700
This is going to mean have your single link on your site.

02:55.810 --> 02:57.090
This is going to be the single.

02:57.310 --> 03:02.930
Now if we're not singling first we would want this play and we're going to say display block right.

03:03.280 --> 03:08.500
And once we have the display more than we would want text decoration.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.350
None.

03:09.370 --> 03:12.580
Just to get rid of these annoying lines.

03:12.840 --> 03:19.230
And we also want to change the font size 1.5 RPMs on this.

03:19.360 --> 03:23.180
So now they're bigger than we would want to do a painting.

03:23.220 --> 03:31.210
Now for the padding we're going to say 0.5 RPMs and one or E-M or here so top and bottom is going to

03:31.210 --> 03:33.790
be you know five of them one is going to be all here.

03:34.060 --> 03:36.470
So basically we can see that we don't have the right side.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.500
So it was going to be dealing with the left side or.

03:39.670 --> 03:47.500
And once we have one or am We're going to have a font style eat taluk on this.

03:47.560 --> 03:55.360
This is going to be taluk style and then we will have a text transform capitalize with a capital letter

03:55.780 --> 03:56.640
color.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.000
Do a color again of we are now in this case.

04:00.010 --> 04:01.580
This is going to be the orange color.

04:01.780 --> 04:08.680
Just to make some changes here we're going to say that text is going to be orange and then we have a

04:08.680 --> 04:09.790
transition.

04:09.850 --> 04:14.520
So basically as you can see or hear as I'm hovering we're going to add a little bit of padding on here

04:14.540 --> 04:16.470
and the color is also going to change.

04:16.470 --> 04:18.930
So again and we're going to do it over time.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.060
So this is going to be a transition.

04:22.470 --> 04:28.330
We're one animal going to say all one second linear like this.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.380
And this is going to be our transition.

04:30.470 --> 04:33.030
Now let's do the actual hovering effect.

04:33.050 --> 04:42.220
So this is going to be Nav. single over here link and let's do a cover or here so let's do a background

04:42.220 --> 04:46.090
first Magra on var and let's do the right one.

04:46.360 --> 04:50.250
So we're all going to say that this is going to be the light color as we're having.

04:50.260 --> 04:55.310
So you can see or hear now I have my light colored then we would want a padding left.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.440
So padding annelids do padding left.

04:58.510 --> 05:05.620
Now as you can see on here since I have over here padding left and right on one RPMs on here what I'm

05:05.620 --> 05:07.750
going to do is 1.5 rpms.

05:07.810 --> 05:09.910
So basically this is going to be bigger.

05:09.910 --> 05:15.240
So once I say it on here you can see that it's actually going to be moving a little bit to the right

05:15.700 --> 05:18.480
because the padding is pushing from the left or right.

05:18.760 --> 05:23.930
And the last thing was do a cursor and the cursor pointer.

05:23.960 --> 05:27.040
So I was hovering this is going to be cause of point.

05:27.040 --> 05:34.720
Now once we're actually done with this we're ready to go and actually start working with a javascript.
