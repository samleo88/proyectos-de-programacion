WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:05.290
Before we start working on our first element which is going to be a hero.

00:05.460 --> 00:08.790
So we're going to have the header eventually within the header.

00:08.790 --> 00:15.630
There is going to be a number but we're going to start very very simply by testing out the Flex properties

00:15.990 --> 00:23.740
just so we can place the text all the way in the center whether that's vertically as well as horizontal.

00:24.180 --> 00:30.040
Now like I said before we start working on this particular element.

00:30.180 --> 00:33.730
I'm going to have to set up some global sea assets.

00:33.780 --> 00:36.570
Now why am I setting up a global services.

00:36.570 --> 00:39.250
First of all we're going to set up DC assess variables.

00:39.330 --> 00:44.760
So just in case you let's say don't like the color because as you can see my main color was this green

00:44.760 --> 00:44.960
one.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.720
Well let's say you like to go with the different one.

00:47.730 --> 00:52.980
So in that case you can just change the value for that particularly as this variable and that goes for

00:53.070 --> 00:55.960
any kind of values that I'm going to have within the variables.

00:55.980 --> 00:59.520
This is going to allow you to customize your project how really like.

00:59.540 --> 01:00.690
That's number one.

01:00.690 --> 01:08.370
Second as your projects get bigger and bigger I like the fact that I can use some global spaces where

01:08.400 --> 01:11.740
I don't have to recreate for each and every section.

01:11.790 --> 01:15.330
The CEO says that is repeating right.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.910
That would be the deal with let's say images.

01:17.910 --> 01:23.400
I would want all my images to have a width of hundred and display a block because I know that I'm going

01:23.400 --> 01:26.190
to apply the same see says for all the images.

01:26.220 --> 01:32.550
So I do like to set up my synapses where there are some global styles whether that is going to be the

01:32.550 --> 01:38.970
buttons so all the buttons look or what would be the padding for the section and so on and so forth.

01:38.970 --> 01:44.250
Now if you don't like using the global sea CSX or you're just bored during this video you can skip the

01:44.250 --> 01:45.110
next video.

01:45.240 --> 01:50.430
And as always you can get the source code within the resources of the video.

01:50.850 --> 01:57.240
Now enough of me yapping like I said I would like to set up some global sources and I'm going to start

01:57.540 --> 01:59.050
with my variables.

01:59.190 --> 02:05.190
Now please if you're not familiar or if you need to brush up with the variables head over to a tutorial

02:05.400 --> 02:11.460
part where we talk about variables or you can also check it out the previous T station project.

02:11.460 --> 02:18.330
Now I'm gonna set up my variables within the road so I'm going to target the root or HDMI element and

02:18.330 --> 02:18.830
you know what.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.870
In this case I'm going to create some comments.

02:22.050 --> 02:23.380
So let's.

02:23.500 --> 02:31.380
Yes as the variables like so and then maybe as well for the fonts let's just leave these funds have

02:31.800 --> 02:35.850
some kind of comment and within the road.

02:35.850 --> 02:40.180
Like I said I'm going to set up some variables and there's quite a few of them.

02:40.270 --> 02:44.600
So to start by primary color primary color.

02:44.610 --> 02:47.460
And again that is of course the name of my variable.

02:47.460 --> 02:50.030
Now my value is going to be hashtag.

02:50.030 --> 02:58.560
And then three of these and then zero the four again if you'd like to use a different value because

02:58.560 --> 03:01.050
as you can clearly see that is my green color.

03:01.050 --> 03:06.290
Go ahead just change whether that's the name of the variable or in fact the value.

03:06.660 --> 03:09.780
But in this case as I'm working with the project there's two things.

03:09.780 --> 03:12.560
First of all I'm not going to have to repeat this hashtag.

03:12.570 --> 03:16.920
Three of these because I might find that annoying as I'm doing that.

03:16.920 --> 03:19.260
I don't know 16 20 or 25 times.

03:19.650 --> 03:20.850
Instead I'm going to say you know what.

03:20.850 --> 03:23.860
Let's grab our primary color variable.

03:23.980 --> 03:29.520
That's number one and second like I said if later on you don't like this particular color you want to

03:29.520 --> 03:30.960
change it to something else.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.840
Well the only thing you need is just to change this value.

03:35.010 --> 03:42.300
Then let's in fact create few more variables like I said Main White is going to be hashtag FFL.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.940
So that's going to be my main color.

03:44.940 --> 03:52.380
Then let's also add the off white a little bit darker white color so hashtag seven.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.860
I have seven and seven.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.180
That should do it.

03:56.190 --> 04:01.600
Then we have the main black main black is going to be hashtag 2 2 2.

04:01.650 --> 04:03.090
That's my next color.

04:03.090 --> 04:05.260
Then also we have a main Gray.

04:05.910 --> 04:12.110
So again we have hyphen hyphen and then the name of the variable and I'm going to go with hashtag.

04:12.110 --> 04:14.590
Easy easy easy.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.170
That's my man Gray.

04:16.170 --> 04:24.450
And then when we also add a dark gray dark gray is going to be hashtag of a f f a.

04:25.210 --> 04:26.020
OK.

04:26.070 --> 04:28.860
Now there is also going to be some transitions.

04:28.860 --> 04:35.760
So let's say as I'm hovering over the button and as you can see the color is changing over time it's

04:35.760 --> 04:37.250
not changing instantly.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.970
And for that we use the transition properly.

04:39.990 --> 04:46.330
But in order to make it easier we're going to set up the value right away for my base transition.

04:46.350 --> 04:51.180
So every time I'm going to use the transition in fact I'm going to have these variable.

04:51.180 --> 04:56.400
Now of course you can make it custom or each and every case but I'm just going to make things easier

04:56.400 --> 05:01.140
by setting up the values for my transition in one place in one variable.

05:01.290 --> 05:06.300
So then each and every time I would like to use this transition while the only thing I need is access

05:06.300 --> 05:07.260
that variable.

05:07.260 --> 05:15.570
Right now my variable name is going to be hyphen hyphen main transition and like so and I'm going to

05:15.570 --> 05:18.660
say that I would want to affect all the properties.

05:18.870 --> 05:27.270
Then it's going to take zero point three seconds and the transition is going to happen linearly.

05:27.270 --> 05:33.200
Now again since this is not our first project I'm going to be skipping on things already.

05:33.270 --> 05:36.870
I'm assuming that you're already familiar with transition property.

05:36.900 --> 05:42.580
If you're not please head over that Oriel and cover it one more time.

05:42.610 --> 05:43.200
OK.

05:43.380 --> 05:50.490
Now as far as transition I would also want to have some main spacing so I'm going to use this particular

05:50.490 --> 05:52.710
variable for my letter spacing.

05:52.710 --> 05:59.550
So again in that case my letter spacing is going to be exactly the same as I'm using throughout the

05:59.550 --> 06:00.300
project.

06:00.300 --> 06:06.330
You can make it more custom and in some cases we're gonna make it bigger or smaller but there should

06:06.330 --> 06:14.100
be some base letter spacing and that's the reason for my main spacing variable and that particular spacing

06:14.100 --> 06:17.140
is going to be zero point two areas.

06:17.160 --> 06:24.410
Now there's two more variables I would like to create as you see as we're hovering over the cards.

06:24.450 --> 06:27.680
First of all would you already have some box shadow here.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.880
The latter one as I'm hovering it in fact gets darker.

06:31.920 --> 06:38.610
So again since our project is quite big if I would want to have the same box shadow let's say all over

06:38.610 --> 06:40.930
my project and I can always change it.

06:40.950 --> 06:47.160
What's the reason why set up the variables so I'm going to go for light shadow and that's number one

06:47.640 --> 06:56.890
and I'm going to go with values of two pixels five pixels three pixels zero in fact is going to be for

06:56.890 --> 07:04.610
the spread and then for a color I'm gonna go for zero zero zero twenty five.

07:04.950 --> 07:12.360
Okay let's copy and paste it that's my light shadow and then let's go for double the values for my dark

07:12.360 --> 07:21.870
shadow first of all let's rename it dark shadow and then let's set it up ten pixels right here and then

07:21.870 --> 07:30.450
five pixels blur as well as the color is going to be a little bit darker as I already mentioned previously

07:30.900 --> 07:40.080
if you'd like to quickly generate these colors you can just go for blocks shadow generator and then

07:40.080 --> 07:46.260
you just click on the box shadow generator and as you see the first value is going to be horizontal

07:46.260 --> 07:52.140
length and we have vertical line playing we have blurred radius as well as the spread radius we can

07:52.140 --> 07:53.850
change the colors and all that.

07:53.880 --> 08:01.270
Now I wouldn't suggest using the all of them meaning all the values as well as with a prefix.

08:01.290 --> 08:06.510
Because at the end of the project since we're using with the flux box and I would like to show you how

08:06.510 --> 08:12.990
we can quickly add in fact prefixes Well we're going to take a look at the extension that I'm using

08:13.410 --> 08:19.020
and the extension name is pre fixing a prefix R which currently I don't have.

08:19.050 --> 08:22.680
So we're going to install it together and then we're gonna start using it together as well.

08:23.160 --> 08:28.090
So I would just suggest grabbing the last value here.

08:28.170 --> 08:33.720
So we have three values I would suggest just grabbing the last one because like I said at the end of

08:33.720 --> 08:40.570
the project we're going to use our our prefix R extension which in fact is going to do the same thing.

08:40.610 --> 08:41.270
OK.

08:41.400 --> 08:47.080
Now that is if you'd like to have some kind of custom box shadow that should do it.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.920
As far as my variables are concerned.

08:50.040 --> 08:53.210
So why don't we do the recent right now.

08:53.220 --> 09:00.480
So first of all let me close the sidebar with me and the comment of where we'd like to reset some default

09:00.480 --> 09:02.400
styles that come with the browser.

09:02.400 --> 09:08.840
Now in this case though I'm gonna go with a star so all the elements as well.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.080
Remember we had before and after.

09:11.220 --> 09:16.860
So we have a before as well as comma after.

09:16.870 --> 09:24.220
Now the reason why I'm selecting these two as well because when we're going to work within the about

09:24.610 --> 09:31.060
in fact we're going to use these before in order to grade this effect and for that I would like to have

09:31.060 --> 09:34.450
the box sizing to be border box.

09:34.660 --> 09:39.790
Because if we would like to apply some kind of padding if there's some kind of with already I wouldn't

09:39.790 --> 09:42.020
want my element to get bigger.

09:42.080 --> 09:48.280
And the reason why first of all I would want to have a margin of zero for all the elements including

09:48.280 --> 09:53.260
the before and after as well as the padding of zero padding of zero.

09:53.280 --> 10:00.810
And lastly like I said box sizing should be border box more remarks that should do it.

10:01.260 --> 10:04.970
And then line by line why don't we add some scissors.

10:05.430 --> 10:08.930
So let's go for the body and what we would want for the body.

10:08.990 --> 10:16.020
Like I said we're gonna start with a fine family and I'm gonna move this guy outside like so and then

10:16.020 --> 10:23.790
let's say we're gonna have the color for all the fans and I'm gonna go for the dark color so far main

10:24.180 --> 10:25.100
black.

10:25.270 --> 10:28.250
That's the color then also for the background.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.050
I'm gonna go with an off white.

10:30.330 --> 10:34.950
So not with the regular white but instead we're gonna go with white.

10:35.010 --> 10:41.080
And again if would like to access the variables with IVR and then the name of that particular variable.

10:41.100 --> 10:48.030
So since I'm looking for off white while I just grab the White then line height should be one point

10:48.030 --> 10:54.900
four and you're gonna see how we change it in fact for the paragraphs and all that but the default one

10:54.900 --> 11:03.720
should be one point four and font size is going to be one harems by default like so one Arias.

11:03.780 --> 11:04.500
Now.

11:04.800 --> 11:11.400
Well then I'm gonna add some more global stars because like I said there are some things that are repeating

11:11.820 --> 11:13.710
like for example for the images.

11:13.710 --> 11:18.240
Remember if we don't add for the images the width of hundred and then display a block will Well two

11:18.240 --> 11:19.450
things are happening.

11:19.530 --> 11:21.790
First of all the image is going to be massive.

11:21.900 --> 11:27.550
It's just going to have its generic or not maybe generic.

11:27.660 --> 11:31.170
It's going to have its general width and height.

11:31.170 --> 11:36.810
So that's probably something that you wouldn't want because you would want to control the width of the

11:36.810 --> 11:37.570
image.

11:37.630 --> 11:41.080
The in fact the same as the parent container.

11:41.610 --> 11:46.560
That's number one and second if we don't have display of Block Well there's going to be this annoying

11:46.560 --> 11:48.300
margin in the bottom.

11:48.300 --> 11:54.650
So that's the reason why I'm gonna have some global styles and we're gonna set up some global styles.

11:54.750 --> 11:59.150
Like I said for all the images there are going to be included in our project.

11:59.170 --> 12:06.690
I right away I want to set up the width of hundred percent so it nicely is responsive and it only gets

12:06.780 --> 12:10.470
as big as the parent container and that's number one.

12:10.470 --> 12:16.020
And second I would want them to be display block so that way we get rid of this annoying margin that

12:16.020 --> 12:17.370
comes by default.

12:17.470 --> 12:23.460
Then let's right away work with all our headings because like I said I don't want to come back for each

12:23.460 --> 12:30.960
and every section and then let's say add some kind of font size for my headings I could set up this

12:30.960 --> 12:37.110
right away and then each and every time when I wouldn't want to use the heading unless I would want

12:37.110 --> 12:39.270
to do something custom I could be like you know what.

12:39.360 --> 12:43.980
In this case I'm going to use the heading for land in this case I'm going to use heading to and so on

12:43.980 --> 12:44.670
and so forth.

12:44.760 --> 12:51.160
So that way you don't have to jump from section to section and just keep on repeating the same style

12:51.180 --> 12:52.640
that we already had.

12:52.670 --> 13:00.420
Right now the way we're going to write is heading 1 and 2 and in 3 so I'm selecting all the headings

13:00.720 --> 13:04.750
adding 4 and 5 as well as having 6.

13:04.860 --> 13:11.490
And for these headings I would like to have the font family of the Poppins as you clearly can see and

13:11.490 --> 13:15.060
then I would also want to add a little bit of margin bottom.

13:15.300 --> 13:23.820
So I'm gonna go for one point twenty five are Iams like so that of what else we would like.

13:23.820 --> 13:26.850
Well let's right away at the letter spacing.

13:26.850 --> 13:30.090
Remember we have the variable for that so let's write.

13:30.090 --> 13:34.550
Main spacing that is going to be for my headings.

13:34.590 --> 13:38.820
Now let's go more specifically for each and every heading.

13:38.820 --> 13:44.460
And when I say each and every headings I'm talking about heading one all the way to four where I'm going

13:44.460 --> 13:54.200
to add these specific in fact font size so let's write font size and I'm gonna go for three point three

13:54.560 --> 13:56.090
for one hour.

13:56.360 --> 14:02.570
Meaning for having one and this is really up to you if you'd like to change these values later on of

14:02.570 --> 14:07.130
course you can do it if you find my font to be too big or too small.

14:07.130 --> 14:14.750
Now let's in fact copy and paste that one to three times and let's just change these values where for

14:14.770 --> 14:15.480
heading to.

14:16.220 --> 14:24.290
I'm gonna set up two point three arms font size then heading three is going to be now let's see two

14:24.290 --> 14:28.760
arms like so to our.

14:28.800 --> 14:35.420
And then lastly we have a hearing for the heading for is going to be one point you again if you don't

14:35.420 --> 14:36.630
like my values.

14:36.650 --> 14:38.740
Fair enough you can use different values.

14:38.740 --> 14:44.090
And this is the case where again I want to show that I have massively zoomed in so normally it's going

14:44.090 --> 14:50.960
to look something like that but I'm going to keep mine one at 175 and just in case once in a while I'm

14:50.960 --> 14:52.460
just going to switch around.

14:52.460 --> 14:54.100
Then we have our paragraphs.

14:54.110 --> 14:58.490
So what I would like to first of all do for all my paragraphs that I'm going to have within the text.

14:59.030 --> 15:05.600
Well I'm going to go for the margin and I'm gonna set up margin bottom margin bottom is going to be

15:05.600 --> 15:10.130
one point twenty five arms and then line height.

15:10.130 --> 15:11.330
I'm going to increase.

15:11.390 --> 15:17.020
So I'm going to set up two as well as font of weight is going to be 300.

15:17.030 --> 15:22.450
Remember when we got it from google funds we had an option of 400 to 300.

15:22.890 --> 15:30.480
Now in my case I'm gonna go for font weight and I'm gonna set this up Rs 300.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.390
Now what else I would like to do.

15:32.390 --> 15:38.510
Lastly since we're gonna use the links throughout our project remember that for each and every link

15:38.540 --> 15:41.970
we're adding It comes with this annoying underline.

15:42.120 --> 15:42.370
Right.

15:42.710 --> 15:47.990
So I'd like to get rid of it where I'm gonna say for all the links that I'm gonna have within my project

15:48.340 --> 15:54.340
I would like to get a text declaration text declaration of nine.

15:54.350 --> 15:58.220
Now we're not done totally with a global stars.

15:58.250 --> 16:03.080
There's going to be some more global stars but we're not going to write them right now.

16:03.080 --> 16:10.280
So as we're working element or section by section in fact there's going to be some global stars some

16:10.280 --> 16:11.360
more global stars.

16:11.720 --> 16:15.980
So I'm just going to write here more global styles.

16:16.090 --> 16:17.660
And that's number one.

16:17.660 --> 16:23.700
And then right after that I'm in fact going to set up for my nav bar and hero.

16:23.870 --> 16:30.370
Like I said we're not going to start with a nav bar I'm just going to create some comments where there's

16:30.380 --> 16:33.120
going to be some stars here.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.460
And that's right.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.670
Now I have bar graph.

16:37.080 --> 16:41.390
And let's add some more styles or stars or not styles.

16:41.390 --> 16:43.110
Let's copy and paste it.

16:43.190 --> 16:45.740
Let's see end of number again.

16:45.800 --> 16:52.460
Now bar we're going to create all the way at the end of the project but it should still work where I'm

16:52.460 --> 16:55.130
going to copy and paste both these lines.

16:55.130 --> 17:00.050
And then let's just change these values where we're going to have the hero component and of course we're

17:00.050 --> 17:02.390
going to have later on some more comments.

17:02.390 --> 17:08.470
But for now let's just have end of Hero hero.

17:08.670 --> 17:09.750
And then you know what.

17:09.750 --> 17:14.880
Why don't we also do the same thing where we are going to copy and paste the knob bar and let's place

17:14.880 --> 17:17.880
it here right after the body.

17:17.880 --> 17:27.280
So I'm going to have a bigger comment where I'm going to write global styles like so and I guess I can

17:27.280 --> 17:31.190
get rid of it then at the end of this guy.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.210
We have more global stars.

17:33.400 --> 17:41.230
But before the number I'm gonna add end of global stars and just so we can in fact navigate around our

17:41.240 --> 17:47.860
success a little bit better where we have some kind of separations where these are gonna be my global

17:47.860 --> 17:49.950
stars and again we're not done.

17:50.110 --> 17:56.900
There's gonna be some more global stars like for example buttons metallurgists right here and of little

17:56.940 --> 17:59.970
more stars all right.

17:59.970 --> 18:06.390
Now once we're done with our global sea us at least for now why don't we start working on our first

18:06.450 --> 18:08.580
element the hero element.
