1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,370
Alright guys, in this video let's go

2

00:00:02,370  -->  00:00:03,810
ahead and talk about loading up a

3

00:00:03,810  -->  00:00:05,460
stylesheet. Let's talk about writing a

4

00:00:05,460  -->  00:00:07,350
stylesheet and then loading a style sheet

5

00:00:07,350  -->  00:00:10,590
into our application. So, what I'm going to do

6

00:00:10,590  -->  00:00:12,150
is I'm actually going to jump back over

7

00:00:12,150  -->  00:00:15,030
to my github repository here because

8

00:00:15,030  -->  00:00:17,490
I've got a stylesheet written, and I

9

00:00:17,490  -->  00:00:19,140
don't really want to write out an

10

00:00:19,140  -->  00:00:21,359
entirely different style sheet where

11

00:00:21,359  -->  00:00:23,039
it's already written. So, what I'm going to

12

00:00:23,039  -->  00:00:24,359
do is we're going to write a few basic

13

00:00:24,359  -->  00:00:27,090
styles, and then i'm going to just import

14

00:00:27,090  -->  00:00:27,599
this,

15

00:00:27,599  -->  00:00:30,779
ok. So, basically, let's look at something

16

00:00:30,779  -->  00:00:36,420
that makes sense. You can target objects

17

00:00:36,420  -->  00:00:40,110
by their class name, I guess, just like

18

00:00:40,110  -->  00:00:42,989
this. If you have done any

19

00:00:42,989  -->  00:00:46,079
web development you'll think, well that's

20

00:00:46,079  -->  00:00:48,030
like targeting a div or a span, it's a

21

00:00:48,030  -->  00:00:50,520
top-level element. Exactly, that's

22

00:00:50,520  -->  00:00:52,230
essentially what this is. So what we're

23

00:00:52,230  -->  00:00:54,120
going to do is let's go ahead and build,

24

00:00:54,120  -->  00:00:55,680
and then you can import fonts and

25

00:00:55,680  -->  00:00:57,180
everything, it's basically an entire style sheet.

26

00:00:57,180  -->  00:00:59,699
So, Qt

27

00:00:59,699  -->  00:01:04,110
basically allows the ability to use a

28

00:01:04,110  -->  00:01:06,600
modified, slightly more restricted

29

00:01:06,600  -->  00:01:09,990
version of CSS to style it's widgets and

30

00:01:09,990  -->  00:01:13,890
elements, so let's get into that. What we

31

00:01:13,890  -->  00:01:19,200
need to do is down here at the bottom our

32

00:01:19,200  -->  00:01:20,820
QApplication is what we're going to be

33

00:01:20,820  -->  00:01:23,549
targeting, and basically we're going to

34

00:01:23,549  -->  00:01:26,040
be setting the stylesheet on that by

35

00:01:26,040  -->  00:01:28,890
opening a file and then reading the

36

00:01:28,890  -->  00:01:34,140
file itself. So, let's build the file

37

00:01:34,140  -->  00:01:35,610
first. So I'm going to just go ahead and

38

00:01:35,610  -->  00:01:39,210
create a new style sheet, and I'm going

39

00:01:39,210  -->  00:01:46,829
to call it style.css. So

40

00:01:46,829  -->  00:01:49,170
now once we got this style.css

41

00:01:49,170  -->  00:01:50,729
written we can basically just

42

00:01:50,729  -->  00:01:53,189
start to style the application, and so

43

00:01:53,189  -->  00:01:54,689
the first thing that I'm going to do is

44

00:01:54,689  -->  00:01:58,200
just style all the push buttons so

45

00:01:58,200  -->  00:02:00,000
that we can just have something quick

46

00:02:00,000  -->  00:02:04,110
done up. So, basically, just right QPush

47

00:02:04,110  -->  00:02:09,569
Button, and then open the curly braces here.

48

00:02:09,569  -->  00:02:12,959
If you guys don't know CSS it's not

49

00:02:12,959  -->  00:02:13,830
something covering

50

00:02:13,830  -->  00:02:15,840
this course, but there's a ton of web

51

00:02:15,840  -->  00:02:20,160
development courses that you can look at. Or, this will probably makes more sense

52

00:02:20,160  -->  00:02:21,900
if you don't want to go and take an

53

00:02:21,900  -->  00:02:23,730
entire course just to learn a bit of CSS/

54

00:02:23,730  -->  00:02:30,240
Search qt5 stylesheets, and they

55

00:02:30,240  -->  00:02:32,160
actually have a reference right on the

56

00:02:32,160  -->  00:02:34,410
Qt documentation, and it tells you what

57

00:02:34,410  -->  00:02:38,340
widget you can style, and how

58

00:02:38,340  -->  00:02:42,600
you can style them. So, I'm going to say

59

00:02:42,600  -->  00:02:44,400
on the QPushButton that the border is

60

00:02:44,400  -->  00:02:45,780
going to be none, so let's get rid of

61

00:02:45,780  -->  00:02:51,959
those borders. The background is going to

62

00:02:51,959  -->  00:02:56,700
be transparent, and padding, let's set the

63

00:02:56,700  -->  00:03:02,730
padding to 10px. Go ahead and save this. I

64

00:03:02,730  -->  00:03:04,950
haven't uploaded it into my application yet, so

65

00:03:04,950  -->  00:03:07,620
you're not going to notice any any big

66

00:03:07,620  -->  00:03:10,170
changes, and so in order to add the

67

00:03:10,170  -->  00:03:13,800
stylesheet to our application again we

68

00:03:13,800  -->  00:03:15,660
need to target the app variable here

69

00:03:15,660  -->  00:03:18,840
that holds the QApplication, and we need

70

00:03:18,840  -->  00:03:20,910
to just set the stylesheet on it. So

71

00:03:20,910  -->  00:03:23,310
let's go ahead and open a file here, so

72

00:03:23,310  -->  00:03:25,890
with open,

73

00:03:25,890  -->  00:03:32,220
here it's going to be "style.css" and we're

74

00:03:32,220  -->  00:03:39,239
just going to read it as style. We're

75

00:03:39,239  -->  00:03:47,340
going to say app.setStyleSheet, and it's

76

00:03:47,340  -->  00:03:50,730
going to be equal to style.read.

77

00:03:50,730  -->  00:03:54,510
I'm going to save this and load up the

78

00:03:54,510  -->  00:03:56,400
app, and we should notice a different push

79

00:03:56,400  -->  00:04:00,959
button look. And we do, as you can see

80

00:04:00,959  -->  00:04:04,019
our style sheets have taken effect. And

81

00:04:04,019  -->  00:04:07,470
so let's style the tab a little bit.

82

00:04:07,470  -->  00:04:10,920
What I'm going to do is jump back over to

83

00:04:10,920  -->  00:04:12,600
my stylesheet, and you're going to

84

00:04:12,600  -->  00:04:16,229
access this by accessing QTabBar,

85

00:04:16,229  -->  00:04:19,650
that's the actual tab bar itself, and then

86

00:04:19,650  -->  00:04:23,190
QTabBar then use these two little

87

00:04:23,190  -->  00:04:25,060
colons

88

00:04:25,060  -->  00:04:28,300
tab. So on the tab itself we're going to

89

00:04:28,300  -->  00:04:37,780
say background is transparent, border

90

00:04:37,780  -->  00:04:40,360
none, and then we're going to set a border on

91

00:04:40,360  -->  00:04:42,040
the right-hand side and the reason is,

92

00:04:42,040  -->  00:04:45,070
actually let's not set any border right now.

93

00:04:45,070  -->  00:04:47,770
So I'm going to save this, I'm actually

94

00:04:47,770  -->  00:04:51,310
going to put padding 10 pixels, and font

95

00:04:51,310  -->  00:04:56,740
size is going to be 14 pixels. So save

96

00:04:56,740  -->  00:05:03,669
this, and load it back up, and you'll see

97

00:05:03,669  -->  00:05:05,860
that my tab now looks a lot bigger, but

98

00:05:05,860  -->  00:05:08,560
you can't really define it from other tabs

99

00:05:08,560  -->  00:05:10,840
because there's no border or anything. So what I'm going

100

00:05:10,840  -->  00:05:14,139
to do now is style the address bar which

101

00:05:14,139  -->  00:05:18,880
is a QVBoxLayout, it

102

00:05:18,880  -->  00:05:21,880
is but I need to check the overlying

103

00:05:21,880  -->  00:05:24,700
widget there, and I'm going to add an object

104

00:05:24,700  -->  00:05:28,270
name to it I think. It's called the

105

00:05:28,270  -->  00:05:35,020
toolbar so the toolbar is right here, and

106

00:05:35,020  -->  00:05:38,110
there's no name on it yet, so self.

107

00:05:38,110  -->  00:05:43,539
Toolbar.setObjectName, and I'm going to set

108

00:05:43,539  -->  00:05:47,680
it to "Toolbar" Now what we can do with

109

00:05:47,680  -->  00:05:52,780
object names in the CSS file right

110

00:05:52,780  -->  00:05:54,669
here, you can use them as you would use an

111

00:05:54,669  -->  00:05:59,110
ID in CSS. So just put a hash symbol and

112

00:05:59,110  -->  00:06:02,380
then the name of the object, and what

113

00:06:02,380  -->  00:06:03,460
we're going to do here is I'm going to set

114

00:06:03,460  -->  00:06:08,740
the background to white, and border-bottom

115

00:06:08,740  -->  00:06:14,560
is going to be 2 pixels solid, weird

116

00:06:14,560  -->  00:06:18,120
kinda like gray color.

117

00:06:20,820  -->  00:06:26,970
That didn't work,

118

00:06:26,970  -->  00:06:31,800
let me try to figure out why. Alright,

119

00:06:31,800  -->  00:06:34,650
I named it toolbar and that would explain why

120

00:06:34,650  -->  00:06:36,060
it didn't work.

121

00:06:36,060  -->  00:06:40,140
Alright, so when we load it up now we should

122

00:06:40,140  -->  00:06:43,170
see a white toolbar and we do, so what

123

00:06:43,170  -->  00:06:44,490
we're going to do is we're going to set

124

00:06:44,490  -->  00:06:48,630
the selected tab we're

125

00:06:48,630  -->  00:06:50,310
going to set that to white so it matches the

126

00:06:50,310  -->  00:06:53,100
toolbar, and once I get more tabs added

127

00:06:53,100  -->  00:06:55,350
here that'll make more sense.

128

00:06:55,350  -->  00:06:58,800
So, let's go ahead and how we're going to

129

00:06:58,800  -->  00:07:03,780
target the selected we're going to say QTabBar::tab::

130

00:07:03,780  -->  00:07:10,350
selected, and each one of these is

131

00:07:10,350  -->  00:07:13,170
separated by two colons. We're going to

132

00:07:13,170  -->  00:07:18,570
say background is white, and the color of the

133

00:07:18,570  -->  00:07:26,400
text is going to be dark, but when a tab is

134

00:07:26,400  -->  00:07:27,570
not active

135

00:07:27,570  -->  00:07:31,410
the color is going to be only kind of

136

00:07:31,410  -->  00:07:36,480
dark. Now we're going to add border-right,

137

00:07:36,480  -->  00:07:45,000
one pixel solid light gray, and now

138

00:07:45,000  -->  00:07:46,890
you're going to see that this is

139

00:07:46,890  -->  00:07:52,170
starting to look just like CSS. Once I get

140

00:07:52,170  -->  00:07:54,000
multiple tabs you can see that the border on

141

00:07:54,000  -->  00:07:56,250
the right makes sense, but if I'm selecting

142

00:07:56,250  -->  00:07:57,870
this then first tab doesn't have a

143

00:07:57,870  -->  00:07:59,670
border on the left. So what we're going to have

144

00:07:59,670  -->  00:08:02,490
to do is manually add a border only to

145

00:08:02,490  -->  00:08:06,000
the first child, and so it's basically

146

00:08:06,000  -->  00:08:14,760
again just like normal style sheets. In

147

00:08:14,760  -->  00:08:18,120
the same border-left is going to be one pixel

148

00:08:18,120  -->  00:08:24,890
solid, light gray.

149

00:08:25,240  -->  00:08:29,919
Now when I do this you'll see that each

150

00:08:29,919  -->  00:08:31,780
of my tabs looks just about right,

151

00:08:31,780  -->  00:08:39,250
exactly how it is. So, that's how to style

152

00:08:39,250  -->  00:08:41,260
our application. It's really not that

153

00:08:41,260  -->  00:08:44,080
difficult, and you can really make

154

00:08:44,080  -->  00:08:47,440
Qt apps look exactly how you want them to

155

00:08:47,440  -->  00:08:49,360
rather than just that native look,

156

00:08:49,360  -->  00:08:51,490
because when you have a native look it's

157

00:08:51,490  -->  00:08:53,589
neat in some ways to have an application

158

00:08:53,589  -->  00:08:55,330
that looks native no matter what

159

00:08:55,330  -->  00:08:58,480
platform it's running, but for instance

160

00:08:58,480  -->  00:09:00,820
Chrome is not native. If I were to open

161

00:09:00,820  -->  00:09:02,860
Chrome here, which isn't down here right now,

162

00:09:02,860  -->  00:09:05,950
you would notice that Chrome doesn't

163

00:09:05,950  -->  00:09:08,440
look different on

164

00:09:08,440  -->  00:09:11,200
different platforms to enough of an

165

00:09:11,200  -->  00:09:13,810
extent to say, hey, this looks native. You

166

00:09:13,810  -->  00:09:17,680
know it doesn't look native. It's

167

00:09:17,680  -->  00:09:19,000
kind of to match. If you're going to

168

00:09:19,000  -->  00:09:21,040
deploy applications on multiple

169

00:09:21,040  -->  00:09:23,890
platforms and you want a unique look so

170

00:09:23,890  -->  00:09:26,950
that people can identify the look of the

171

00:09:26,950  -->  00:09:29,440
thing with the product itself, you're

172

00:09:29,440  -->  00:09:31,240
going to want them same style on every

173

00:09:31,240  -->  00:09:34,920
platform, and so that's what we've done here.
