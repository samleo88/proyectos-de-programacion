WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:04.340
And as always we're gonna start by setting up our indexation.

00:04.680 --> 00:08.900
Again we're going to navigate through end of services section.

00:09.090 --> 00:12.180
We're going to create two more comments.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.320
What are we going to write.

00:13.320 --> 00:16.590
I think we're gonna go with feature tours.

00:16.590 --> 00:26.640
So why don't we in fact delete this and let's write each word worse then we're going to add for the

00:26.640 --> 00:27.460
second one.

00:27.470 --> 00:35.750
End of and feature two words then once we have our comments next one up I would like to create a section

00:35.750 --> 00:40.480
with the classes again the generic section class with the padding.

00:40.640 --> 00:45.900
Then of course we're also gonna have the class for the feature towards.

00:46.070 --> 00:51.520
Or you can just go with featured so featured the worse.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.650
Like so as well as the ADA.

00:53.680 --> 00:58.760
Now Ida is going to be featured featured like so.

00:59.140 --> 01:07.060
Now once we have this particular setup as far as the section Why don't we in fact start creating our

01:07.300 --> 01:11.000
rest of the email which in fact is going to be the title.

01:11.500 --> 01:16.740
Now you know what I'm going to change with the feature towards the doors.

01:17.050 --> 01:21.950
So I'm just going to say class a featured and then within a section like I said we're gonna start with

01:21.950 --> 01:22.620
the title.

01:22.990 --> 01:30.490
So again we can just find a title then navigate to a title that we are interested in let's grab our

01:30.490 --> 01:32.480
title let's copy and paste it.

01:32.770 --> 01:39.570
Let's look for featured and then we go we have our title and we can just copy and paste it.

01:39.580 --> 01:47.990
Now as far as the text within the title we are going to write featured doors and that's it.

01:48.010 --> 01:50.930
Nothing really earth shattering.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.380
Let's check it out.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.270
We do have our featured doors.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.240
Awesome.

01:55.240 --> 02:03.000
Now in order to have some kind of distinguished layout here within the style CSX I'm also going out

02:03.040 --> 02:06.330
right away a little bit of styling here.

02:06.370 --> 02:09.280
So first of all let's select again both comments.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.400
Delete them.

02:11.540 --> 02:17.700
Let's write featured then again and off and off.

02:17.760 --> 02:25.800
And then why don't we start by selecting this featured class and then let's add a background of main

02:25.800 --> 02:26.910
white.

02:26.910 --> 02:32.140
So let's go with the main white remember that was my color.

02:32.160 --> 02:32.700
There you go.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.550
Now I have my white background.

02:35.550 --> 02:41.900
Then right after the title again we're gonna do the same thing where there's going to be some column

02:41.910 --> 02:46.920
loud so we're gonna do that by featured center class.

02:46.950 --> 02:50.070
And then of course I'm gonna have a div.

02:50.070 --> 02:56.610
So they view the class of Section center with generic patterns already as well as the width and then

02:56.610 --> 02:59.820
featured center feature center.

02:59.820 --> 03:03.570
Now within this particular div why don't we start creating artworks.

03:03.630 --> 03:06.480
So again let's write single tour.

03:06.480 --> 03:15.330
I've been paste it and off single tour and then we're gonna have the article article with a class to

03:15.330 --> 03:24.440
work hard so to war hard article and we're going to start with a image container.

03:24.450 --> 03:27.270
Now why are we placing the image container.

03:27.270 --> 03:33.480
Because I would like to have two things I would like to have the image as well as you notice there is

03:33.480 --> 03:35.710
a date all the way in the top.

03:35.730 --> 03:40.980
And in order to set this up we're gonna use a position absolute so we're gonna have the image container

03:40.980 --> 03:47.700
that holds both the paragraph as well as the image and then we're gonna use position absolute in order

03:47.700 --> 03:51.080
to place this paragraph all the way there on the top.

03:51.690 --> 04:00.150
Now let's start by having our div by the class of tau I am G container and then within this div like

04:00.150 --> 04:06.360
I said we're going to have the image and that's number one and I'm going to shoot for images folder

04:07.620 --> 04:14.400
and then within the images folder I have 2 or 1 2 3 4 5 6 and I'm gonna use a one.

04:14.970 --> 04:25.560
Then let's also add the class of Tor I am G just for the styling and let's just write awesome tor some

04:27.060 --> 04:32.790
tor for our torrents of text and right after that we do have our program.

04:33.240 --> 04:36.240
So why don't we set up paragraph with the class of Tor

04:38.840 --> 04:46.870
and then let's just write August I don't know 14th of course in normal a scenario that is going to be

04:46.870 --> 04:48.220
coming from your data.

04:48.400 --> 04:54.010
So you're gonna change this dynamically in our case we're just gonna set up this statically with some

04:54.010 --> 05:03.900
kind of value of August 14th 2019 name that is as far as our image content container is concerned so

05:03.930 --> 05:10.600
why don't we write image container container and then we're gonna have the rest of the tour data just

05:10.610 --> 05:13.470
to make sure that you don't place it within the container.

05:13.960 --> 05:20.600
So why don't we add a comment here and I'm going to write to your footer and then we're going to have

05:20.600 --> 05:27.180
a div in the class of two or four then within the div we're gonna have a few things.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.110
First of all there's going to be a title.

05:30.200 --> 05:37.580
So let's start by creating an issue for the class of Tor title and for the first one I'm going to write.

05:37.670 --> 05:48.350
I bet I'd venture the venture would say that cause there is going to be my title and then there's going

05:48.350 --> 05:54.980
to be a story for now why I'm creating this in a separate dev because I would like to have a two column

05:54.980 --> 06:02.210
layout where there's going to be a country on one side and then some more info about it or how long

06:02.210 --> 06:02.810
it takes.

06:02.810 --> 06:04.980
And what would be the cost.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.090
So this is going to be my second child and we're gonna have a two column layout now.

06:11.110 --> 06:18.000
Now as for us to in info we just go with the dev of tour and for class info.

06:18.050 --> 06:26.450
Class like so let's make sure we add that and then we're gonna start by having a paragraph with a class

06:26.450 --> 06:36.170
of tour country and then within this paragraph why don't we add a span we our font awesome and overwrite

06:36.230 --> 06:41.740
f a s f a map and then when we write some value.

06:41.760 --> 06:48.650
So we have a span but we're also like to write some text and I'm gonna write China.

06:48.650 --> 06:50.130
Okay one second.

06:50.580 --> 06:51.420
Let's save that.

06:51.750 --> 06:52.910
And there you go.

06:53.010 --> 07:00.580
And you have my country now the second child is going to be a div with a class of toward details.

07:00.810 --> 07:07.230
So two more details and then we're gonna have a paragraph with how long it takes.

07:07.290 --> 07:15.590
So we're gonna say six days and let's go with the second paragraph from twenty one hundred twenty one

07:15.590 --> 07:16.300
hundred.

07:16.540 --> 07:17.250
Not say that.

07:17.260 --> 07:24.100
And of course since we haven't implemented any C assess well everything is displayed one on top of the

07:24.100 --> 07:25.130
other.

07:25.480 --> 07:30.460
Now let's head over back to our single tour what selected.

07:30.460 --> 07:38.240
So again from one comment to the end comment like so and I'm gonna copy and paste it three times.

07:38.260 --> 07:40.660
One two three.

07:40.660 --> 07:46.240
And now why don't we head over back and let's just change these values here.

07:46.330 --> 07:49.940
So we started with our Tibet adventure.

07:50.020 --> 07:58.630
Now the second one is going to be best of Java meaning the coffee Java not the programming language

07:58.660 --> 07:59.440
Java.

07:59.640 --> 08:07.870
And for that I'm gonna set up a two or image number two save it that is going to be my image then.

08:07.940 --> 08:11.900
The date is going to be also a little bit different.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.360
Why don't we write October.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.980
And that's not what I wanted.

08:15.980 --> 08:18.580
In fact I mean delete this.

08:18.580 --> 08:26.030
Let's write OK over and we're going to go with first 2019.

08:26.080 --> 08:30.940
Now this messes up a little bit my layout so why don't we set up my paragraph.

08:31.000 --> 08:31.610
Yep.

08:31.870 --> 08:32.850
There you go.

08:32.930 --> 08:41.470
Then like I said best of Java is going to be name so best of Java is my name.

08:41.470 --> 08:48.520
The country is in fact Indonesia Indonesia okay.

08:48.530 --> 08:50.570
And then the tourist.

08:50.630 --> 08:55.340
Days and the cost is forty one hundred.

08:56.090 --> 08:57.520
Let's change that around.

08:57.560 --> 09:04.120
Now next one up is image with a value of 2 or 3 0.

09:04.130 --> 09:06.640
The date is September twenty sixth.

09:06.740 --> 09:09.960
And again as always you can add whatever values you would like.

09:10.580 --> 09:12.340
I was just spit balling here.

09:12.410 --> 09:17.400
So September twenty sixth.

09:17.420 --> 09:29.280
2019 on the Tor name is going to be explore crying Kong here.

09:30.040 --> 09:35.200
Country is Hong Kong Kong.

09:35.230 --> 09:36.220
How long.

09:36.220 --> 09:38.570
Well why don't we go with 12 days.

09:38.650 --> 09:40.030
It's a beautiful place.

09:40.030 --> 09:42.070
Twelve days.

09:42.070 --> 09:43.180
Thirty one hundred.

09:43.810 --> 09:47.240
Let's say a little bit on the cheaper side let's say that.

09:47.260 --> 09:51.810
And lastly there's going to be a two or number four.

09:52.270 --> 09:57.170
It's going to take place on December 5th so it's right here.

09:57.180 --> 10:02.810
December samba 5th like so.

10:03.030 --> 10:05.760
And then it is going to be in Africa.

10:06.650 --> 10:07.640
So all right.

10:07.640 --> 10:12.430
Kenya high lights.

10:12.430 --> 10:19.110
Lights like so the country is Kenya more you can leave China.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.690
That would be interesting.

10:20.690 --> 10:23.550
And then the tourist twenty two days.

10:23.600 --> 10:27.300
And in fact the cost is fifty four hundred.

10:27.470 --> 10:27.890
Always.

10:27.890 --> 10:31.900
These are just some random values you can add to whatever you would like.

10:32.390 --> 10:38.120
Now once we have our age the amount set up we're going to move on and start working in our CSX.
