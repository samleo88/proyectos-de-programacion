00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:05,220
Hey guys, welcome back. So far in this
subsection we've learned what Webpy is

2

00:00:05,220  -->  00:00:10,380
and how to set up a basic example
using Webpy and how to serve up web

3

00:00:10,380  -->  00:00:14,400
pages, but I mean there's a lot more to
it then we're going to learn eventually

4

00:00:14,400  -->  00:00:18,480
but we're not going to need to learn all
these right now and I don't think it's

5

00:00:18,480  -->  00:00:22,260
going to make sense to go through each
one without a full example of a

6

00:00:22,260  -->  00:00:26,220
practical use of this, and so what we're
going to be learning from here on out

7

00:00:26,220  -->  00:00:31,500
during the subsection is how to make a
website that has dynamic data, and we're

8

00:00:31,500  -->  00:00:36,540
going to be setting up our project as a
model view controller or MVC. And what

9

00:00:36,540  -->  00:00:42,750
that is basically is the first entry to
our app that defines the routes is going

10

00:00:42,750  -->  00:00:48,000
to be the controller, and the controller
is going to go and access other files

11

00:00:48,000  -->  00:00:52,140
called the model, and it's going to
collect the data that's going to be

12

00:00:52,140  -->  00:00:56,789
generated onto the page, and then once
it has all the data it's going to that

13

00:00:56,789  -->  00:01:01,920
to send all that data to the view or the
HTML template. Now we've already learned

14

00:01:01,920  -->  00:01:08,880
about the templating of Webpy and how
to use that we're going to be taking

15

00:01:08,880  -->  00:01:12,390
that a bit further, but first what you're
going to have to do is go to

16

00:01:12,390  -->  00:01:17,759
"getbootstrap.com" and download. So, when you first get to this page you're going to

17

00:01:17,759  -->  00:01:22,680
come right here, click download bootstrap, and download the compiled and minified

18

00:01:22,680  -->  00:01:26,729
version right here. We're not just going
to use bootstrap, we want it to be a

19

00:01:26,729  -->  00:01:32,369
little bit pretty, so go ahead and go to
this URL add that into the discussion on

20

00:01:32,369  -->  00:01:38,369
the right-hand side, and just download
the zip file. Now once you've got both

21

00:01:38,369  -->  00:01:43,140
of those and you unzip them it's going
to look something like this. So i'm going

22

00:01:43,140  -->  00:01:48,090
to go ahead and create a new project
here, it's going to be python, going to

23

00:01:48,090  -->  00:01:53,220
get rid of that, and we're going to be
creating a sort of social network mini

24

00:01:53,220  -->  00:01:58,200
blog posting website, and we're also
going to be using PyMongo as the

25

00:01:58,200  -->  00:02:01,649
database drive force, so that's going to be
fun. This is going to be, you are going

26

00:02:01,649  -->  00:02:05,369
to be learning how to combine a bunch of
different knowledge to create something

27

00:02:05,369  -->  00:02:11,560
awesome. So the name of the network i'm
just going to call it

28

00:02:11,560  -->  00:02:24,550
"CodeWizard" and it's going to be a
social network for coders. So now I've

29

00:02:24,550  -->  00:02:32,650
already got this here, however i'm going to
open a new finder window and i'm going

30

00:02:32,650  -->  00:02:38,890
to go into PyCharmProjects, and CodeWizard is right here. So this is going to

31

00:02:38,890  -->  00:02:43,569
be the directory that i'm working in so
obviously first I need a main.py

32

00:02:43,569  -->  00:02:47,709
that's going to be the controller. So
let's go ahead and create a Python file, and

33

00:02:47,709  -->  00:02:51,549
I'm actually just going to name it
"Controller" and it'll do the

34

00:02:51,549  -->  00:02:58,959
extension on it's own. So there's
Controller.py. Now what I need to do

35

00:02:58,959  -->  00:03:03,190
is create a couple directories, so the first
directory is going to be called "Models"

36

00:03:03,190  -->  00:03:07,840
and then the next directory

37

00:03:07,840  -->  00:03:12,849
it's going to be called "Views" and this
is where we're going to put all our

38

00:03:12,849  -->  00:03:16,239
models, this is where we're going to put all our views, and each one of these is going

39

00:03:16,239  -->  00:03:17,799
to be able to be imported.

40

00:03:17,799  -->  00:03:22,750
This is going to be essentially its own
file that contains all the top level

41

00:03:22,750  -->  00:03:30,340
code. So let's I don't think actually
that the bootstrap material comes with

42

00:03:30,340  -->  00:03:34,030
bootstrap itself, but I could be wrong.

43

00:03:34,780  -->  00:03:44,590
I believe this is just...yeah, okay.

44

00:03:46,600  -->  00:03:51,550
So what we're going to do is go ahead
and go into bootstrap, going to copy

45

00:03:51,550  -->  00:03:58,570
these files, so copies over and we're
going to go into the CodeWizard project

46

00:03:58,570  -->  00:04:04,840
here, go into actually we need another
directory, actually in Views create

47

00:04:04,840  -->  00:04:12,550
a new directory and call it "Resources"
and i'm going to rename that so it's

48

00:04:12,550  -->  00:04:21,370
actually spelled correctly. Then in here
we're just going to paste these items, so

49

00:04:21,370  -->  00:04:23,920
you should have something that looks
like this,

50

00:04:23,920  -->  00:04:27,730
the main controller file, we're going to
have models here which is empty as of

51

00:04:27,730  -->  00:04:31,990
now, and the views container for right
now is going to hold resources, and

52

00:04:31,990  -->  00:04:36,490
that's going to have these three
directories right here. Let's jump back out of

53

00:04:36,490  -->  00:04:40,330
here and go to the bootstrap material, go into the dist this means this is

54

00:04:40,330  -->  00:04:45,310
the distribution, and we're just going to
copy these two files here, and we're

55

00:04:45,310  -->  00:04:53,440
going to merge them in here. So basically
if we're go into css we shouldn't only

56

00:04:53,440  -->  00:05:01,450
have bootstrap, we should also have the
bootstrap material design. So once we've

57

00:05:01,450  -->  00:05:03,910
got that set up we're good to go.

58

00:05:03,910  -->  00:05:09,160
That's the only css stuff we're going to
be using here, and you'll see it right

59

00:05:09,160  -->  00:05:20,200
there. Now in Views i'm also going to
create a directory called templates. So

60

00:05:20,200  -->  00:05:25,540
we've got that set up. Now let's go ahead
and set up our controller. So i'm already in

61

00:05:25,540  -->  00:05:35,650
here, so "import web" we're going to create our "urls = ( )", again it's a list so the

62

00:05:35,650  -->  00:05:42,820
first one is going to be '/' and it's
going to go to the 'home' page class. So,

63

00:05:42,820  -->  00:05:50,380
here we need to start the
application so "app = web.application"

64

00:05:50,380  -->  00:05:55,580
gotta pass the "(urls, and globals( ))"

65

00:05:55,580  -->  00:06:05,000
Now we're going to define our class so
i'm going to add a comment here, it's going to say

66

00:06:05,000  -->  00:06:09,800
"# Classes/Routes" so essentially these
are each going to be the

67

00:06:09,800  -->  00:06:13,069
controllers, so each class is going to be a
controller for a different route. So here

68

00:06:13,069  -->  00:06:22,159
we need to create a class called home. So
drop down a line "class home:" and i'm

69

00:06:22,159  -->  00:06:27,620
going to "def GET(self): and for right now
we're just going to load up,

70

00:06:28,190  -->  00:06:41,539
we're just going to return a string for
now, so "return "home" "if __name__==" __main__":"

71

00:06:41,539  -->  00:06:56,900
"app.run( )" Let's go ahead and run this file, didn't mean to debug that, it's alright.

72

00:06:56,900  -->  00:07:07,909
"localhost:8080" and we see that our
home is returning that template. So

73

00:07:07,909  -->  00:07:10,639
now let's go ahead, in the next video
we're going to be creating the homes

74

00:07:10,639  -->  00:07:17,270
template, i'm going to do a bit of work
behind the scenes too because, I mean it's

75

00:07:17,270  -->  00:07:21,589
going to be static so I'm just going to
go ahead and create a file here, call it

76

00:07:21,589  -->  00:07:30,050
"home" and now this class right here
is what you're going to be generating

77

00:07:30,050  -->  00:07:33,050
the static homepage, so i'm going to do
that separately.

78

00:07:33,919  -->  00:07:37,370
There's going to be a sign up function
which we're going to be doing in the

79

00:07:37,370  -->  00:07:38,089
next video as well.
