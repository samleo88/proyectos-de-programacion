Hey guys just to let you know that starting from this video if we will write any code during the video

00:06.630 --> 00:12.690
if you would like you can access lecture code for that particular video in the zip folder in the video

00:12.690 --> 00:13.660
resources.

00:13.710 --> 00:15.670
So let's take it out for a spin.

00:15.750 --> 00:19.650
Let's say they're all going to be looking for the heading elements and we would like to get a source

00:19.650 --> 00:20.340
code.

00:20.340 --> 00:25.290
We can either click it here as you can see this would be the resources or while you're watching the

00:25.290 --> 00:31.110
video let's say within the images we can start watching the video and then we can posit because we don't

00:31.110 --> 00:37.110
listen to this guy and let's just say in the resources we're gonna have the availability for the images.

00:37.650 --> 00:40.180
So this is how we can access the images.

00:40.260 --> 00:44.730
In both cases the organ can download the zip folder for that particular lecture.

00:44.730 --> 00:50.340
And then as I'm going out to my documents I would like to go to the downloads and you'll see I have

00:50.340 --> 00:51.720
two zip folders.

00:51.740 --> 00:55.490
I can just open up these zip folders and we're looking for the folder name.

00:55.530 --> 00:58.310
And again this is going to work exactly the same for the image.

00:58.320 --> 01:03.540
So I'm not going to show you both of them but we can just drag and drop it or however you would like

01:03.540 --> 01:05.960
to open up in your text there.

01:05.970 --> 01:10.530
Now if you want to save it obviously you would need to use it for your downloads and then maybe put

01:10.530 --> 01:12.570
it in your documents or something like that.

01:12.570 --> 01:18.150
But the general sense would be that if we'd like to access the code that we write in a video you can

01:18.150 --> 01:20.880
always have access to it in the video resources.
