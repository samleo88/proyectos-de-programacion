WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:04.170
The next section we're going to be building is going to be about section.

00:04.320 --> 00:12.480
And so when I have two columns and one is going to be having a background I was going to be fixed background

00:12.610 --> 00:17.230
I'm going to look at how we can create a slant effect and all this is going to have a text.

00:17.430 --> 00:18.900
So let's go back over here.

00:18.930 --> 00:25.290
Right now we can close the script on here and also make it we're going to go to the next page.

00:25.320 --> 00:26.380
All right.

00:26.430 --> 00:32.850
And then we're going to have an About section so I'm going to have a comment about copy the line I've

00:33.030 --> 00:37.100
been based on to say the end of about right.

00:37.110 --> 00:42.560
And then once we have this then we're going to have a section with a class of about.

00:42.840 --> 00:50.840
And then with an idea about it or here like this once we have this section now we would want a two articles.

00:51.030 --> 00:54.000
So here I'm going to say this is going to be an article.

00:54.270 --> 01:01.670
This is going to be about Image class about Image image or hair stand up.

01:01.950 --> 01:04.040
And then we'll have about text.

01:04.050 --> 01:07.690
All right so here we're going to have article on Google.

01:07.800 --> 01:15.870
And this is going to be about and we're going to say next month we have this within this about text.

01:15.870 --> 01:22.720
Now we need to actually create a div I don't going to say about text I'm we're going to say Center I

01:22.720 --> 01:25.810
mean so this is going to be div with a class of about X.

01:25.830 --> 01:31.110
And then once we have this then we're going to write a Heading 1 and we're going right over here and

01:31.110 --> 01:38.560
this is going to be called masters on this press tab and we have a heading one.

01:38.770 --> 01:44.260
Then after that we're going to have a ABOUT text on line here like this.

01:44.320 --> 01:51.850
We're going to say this is going to be a div with about here next and we're going to say this is going

01:51.850 --> 01:52.960
to be on the line.

01:54.390 --> 01:57.270
There's a line on this press tab.

01:57.350 --> 01:59.880
This is going to be next thing after Codemasters.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.680
Then we have a paragraph with a.

02:02.740 --> 02:08.370
What say I don't know like 15 12 words or something like this.

02:08.710 --> 02:13.710
And that's Pless over here where I'm going to have a link.

02:14.020 --> 02:16.240
Right so we're going right over here.

02:16.610 --> 02:19.880
Still within this about Center was going to play.

02:19.880 --> 02:23.750
So like right pro-stem Hash tag no.

02:23.900 --> 02:27.240
Explore on it like this.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.460
And we're actually done with HCM no.

02:29.820 --> 02:32.840
So we can go to style success or mines.

02:32.860 --> 02:33.770
Is an arc.

02:33.830 --> 02:34.500
Right.

02:34.560 --> 02:35.950
And starts dialing.

02:35.970 --> 02:41.560
So here what I'm going to say and this is going to be about right now we just need to place a hashtags

02:41.880 --> 02:45.920
like this and just sort of all over the place basically.

02:45.970 --> 02:49.320
So I'm separating them right now.

02:49.320 --> 02:52.380
First one let's deal with any about image.

02:52.710 --> 02:53.300
Right.

02:53.520 --> 03:01.440
So I'm going to say about image first article or I'm going to say in height 80 view it's more like this.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.030
Right.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.030
And again you can see nothing happens here.

03:04.200 --> 03:09.070
However we're going to see a background you are all here.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.770
We're going to say image and I'm going to say about background.

03:12.820 --> 03:18.450
Right so now I'm going to get these clocks or here or here we're going to right center then we're going

03:18.450 --> 03:30.560
to have a cover cover then we'll will have a fixed and have no repeat fixed no repeat or like this.

03:30.660 --> 03:31.390
Right.

03:31.470 --> 03:37.540
Once we have this now we would want to deal with a about text.

03:37.560 --> 03:43.200
Right so this shouldn't be our second issue that we would want to deal with right now or here.

03:43.290 --> 03:47.710
Maybe let's go back to skills you can see that I have these white lines right.

03:47.790 --> 03:50.540
You have a tarp over here at the bottom.

03:50.540 --> 03:51.130
All right.

03:51.180 --> 03:57.770
So obviously we would need to go back to skills or here and you decide what would we want to do.

03:57.790 --> 03:58.430
Right.

03:58.470 --> 04:04.470
Well probably what we want to do is we would want to add a pratting or here like this.

04:04.470 --> 04:09.840
So I'm going to say this is going to be skills and I would say we're going to have a padding of 40 pixels

04:09.840 --> 04:11.230
and zero here.

04:11.340 --> 04:15.480
So right now I can see that my white lines are actually gone.

04:15.640 --> 04:21.460
Then once we're dealing with this background image right now I would want a about text.

04:21.530 --> 04:30.570
So I want to say about text here and what we would want with an about text we would want the same thing

04:30.570 --> 04:36.430
we do and say height 80 a few words like this.

04:36.660 --> 04:40.330
To say that this is going to be a display and this is going to be display.

04:40.340 --> 04:44.740
Let's just remember that again this is going to have only one child right.

04:44.910 --> 04:50.430
Because the full text was the parent about text Center was the only child right because we didn't want

04:50.430 --> 04:54.810
to deal with them separately we just want to deal with them with a whole image.

04:54.810 --> 04:55.240
Right.

04:55.290 --> 04:56.380
Well the whole block.

04:56.400 --> 05:05.160
All right then we're going to say we're here and this is going to be a line item center line items center.

05:05.250 --> 05:09.780
Then we're going to say that this is going to have a background note here we're going to say hash tag

05:10.140 --> 05:16.800
0 3 2 3 2 4 and 3 3.

05:16.800 --> 05:22.050
All right so basically this is going to be this dark blue background and then we'll have a color and

05:22.050 --> 05:29.150
the color is going to be the white one well white gray 1 3 and 5 on here like this.

05:29.460 --> 05:35.090
And then we have another paddings So we're going to say batting 40 pixels and zero.

05:35.150 --> 05:36.580
So something like this.

05:36.690 --> 05:40.690
And then now we would want to work with this about text center.

05:40.920 --> 05:46.780
So we're going to say we're here about text and we're going to say Center on this.

05:47.010 --> 05:56.410
And when this one we're going to say like this then this should have a width 90 per cent like this margin.

05:56.580 --> 06:01.500
0 auto and again basically we're replacing it in the center.

06:01.530 --> 06:08.330
So now I can see that I'm kind of running out of space so I'm going to create more room more here I

06:08.340 --> 06:09.080
guess right.

06:09.330 --> 06:15.010
So let's go back over here and we're going to say that this is going to be about text.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.180
Adding one more here like this.

06:18.240 --> 06:18.530
Right.

06:18.570 --> 06:20.090
And what should happen.

06:20.110 --> 06:31.860
We're going to say text transform text transform to capitalize like this and just see whether we're

06:31.860 --> 06:33.810
actually selecting it right.

06:33.870 --> 06:37.410
And then you have a margin bottom here.

06:37.640 --> 06:42.960
We're going to have eight 10 pixels margin than pixels and lets say zero.

06:43.230 --> 06:48.030
Right so we're here you know what let's write like this let's write differently.

06:48.030 --> 06:53.150
That's right margin bottom pixels bottom 10 pixels or here like this.

06:53.240 --> 07:01.280
Right then we're going to have a about text on that line about text on the line like this and then we'll

07:01.290 --> 07:05.470
say with 200 pixels here.

07:05.760 --> 07:11.010
Height 5 pixels here and then a background.

07:11.150 --> 07:20.670
I'm going to say hash tag 8 F C and B F D B of D or A like this.

07:20.710 --> 07:25.960
Right now it's Shreck y why that line wasn't it.

07:26.080 --> 07:26.620
Right.

07:26.670 --> 07:30.890
And over here you can see that if we have a about text underline right.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.010
So this was a little bit different.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.570
We actually need to write it differently right.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.290
So right like this.

07:37.290 --> 07:44.410
Now I have my line then we don't want to work with a paragraph here.

07:44.580 --> 07:44.960
Right.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.480
And we're going to say this is going to be about and text paragraph and all here we're going to say

07:51.510 --> 07:56.020
this is going to be a margin 20 pixels zero.

07:56.090 --> 08:03.860
Right so 20 pixels Marnham height or line height is going to be to line height is going to be to over

08:03.870 --> 08:04.450
here.

08:04.940 --> 08:14.010
And Folland style style is going to be taluk Dallek or then once we're done with this now we'd want

08:14.010 --> 08:15.080
to work with the link.

08:15.200 --> 08:21.330
Right so we're going to say over here bold text and we're going to say a link and we're going to start

08:21.330 --> 08:23.060
with a display.

08:23.140 --> 08:30.410
Probably going to say inline block right because we want to add a margins and paddings and we're going

08:30.410 --> 08:32.200
to say text decoration.

08:32.190 --> 08:41.760
None here then will have a text trends one and we're going to say upper case I like this color we're

08:41.760 --> 08:48.470
going to use again the White grayish 1 3 5 here like this.

08:48.780 --> 08:59.280
And then once we have this then we'll have a padding padding of 15 pixels and 10 pixels like this.

08:59.350 --> 09:02.700
So top bottom 15 sides is going to be 10.

09:03.070 --> 09:06.170
And then we have a border here.

09:06.220 --> 09:09.910
This is going to be a three pixels solid.

09:10.210 --> 09:12.220
And again we're going to use the white one.

09:12.310 --> 09:15.810
So I have five three three or five.

09:15.810 --> 09:16.710
All right.

09:16.720 --> 09:21.520
And then we would want some transitions and transitions would be for the border for the background and

09:21.520 --> 09:23.640
for the color right.

09:23.760 --> 09:34.280
So what we're going to see here transition transition here this is going to be for two seconds is background

09:35.350 --> 09:36.410
two seconds.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.010
Ease right.

09:38.030 --> 09:42.820
And then color two seconds his ears or here.

09:42.980 --> 09:48.370
So all three of them right now obviously we would want to hover effect so we're going to say about text

09:48.790 --> 09:50.380
and we're going to see a.

09:50.700 --> 09:52.190
And this is going to be Hulver.

09:52.280 --> 10:01.550
And as we were hovering the color is going to be I think 1 9 1 9 1 9 0 here then background is going

10:01.550 --> 10:03.870
to be a white one.

10:03.890 --> 10:10.440
So that 5 3 5 or here and border color.

10:10.550 --> 10:18.780
So we're going to say border and say color here and let's try this one right.

10:18.810 --> 10:27.400
So say hash tag 0 3 2 and 4 3 4 3 or here.

10:27.450 --> 10:29.850
So let's say Right and let's see what we have.

10:30.190 --> 10:30.780
Right.

10:30.840 --> 10:34.890
So this is one way how we can do it or we can actually set it.

10:35.150 --> 10:40.080
The border color also let's say if the background is white then this should be white.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.730
You going to say five of three or five.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.260
Right so we can also do it like this.

10:45.280 --> 10:45.850
Right.

10:45.900 --> 10:47.990
This is also an option how we can do it.

10:48.180 --> 10:56.250
Now we can also obviously now can see it once I change the white back and just leave it without a change

10:56.250 --> 10:57.010
right.

10:57.030 --> 11:01.040
So it's really up to you how you want to do it all right now.

11:01.110 --> 11:08.980
Once we have this now what I would want is to have all this slanted right but only on a specific height.

11:08.990 --> 11:09.460
Right.

11:09.510 --> 11:14.270
So only once it has reached a specific height we would want that to happen.

11:14.370 --> 11:16.340
But you know what we're here to capitalize.

11:16.350 --> 11:23.520
Let's do a prickish do prickers like this that's maybe add some font sizes too.

11:23.790 --> 11:28.890
So I'm going to say font size and say 30 pixels or here like this.

11:28.900 --> 11:29.410
Right.

11:29.480 --> 11:37.070
Just so it's a little bit bigger now we're here what you need is media screen green and we're going

11:37.070 --> 11:49.040
to see and hear remain with more hair and the men with us is actually going to be a 9 9 2 or you know

11:49.040 --> 11:54.850
a sort of 7:36 776 pixels here.

11:55.220 --> 12:02.870
Once we have this we're going to say about right now we're going to have a display of flex splay flex

12:02.870 --> 12:03.620
or here.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.830
So let's check it out what we have here.

12:05.830 --> 12:09.240
All right so this is what we are working on right now.

12:09.260 --> 12:11.530
This should be a display flex.

12:11.550 --> 12:11.960
Right.

12:11.980 --> 12:13.240
So as we refresh it.

12:13.240 --> 12:13.800
Right.

12:13.940 --> 12:15.460
This is how it's going to look like.

12:15.600 --> 12:15.900
Right.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.740
Or here and let's just check with the next issue him now.

12:19.760 --> 12:20.440
All right.

12:20.480 --> 12:24.430
This was an about image and this was an article right.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.180
So what are we going to do over here.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.790
Right now we have a bolt of display flex.

12:30.050 --> 12:35.890
Then over here we're going to say about text and the text is going to be on here like this.

12:35.890 --> 12:36.410
Right.

12:36.450 --> 12:44.830
I'm going to say 4 x 0 0 30 percent or you're like this then 40 about image.

12:44.850 --> 12:45.620
All right.

12:45.740 --> 12:46.940
We're going to say this.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.120
This shouldn't be honestly 70 percent.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.830
So about image here.

12:52.090 --> 13:04.910
And we're going to say flex and 0 0 70 percent or here and now we would want to have this slanted part

13:04.930 --> 13:05.510
right.

13:05.510 --> 13:10.570
So once we refresh right now I can see that image but I want to make this line here right.

13:10.610 --> 13:12.080
That's what I would want right now.

13:12.260 --> 13:19.500
So what I'm going to do over here I'm going to say this is going to be clip path clip.

13:19.720 --> 13:28.680
We're here and we're going to say polygon we're here and here we're going to use 0 0.

13:28.690 --> 13:30.600
All right we're going to start with zero.

13:30.800 --> 13:37.400
Then we'll have 100 percent here then we'll have another zero and then we'll have 15 100 percent.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.540
So basically what I'm doing is what I'm saying is this right now right.

13:40.790 --> 13:48.960
So if this is 0 0 0 for x 0 for y this is going to be harder for X and still zero for why.

13:48.990 --> 13:50.790
Right because it's all the way there.

13:50.960 --> 13:58.200
However over here this should be a hundred for X and a hundred for a Y.

13:58.340 --> 14:01.290
And this should be zero for X and 100 for Y.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.030
Right.

14:02.180 --> 14:04.540
When I want do here is like this right.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.210
I'm just going to create this line.

14:06.290 --> 14:11.450
So this is going to be 00 this is going to be hundred and 0 and then we're going to change the third

14:11.450 --> 14:12.290
and fourth.

14:12.350 --> 14:13.100
Right.

14:13.100 --> 14:18.110
So 0 4 x 0 for y hundred for x 0 for a Y.

14:18.230 --> 14:25.970
And over here we're going to say 50 percent for x 100 percent for y no karma zero.

14:26.090 --> 14:29.100
And this is going to be 100 percent right again.

14:29.330 --> 14:35.960
We're going to go back to the normal stage where we have a zero for X and 100 for Y or here right.

14:35.960 --> 14:39.280
So it's taken out when we have fresh.

14:39.380 --> 14:41.890
Right now I can see what we have over here right.

14:42.140 --> 14:47.570
So this the last one is going to be the same but this is the only valid changed.

14:47.620 --> 14:52.430
Now I can see how what kind of shape we got right now obviously for the whole thing.

14:52.430 --> 14:58.520
Now what we will need is a background so I'm going to say about what we're going to say back ground

14:59.190 --> 15:05.430
and we're going to say hash tag 0 3 this 2 4.

15:05.630 --> 15:07.220
And then we have three.

15:07.220 --> 15:11.740
So basically what I'm saying is for the whole About section have this background.

15:11.840 --> 15:12.080
Right.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.770
So once I refresh.

15:14.030 --> 15:15.660
Now we have this right.

15:15.690 --> 15:17.750
So this is one of the ways that we can do it.
