Hi guys and welcome to our next topic.

00:03.120 --> 00:11.610
The flexible box module or just simply flex box since this flex box was designed as one dimensional

00:11.610 --> 00:14.760
layout module to make our lives easier.

00:14.880 --> 00:22.840
When it comes to spacing items in the row or in the column as an example would just fuel lines of code.

00:23.040 --> 00:31.360
We can create nice evenly spaced no more place text in the center of the image horizontally and vertically.

00:31.500 --> 00:35.470
Can you design your whole project with just using flex box.

00:35.490 --> 00:42.480
Probably but it's safe to say that in that particular case using C as grid would make a little bit more

00:42.480 --> 00:43.380
sense.

00:43.440 --> 00:48.510
As a side note Sears says grid is going to be our next big topic.

00:48.510 --> 00:55.650
Speaking of Sears says grid there is this idea that once Sears as grid arrived flex box is dead and

00:55.650 --> 00:56.610
useless.

00:56.610 --> 01:02.110
And even though I can speak only for myself it could not be further from the truth.

01:02.130 --> 01:09.180
They both have their own use cases and in my opinion using Sears as grid for everything is more of a

01:09.180 --> 01:11.630
fashion statement than anything else.

01:11.640 --> 01:16.240
There are still certain layouts where I find myself reaching forces as flex box.

01:16.410 --> 01:23.370
Even though it will be possible to use this as grid in order to make my workflow faster and easier.

01:23.460 --> 01:26.240
Now let's address the elephant in the room.

01:26.400 --> 01:34.460
The browser support for C assess flex box so if we had over 2 Can I use dot com.

01:34.500 --> 01:41.630
We can see that at the time of this recording global support is almost ninety nine percent and ninety

01:41.630 --> 01:44.430
seven percent when on prefixed.

01:44.430 --> 01:47.520
Which in my opinion is just awesome.

01:47.520 --> 01:54.860
Since all the major browsers supported and this is a CSF course I am only going to focus on the Flex

01:54.860 --> 02:00.750
box syntax and the use cases not support for replacement for older browsers.

02:00.750 --> 02:06.410
If that is something that you are interested in please use the rise other online resources.

02:06.570 --> 02:13.110
As far as previous years ago during tutorial and the project I'm not going to type them out manually

02:13.410 --> 02:19.410
because in my opinion it is confusing when you're just starting out with the flux bugs and also somewhat

02:19.620 --> 02:24.720
unnecessary since there are tools that can do that for you at the end of the project.

02:24.720 --> 02:32.190
I'm going to show you one of such tools a Visual Studio code extension by the name of our prefix.

02:32.670 --> 02:39.720
Okay now that we know the basics let's kick things into gear and start working with assess flex box.
