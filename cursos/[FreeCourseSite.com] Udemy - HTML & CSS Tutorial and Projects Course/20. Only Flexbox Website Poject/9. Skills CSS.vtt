WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:06.720
So let's go to mine she says Oh Agnes and let's go all the way in MRM.

00:06.740 --> 00:13.520
All right let's make more room here for us and are here again and we're going to have a comment here.

00:13.640 --> 00:19.480
We're going to say that this is going to be skills skills section on this.

00:19.640 --> 00:22.490
And now we're going to start applying the styles.

00:22.570 --> 00:28.590
And like I said before whenever we are working on here this right the first what we're doing is we're

00:28.590 --> 00:33.110
designing for the small screens and it's all going to set all our rules right.

00:33.390 --> 00:41.310
And only at the end at a responsiveness that as the screen changes so does the value.

00:41.310 --> 00:41.580
Right.

00:41.610 --> 00:46.170
And you'll see what I'm talking about when we're going to be actually working with media screens right

00:46.250 --> 00:48.600
the same how we did over here with this number.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.280
Right.

00:49.320 --> 00:53.350
And that's when we're all going to be applying a flex properties.

00:53.370 --> 00:58.880
So what we're going to do here is we're going to say the first thing I would want to target kills more

00:58.890 --> 00:59.950
here like this.

01:00.090 --> 01:05.020
And then we're going to say this would be padding and padding is going to be 40 pixels.

01:05.070 --> 01:11.480
What I'm saying is that padding 40 pixels right you can see all around top bottom here on the site.

01:11.490 --> 01:11.960
Right.

01:12.180 --> 01:15.960
So now that we have padding 40 pixels for the skills.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.040
Next we're going to target over here this individual skill.

01:19.140 --> 01:26.270
So I'm going to say skill more here and then I'm going to say text align center then after text and

01:26.300 --> 01:31.730
center I'm going to margin 20 pixels and then on here I'm going to say zero.

01:32.200 --> 01:32.570
All right.

01:32.610 --> 01:36.920
So now we have a margin on the left and right is going to be zero.

01:37.360 --> 01:40.310
But on the top and bottom this is going to be 20.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.910
Now we're done with skill.

01:41.910 --> 01:46.420
We're going to say skill here and we're going to target a phantasm.

01:46.560 --> 01:53.760
Some say skill some more here and then I'm going to say first off color some are the color of hash tag

01:54.270 --> 02:01.290
to be more here than this is going to be 9 8 and then f 0.

02:01.310 --> 02:01.730
Right.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.510
So basically again we're adding this blue color.

02:04.900 --> 02:10.600
Then after that we're going to have a padding where 20 pixels like this.

02:10.620 --> 02:17.730
Then we're going to have a border radius radius where you know like this and all going to say this is

02:17.730 --> 02:19.720
going to be 50 percent.

02:19.740 --> 02:26.050
So basically what I'm doing here is I'm creating the padding and then I'm going to add a ball radius.

02:26.190 --> 02:28.310
So this is actually going to be a circle.

02:28.350 --> 02:33.840
So as I'm actually hovering this is going to be circle and we're going to have a few more effect than

02:33.840 --> 02:38.480
I'm going to say or here are fun size 60 pixels here right.

02:38.540 --> 02:44.700
So now they got bigger and then after that we're going to do a transition and I'm going to say transition

02:44.880 --> 02:51.010
and I'm going to say transform right here 0.5 seconds right.

02:51.080 --> 02:55.440
Ease again and again we can for the sake of it we can have easy.

02:55.470 --> 02:55.970
Right.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.680
So it's all been different.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.610
Then we're going to have a background.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.780
And this is also going to be property that will want to change.

03:02.820 --> 03:06.060
Again let's say zero point five seconds.

03:06.090 --> 03:10.530
He's going to have a caller here.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.750
This is going to be 0.5 seconds.

03:12.800 --> 03:18.420
Is he over here and now would want actual hovering effect.

03:18.490 --> 03:26.260
So I'm going to say skill and I'm going to say far more however and here we're going to write transform.

03:26.370 --> 03:26.760
Right.

03:26.910 --> 03:30.190
So this is going to be the first property would want to change.

03:30.330 --> 03:35.550
And here I'm going to say scale and scale is going to be zero point seven.

03:35.710 --> 03:41.680
And this then we're going to have a background and a background again is going to be the blue one right.

03:41.790 --> 03:43.430
And the color can change right.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.770
So again basically we're going to flip it around.

03:45.960 --> 03:50.490
So we're here we're going to have a background blue font size white.

03:50.840 --> 03:58.820
So we're going to copy this one here and say color hash tag F5 F5 F5 like this.

03:58.950 --> 04:01.850
We saved this more here and let's see what happens.

04:01.860 --> 04:02.500
Right.

04:02.520 --> 04:04.280
So you can see as I'm hovering.

04:04.320 --> 04:10.160
First of all scale means that this is either going to be getting bigger or smaller.

04:10.380 --> 04:17.010
So if I put 1.7 right this would actually be zooming right you can see this is what happens right.

04:17.010 --> 04:22.400
However if I put zero point seven and this is going to get smaller.

04:22.560 --> 04:26.630
So basically one obviously would be the same as it is right.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.450
And if we change this value.

04:28.470 --> 04:30.080
Bigger than 100 smaller.

04:30.160 --> 04:33.870
That depends is resuming in zooming out or here right.

04:34.200 --> 04:41.160
Like I said the border really or this was this created the circle right or hit like this and padding

04:41.160 --> 04:42.690
was actually the one that adds.

04:42.690 --> 04:44.200
How big is the circle or here.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.020
Right.

04:45.180 --> 04:50.460
Then after we are done with this we have two more things that you want to do and we will want to work

04:50.460 --> 04:51.890
with this next door.

04:52.230 --> 04:57.120
So I'm going to go back over here and we're going to say is we're going to say that this is going to

04:57.120 --> 04:59.360
be a skill.

05:00.580 --> 05:07.540
This and we're going to have a margin margin and this is going to be 10 pixels then this is going to

05:07.540 --> 05:08.540
be zero.

05:08.790 --> 05:14.800
And this is going to be 15 pixels and this is going to be another year again Left-Right zero and then

05:14.800 --> 05:15.640
we're just changing.

05:15.650 --> 05:16.240
All right.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.110
We don't want it too much.

05:18.220 --> 05:21.650
But on the bottom we would want a bigger one in order here.

05:21.700 --> 05:26.660
We're going to say this is going to be text or here transform again.

05:26.890 --> 05:28.920
And this is going to be capitalized.

05:29.020 --> 05:34.060
Then after that we're going to have a font size 30 pixels on this.

05:34.060 --> 05:34.300
Right.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.850
So having three became bigger then we're going to have a color.

05:38.110 --> 05:39.810
And this is going to be hash tag.

05:39.850 --> 05:47.080
And again we're going to use the blue color so we can go ahead grabble here and use color color here

05:47.250 --> 05:48.740
and copy this one right.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.070
This is going to be black.

05:50.320 --> 05:55.340
And then over here we're going to say skill and this is going to be skill paragraph.

05:55.550 --> 06:03.260
We're hearing this and then we're going to say line right and we're going to say one point five years.

06:03.290 --> 06:03.830
All right.

06:03.840 --> 06:08.480
So there's going to be a little bit more Einheit over here and then we're going to say last thing and

06:08.500 --> 06:13.500
I mean we don't need to write Yemini if we don't we're just going to be the same thing right.

06:13.510 --> 06:16.000
Just point one point follow here right.

06:16.270 --> 06:23.200
And then we're going to say we're here and this is going to be with us 75 percent because you can see

06:23.200 --> 06:28.120
or hear it now that text right spanning all across.

06:28.300 --> 06:31.290
And it looks a little bit nicer if it actually has the value.

06:31.290 --> 06:31.710
All right.

06:31.900 --> 06:34.560
So we hear what you see we gave it the.

06:34.780 --> 06:38.290
But now the whole text moved that left right because it has a value.

06:38.560 --> 06:43.080
And now we need to do margin zero right top bottom zero.

06:43.240 --> 06:47.260
And here all right so now again and move back into metal again.

06:47.350 --> 06:49.570
If you don't care about it that's fine.

06:49.580 --> 06:50.080
Right.

06:50.220 --> 06:57.160
It's just sometimes on some screens it does better if the text actually has a percentage right.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.710
Sort of has a certain way.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.910
And now here we can actually create more room.

07:02.200 --> 07:07.480
And let's actually add a responsiveness right by writing the media queries.
