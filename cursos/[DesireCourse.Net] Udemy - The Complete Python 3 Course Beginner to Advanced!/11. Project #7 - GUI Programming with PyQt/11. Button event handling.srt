1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,480
Alright, now the next problem we're

2

00:00:03,480  -->  00:00:07,259
going to face is that we can't add each

3

00:00:07,259  -->  00:00:08,760
one of these push buttons, we can't

4

00:00:08,760  -->  00:00:14,250
connect that to a handler for the

5

00:00:14,250  -->  00:00:17,039
click event, and then pass in additional

6

00:00:17,039  -->  00:00:20,730
methods because it's going to not know

7

00:00:20,730  -->  00:00:22,859
which button was clicked, basically. So what

8

00:00:22,859  -->  00:00:24,240
we need to do we're going to create a

9

00:00:24,240  -->  00:00:28,080
class up here for our bottoms, and that's

10

00:00:28,080  -->  00:00:30,269
going to inherit from nothing actually, it's

11

00:00:30,269  -->  00:00:31,830
just going to create a button and then give it

12

00:00:31,830  -->  00:00:34,829
it's own method to to call it's click. So, class

13

00:00:34,829  -->  00:00:36,510
Button:

14

00:00:36,510  -->  00:00:42,390
and we're going to say def __init__(self): and down

15

00:00:42,390  -->  00:00:44,460
here it's going to create a button so

16

00:00:44,460  -->  00:00:52,500
self.b = QPushButton, and it's

17

00:00:52,500  -->  00:00:57,989
going to take the text, and we need to

18

00:00:57,989  -->  00:01:02,190
actually pass that in here so text, then

19

00:01:02,190  -->  00:01:06,869
we're also going to pass in results.

20

00:01:06,869  -->  00:01:11,820
You're going to pass in text there,

21

00:01:11,820  -->  00:01:16,049
we're going to set self.text equal to

22

00:01:16,049  -->  00:01:19,170
text, and this is so we can reference

23

00:01:19,170  -->  00:01:23,400
elsewhere, then we're going to set the

24

00:01:23,400  -->  00:01:25,979
input or the results area where it's

25

00:01:25,979  -->  00:01:30,600
going to show the results to results. Now

26

00:01:30,600  -->  00:01:32,460
we're going to connect the button to it's

27

00:01:32,460  -->  00:01:35,579
own event handler. So self.b

28

00:01:35,579  -->  00:01:40,110
which is the button itself, clicked, and we're

29

00:01:40,110  -->  00:01:42,630
going to connect it to a message that

30

00:01:42,630  -->  00:01:47,490
we're going to call handleInput, and

31

00:01:47,490  -->  00:01:49,560
it's going to be part of this class so

32

00:01:49,560  -->  00:01:52,790
self.handleInput.

33

00:01:54,260  -->  00:01:57,830
So let's go ahead and create that. Now,

34

00:01:57,830  -->  00:02:03,500
unfortunately, this method needs to be

35

00:02:03,500  -->  00:02:08,000
able to pass in a variable, so v for value.

36

00:02:08,000  -->  00:02:12,740
Now if we try to do this, so let's

37

00:02:12,740  -->  00:02:22,640
just print out "clicked" v, actually we can

38

00:02:22,640  -->  00:02:25,610
just to that. What we're going to do in here

39

00:02:25,610  -->  00:02:28,430
is instead of creating the QPush

40

00:02:28,430  -->  00:02:30,650
Button within the grid what we're going

41

00:02:30,650  -->  00:02:35,060
to do is we're going to set a button to

42

00:02:35,060  -->  00:02:38,870
the grid, and then add the button in

43

00:02:38,870  -->  00:02:42,110
there. So let's go ahead, if that sounded

44

00:02:42,110  -->  00:02:43,670
a little confusing

45

00:02:43,670  -->  00:02:48,380
don't worry, it it was supposed to. So

46

00:02:48,380  -->  00:02:51,740
b is going to be equal to Button, and

47

00:02:51,740  -->  00:02:54,290
we're going to pass in the buttons text.

48

00:02:54,290  -->  00:02:57,709
We're also going to pass in our results

49

00:02:57,709  -->  00:03:01,520
input here, and as you guys remember this

50

00:03:01,520  -->  00:03:04,340
is going to call this class up here, and it's

51

00:03:04,340  -->  00:03:05,570
going to pass in the text of the

52

00:03:05,570  -->  00:03:08,030
button itself, and then the input area so

53

00:03:08,030  -->  00:03:10,040
that we can modify that when we need to.

54

00:03:10,040  -->  00:03:16,250
What we're going to do is we're just

55

00:03:16,250  -->  00:03:21,230
going to, we're just going to add the button

56

00:03:21,230  -->  00:03:24,620
itself, so button.b I think that's

57

00:03:24,620  -->  00:03:26,090
what we called up here...

58

00:03:26,090  -->  00:03:28,220
yeah, button.b is the push button

59

00:03:28,220  -->  00:03:30,489
itself.

60

00:03:33,540  -->  00:03:36,239
So I'm going to save this and rerun the

61

00:03:36,239  -->  00:03:39,750
application, and it says name 'v' is not

62

00:03:39,750  -->  00:03:41,519
defined so that's what's going to happen

63

00:03:41,519  -->  00:03:45,120
when we try to pass arguments into a

64

00:03:45,120  -->  00:03:49,620
connected slot within an event handler

65

00:03:49,620  -->  00:03:53,760
for a qt widget. So how we're going to

66

00:03:53,760  -->  00:03:56,400
solve that is we are going to use lambda,

67

00:03:56,400  -->  00:03:59,489
and I can discuss this more in different

68

00:03:59,489  -->  00:04:03,000
methods if that makes sense, but

69

00:04:03,000  -->  00:04:07,170
we're going to set that to text so self,

70

00:04:07,170  -->  00:04:11,819
text, and now we can capture that v in

71

00:04:11,819  -->  00:04:17,549
here if I connect it...string object has

72

00:04:17,549  -->  00:04:21,840
no attribute 'b' so where is that? Widget button

73

00:04:21,840  -->  00:04:24,690
b...

74

00:04:24,690  -->  00:04:28,889
oh, I set that to b here. So button is

75

00:04:28,889  -->  00:04:34,110
the actual string, i need to change this

76

00:04:34,110  -->  00:04:40,979
name to buttonObject, let's say. The

77

00:04:40,979  -->  00:04:45,389
object and that's the problem when we

78

00:04:45,389  -->  00:04:47,639
start using a lot of variables is it's hard

79

00:04:47,639  -->  00:04:50,970
to make different variables make sense.

80

00:04:50,970  -->  00:04:56,970
So this says arguments did not match

81

00:04:56,970  -->  00:04:59,610
overloaded call, so self.b equals Q

82

00:04:59,610  -->  00:05:08,090
PushButton and text. So the problem there...

83

00:05:10,460  -->  00:05:16,810
let me let me just check here.

84

00:05:21,880  -->  00:05:23,190
OK,

85

00:05:23,190  -->  00:05:27,660
unexpected type integer. Alright, okay,

86

00:05:27,660  -->  00:05:29,760
that's because some of the values were

87

00:05:29,760  -->  00:05:32,040
passing in here are integers, so we're

88

00:05:32,040  -->  00:05:35,370
gonna wrap it in text just to make sure that

89

00:05:35,370  -->  00:05:36,780
all buttons are being created with the

90

00:05:36,780  -->  00:05:39,210
labels in text. So as you can see it

91

00:05:39,210  -->  00:05:41,820
still creates our buttons, but now it's

92

00:05:41,820  -->  00:05:44,280
printing out that we're actually clicking

93

00:05:44,280  -->  00:05:48,810
whatever we're clicking. So that's cool we

94

00:05:48,810  -->  00:05:52,820
need to now make this make sense.
