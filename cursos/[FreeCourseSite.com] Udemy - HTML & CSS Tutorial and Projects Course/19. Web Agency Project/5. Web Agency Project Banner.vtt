WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:04.260
The next section we're going to be creating our here and this is going to be demanders sections.

00:04.270 --> 00:10.380
All right so we're going to look at how we can actually center it would see it says Flex box and you

00:10.380 --> 00:14.910
can see that this is going to be centered here vertically and horizontally right.

00:14.970 --> 00:17.120
And then you going to see how easy it is right.

00:17.160 --> 00:20.960
So what we're going to do or here we're going to go back to in next stage you know.

00:21.130 --> 00:21.500
Right.

00:21.540 --> 00:27.040
And we're going to do a very short and very simple set up right as you're going to see with these videos.

00:27.050 --> 00:31.700
The HD is usually going to be really around maybe ten lines maybe less.

00:31.710 --> 00:32.160
Right.

00:32.310 --> 00:38.380
And then see says is going to be well longer or much longer depends on the section.

00:38.390 --> 00:43.680
So I'm going to say banner with a comment right so and then I know that this is going to.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.490
This was the end of NAV.

00:45.660 --> 00:51.450
So we're going to say now and this is going to be the banner right over here we can just say end of

00:51.530 --> 00:54.730
banner right away.

00:55.170 --> 00:58.570
And then we're going to write our HDMI out here right.

00:58.590 --> 01:02.080
So here I'm going to say this is going to be better with an idea of banner.

01:02.300 --> 01:02.890
Right.

01:02.910 --> 01:08.610
And once we have that we're actually going to have a div of a banner title.

01:08.740 --> 01:09.250
Right.

01:09.330 --> 01:14.760
And once we have that we're going to have a banner text which is going to be actually heading one and

01:14.760 --> 01:20.400
we're going to say banner text and this and that all here we're going to write and this is going to

01:20.400 --> 01:29.240
be web agency like this then we're going to have a div with a underline and around the line.

01:29.370 --> 01:36.210
So I'm going to say that this is going to be death of hour on the line.

01:36.210 --> 01:38.160
And over here we're just going to leave this guy empty.

01:38.160 --> 01:38.430
Right.

01:38.430 --> 01:41.490
This is going to be for our line that we're going to be creating.

01:41.730 --> 01:48.600
They're going to have a beer with a class of banner button and told them to say banner between or here

01:49.190 --> 01:52.020
or here we're going to have a few buttons right here.

01:52.020 --> 01:55.920
I'm going to say is going to be a new and pressed.

01:56.150 --> 02:00.600
No really this is going to be type button and here we're going to say bye.

02:00.850 --> 02:02.570
I'm going to say bye now.

02:02.850 --> 02:06.270
And the next one is going to be about us.

02:06.430 --> 02:15.410
So just copy this one again and this and here we're going to say this is going to be about us.

02:15.540 --> 02:24.900
So I'm going to say about us here and we're actually done with HD now and we can jump to reassess and

02:24.900 --> 02:25.980
start dialing.

02:25.980 --> 02:26.560
All right.

02:26.640 --> 02:32.640
So here's the first thing we need to do is obviously create a comment like this is going to be the banner

02:32.640 --> 02:33.400
section.

02:33.600 --> 02:39.670
So I'm going to make a hash tag and I'm going to say banner on here I'm going to also make a hash tags

02:39.720 --> 02:40.330
right.

02:40.590 --> 02:47.230
And then we're going to go here and create more way more room so we can see better what's happening.

02:47.300 --> 02:51.450
And the first thing we're going to say is going to be banner and are really going to say that this is

02:51.450 --> 02:54.470
going to be have a minimal height of 90.

02:54.480 --> 02:58.670
You whites like this 90 you.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.390
Right.

02:59.580 --> 03:03.130
So now that we have this going we would want a back rub right.

03:03.130 --> 03:05.530
And first I'm going to write that this is going to be you know.

03:05.770 --> 03:10.590
And then I'm going to say images and this is going to be background banner and background banners going

03:10.590 --> 03:11.680
to be our first one.

03:11.730 --> 03:12.070
Right.

03:12.180 --> 03:16.400
And next thing that I would want to do is actually fix this right because this wasn't about you.

03:16.410 --> 03:17.800
This was actually just regular.

03:17.820 --> 03:18.290
Right.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.320
And now we have the 90 view right.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.120
Right.

03:21.150 --> 03:24.650
Then we would want to attach a few more properties.

03:24.660 --> 03:25.130
Right.

03:25.290 --> 03:31.240
First it's going to be background judgment not blind blind mode but by growing attachment and we're

03:31.240 --> 03:34.030
going to say this is going to be fixed.

03:34.090 --> 03:39.220
I mean they're all going to have a background position so I know my ground position.

03:39.370 --> 03:42.110
I'm going to say sooner than this.

03:42.280 --> 03:47.720
We're going to have a background size same background size and we're going to take cover.

03:48.240 --> 03:54.390
And once we have a cover all in the same bag on repeat background repeat and we're going to see no repeat

03:54.920 --> 04:00.680
and then we're going to have a display flex and that's going to be actually for setting these wounds

04:00.680 --> 04:01.850
in the center.

04:02.010 --> 04:03.230
So just for now.

04:03.240 --> 04:03.710
Right.

04:03.870 --> 04:07.360
You can see that with our banner right.

04:07.480 --> 04:12.020
You can see that the background image is actually kind of a little bit light right so if I say this

04:12.350 --> 04:17.820
here if we go back over here and we refresh right you can see that eventually this is going to be a

04:17.820 --> 04:23.190
little bit too light to what we want right now or we can always do is actually create an overlay to

04:23.190 --> 04:24.060
the image right.

04:24.240 --> 04:31.000
So we go back over here which is the background and on the new line here and the near Grady That's all

04:31.140 --> 04:33.970
we're going to add something on top of actual dysrhythmia.

04:34.020 --> 04:34.560
Right.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.550
So I'm going to say this again we are G-B.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.750
And I'm just going to have a black one.

04:38.770 --> 04:40.110
So this is going to be zero.

04:40.350 --> 04:43.290
And the last one is going to be actually the opacity.

04:43.380 --> 04:44.730
How transparent this is.

04:44.730 --> 04:45.240
Right.

04:45.450 --> 04:53.010
So I'm going to grab this guy on this and just I'm going to copy this guy and place a common core here

04:53.400 --> 05:00.830
and another column or here all the way on the back or like this not see that we have this overlay.

05:00.850 --> 05:01.310
Right.

05:01.450 --> 05:06.660
So we have a nice nonaccrual overlay because we're going to be making these fonts over here.

05:06.660 --> 05:07.170
Right.

05:07.690 --> 05:12.910
So now that we're done with our actual background image we to actually get this in a center right this

05:12.910 --> 05:13.550
text.

05:13.690 --> 05:17.710
And what we're going to do is will again use a display fourplex property.

05:17.800 --> 05:24.760
So we're going to see this play the direction this play and we're going to see flex and then we're going

05:24.760 --> 05:34.120
to have a line item center line not the content items to say not baseline center center over here.

05:34.120 --> 05:39.400
Right so you can see how it moves actually vertically in the center and then we would want a justified

05:39.400 --> 05:40.810
contact center right.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.840
Just to place them actually in the actual horizontal sun.

05:45.050 --> 05:46.680
And you can see how easy it is right.

05:46.690 --> 05:50.990
Pretty much three properties right with the values and that's it.

05:51.060 --> 05:56.950
No more hacks no more floating more transform translate or anything like that.

05:57.130 --> 05:59.930
And or here we're going to send for the banner text.

06:00.030 --> 06:03.080
This is going to be the title of the page right.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.760
We're going to say font size over here.

06:05.860 --> 06:08.660
We're going to say 50 pixels high.

06:08.920 --> 06:17.440
Once we have a fixed 50 pixels we're going to say text transform text transform here and you can see

06:17.440 --> 06:24.160
that did a mistake or here actually I need to see my goal and nothing that we need to do to actually

06:24.160 --> 06:25.540
create more room.

06:25.570 --> 06:28.280
So you can see actually better what we're doing.

06:28.300 --> 06:33.850
So decks transform when we're going to say uppercase and so say purse.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.330
Then once we have the upper case we're going to we're going to need a call.

06:37.570 --> 06:41.190
So I'm going to say color and this is going to be easy.

06:41.410 --> 06:43.590
And again zero.

06:43.860 --> 06:50.560
And then we're going to have to be to d be right over here and you can see that I messed something up

06:50.560 --> 06:51.980
because it's kind of pink.

06:52.060 --> 06:54.560
What we need to do is get rid of this guy right.

06:54.690 --> 06:55.330
This a.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.100
And now we have a white font.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.880
And so now everything is working.

06:59.050 --> 07:04.500
And once we have the color we would want a font style or we're going to say Tauke.

07:04.630 --> 07:10.700
And so we're going to go here with the taluk and this is going to be it for the banner text and now

07:10.700 --> 07:12.560
we would need a banner under.

07:12.570 --> 07:13.270
All right.

07:13.480 --> 07:20.890
So we're going to say go here I'm going to say banner when I say underline on their line here and what

07:20.940 --> 07:30.880
you want to do is you want a width of a 200 pixels right here and then you'd want a border here and

07:30.880 --> 07:40.130
we're going to say this is going to be three pixels solid solid and we're going to have a 1 9 0 and

07:40.210 --> 07:45.120
this hash tag 1 9 1 7 1 6 right.

07:45.190 --> 07:47.120
So now that we have this right.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.150
So this is going to be our underline right.

07:49.370 --> 07:57.280
But we also want to add is actually a margin I'd say 10 pixels from the top then we're going to have

07:57.280 --> 08:01.990
an auto then we'll have 20 pixels to the bottom and they're also going to have auto.

08:02.040 --> 08:02.530
Right.

08:02.620 --> 08:04.640
So we're going to place it actually in the center.

08:04.740 --> 08:09.310
We're going to create a little bit more space and then we will want to start styling the actual buttons

08:09.400 --> 08:09.830
right.

08:10.030 --> 08:15.220
So here I'm going to say about an hour and between line and what I'm going to say this is going to be

08:15.230 --> 08:17.970
display flex again.

08:18.010 --> 08:21.040
Right because I want to push them away from each other.

08:21.190 --> 08:26.540
And here I'm going to say that this is going to be justified content and this is going to be space between.

08:26.650 --> 08:27.010
Right.

08:27.180 --> 08:30.870
So now I can see right away how they moved one away from the other one.

08:31.090 --> 08:33.920
And then we would want the actual style the actual button.

08:34.300 --> 08:39.180
So here I'm going to say of beat between and then it's going to be a button.

08:39.640 --> 08:46.500
And over here you're going to write font size to say 30 pixels.

08:46.640 --> 08:51.540
Then we're going to have a spring of 15 like this.

08:51.550 --> 08:58.270
We're going to have text transform and we're going to have a uppercase then we're going to say this

08:58.270 --> 09:03.190
is going to be margin 0 turn pixels like this.

09:03.400 --> 09:07.070
And we are going to have a background right here sorry.

09:07.210 --> 09:09.150
Background ground.

09:09.290 --> 09:14.910
We're going to say transparent talk and say transparent.

09:15.440 --> 09:21.590
Read like this and then we're going to have a color and the collagen is going to be on the six.

09:21.610 --> 09:28.680
He says hey they're all going to F to we have to do this.

09:28.960 --> 09:35.920
And then what we would want to do is actually have a border to have border two pixels solid and I'm

09:35.940 --> 09:40.990
going to use the same color so I can just grab this guy or here like this.

09:41.260 --> 09:43.210
I'll play this one and paste it.

09:43.210 --> 09:44.100
All right.

09:44.260 --> 09:47.320
Now there we have this one a hovering effect.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.140
Right.

09:48.190 --> 09:50.800
So we're going to grab all here this button.

09:51.040 --> 09:57.510
Copy this one and pasted and I was going to say however what happens is we're hovering.

09:57.640 --> 10:03.950
The color should be friend Cerebro I'm going to say this is going to be the zero g.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.800
And then it's going to be to D.

10:05.820 --> 10:06.640
B.

10:06.850 --> 10:12.190
And so this time I didn't mess up anything and I have a background and the background is going to be

10:12.190 --> 10:14.550
the white one right.

10:14.710 --> 10:21.500
So we're going to do is just going to copy paste and we're done.

10:21.510 --> 10:22.160
All right.

10:22.180 --> 10:24.170
So we can go here and check it out.

10:24.170 --> 10:29.010
Well we have and we can also obviously go to the big screen right fresh.

10:29.080 --> 10:33.400
And you can see that everything is working right exactly in the middle where we want to.

10:33.450 --> 10:34.130
All right.

10:34.130 --> 10:36.100
The buttons are working as we're hovering.

10:36.250 --> 10:41.650
And now we're ready to build the next section which is going to be a skills section.
