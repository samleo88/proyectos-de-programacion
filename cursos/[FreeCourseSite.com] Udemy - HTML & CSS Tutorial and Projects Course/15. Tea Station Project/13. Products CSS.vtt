WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:05.370
We were successful with our age the amount but that is probably not the look that we want.

00:05.370 --> 00:06.780
Meaning these massive images.

00:07.200 --> 00:15.180
So why don't we head over again two main CSO style sources and start styling this window of about.

00:15.240 --> 00:18.180
Then we're going to add some comments of products.

00:18.180 --> 00:24.300
This is gonna be commented out and of product and then let's write something here and buy something

00:24.300 --> 00:26.910
I mean first let's start working on a product.

00:27.120 --> 00:30.630
And I would like to add the background the background is gonna be the main dark one.

00:31.110 --> 00:35.840
So let's say background then we're going to be looking for the color and we can say man dark.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.510
Now my whole product section is going to be made dark success.

00:41.520 --> 00:48.130
We also would want a little bit of again padding in between because as you see right now the image is

00:48.780 --> 00:51.990
up all the way where is our button.

00:51.990 --> 00:53.300
And that's not something we want.

00:53.290 --> 00:59.910
So we're gonna write product I'm going to be looking for both of the columns so products info as well

00:59.910 --> 01:05.480
as karma of products in Van story.

01:05.610 --> 01:08.850
Those were my two column names and let's just had some padding.

01:09.030 --> 01:12.690
Planning is gonna be top bottom of two left and right zero.

01:12.750 --> 01:16.230
We are getting there people what else we're gonna have.

01:16.230 --> 01:17.530
Well let's see.

01:17.640 --> 01:22.920
We also would like to maybe work with this product text maybe a little bit nicer and you know what.

01:22.930 --> 01:24.840
There's also gonna be another class.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.170
Now what is that class gonna be.

01:27.170 --> 01:32.550
Remember all the way in the beginning when we were working with these utility classes I was looking

01:32.550 --> 01:38.700
at it and I was saying we can have the text WHITE Now what text WHITE IS GONNA DO IT'S GONNA MAKE THIS

01:38.700 --> 01:44.520
TEXT white so let's say if I don't want to go back and change it or create another class for just this

01:44.520 --> 01:51.330
particular section we can head over here we can say that whenever we have the section title we would

01:51.330 --> 01:55.450
just like to add this class of text white.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.190
And now this text is gonna be white.

01:57.220 --> 02:02.740
So again we do not have to do any extra work in the CSF if you just want a quick fix.

02:02.740 --> 02:04.400
We can just do it like this.

02:04.480 --> 02:05.610
That would be the first thing.

02:05.650 --> 02:08.770
What else we're gonna have in the series as well.

02:08.950 --> 02:12.490
We do have the product text also here.

02:12.490 --> 02:18.430
So why don't we select this product text and what we would like for this guy.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.850
Again we're going to do the same thing with a color.

02:20.860 --> 02:26.020
So the color is going to be made white as well as we're going to add a little bit of margin the same

02:26.020 --> 02:28.740
margin the bottom is going to be one arms and zero.

02:28.900 --> 02:29.530
And you know what.

02:29.530 --> 02:36.330
Let's use Macs with let's say max width of twenty six harem as you're looking at it you can see that

02:36.340 --> 02:38.880
this is a lot like we had already before.

02:39.070 --> 02:41.120
Apart from obviously text white.

02:41.260 --> 02:47.740
So your other option would be reusing this so you could have just said some general name and since we're

02:47.740 --> 02:51.810
using the margin Max with the same you could have done it that way.

02:51.860 --> 02:53.120
That is also an option.

02:53.230 --> 02:58.570
I'm not gonna do it but just just to let you know that you can do it and then let's start working with

02:58.570 --> 03:03.280
these products because each and every product has the same age and all that.

03:03.280 --> 03:07.790
And why don't we start with an image because probably that's going to be the most annoying part here.

03:07.840 --> 03:16.850
And for this I'm gonna say like this that um uh the product image product image is gonna have following

03:16.850 --> 03:23.510
styles first of all with a hundred percent so they're not too big then we're gonna be looking for display

03:23.510 --> 03:24.750
of block.

03:24.780 --> 03:28.630
So I would say a display block and now the image is look already much nicer.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.550
What else I would like.

03:30.620 --> 03:34.570
I don't know some border radius border radius.

03:34.730 --> 03:42.330
And then here I'm going to say zero point four zero point four is gonna be my border areas as well as

03:42.330 --> 03:49.250
we can do a little bit of margin bottom and for this we can do maybe like two arms so not maybe a little

03:49.260 --> 03:53.430
with quite a big what else I would like for the product.

03:53.430 --> 03:56.280
Well I would like to have some distance in between them.

03:56.280 --> 04:03.420
So right now all my products are jammed one against another the same how we had both of the initial

04:03.420 --> 04:04.120
columns.

04:04.260 --> 04:09.080
So here we're gonna save for the product since that is the class that we can target.

04:09.180 --> 04:16.020
Let's add some padding off again to heading off to our.

04:16.090 --> 04:19.450
Some would say to our homes top bottom left and right zero.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.720
Now that should be our padding.

04:22.010 --> 04:24.250
And for some reason this is not working.

04:24.290 --> 04:28.370
So let me actually check this because this shouldn't be working.

04:28.370 --> 04:33.140
We shouldn't be getting comparing and what is happening here.

04:33.230 --> 04:35.580
So we have a section title product.

04:35.700 --> 04:42.440
Text products and then I did not and the class and that's the reason why this is happening so maybe

04:42.440 --> 04:49.820
let me selected in multiple cases where I can just write product and then copy paste it let me grab

04:49.820 --> 04:56.590
this value scroll over here and paste it as well as for a third one.

04:56.600 --> 04:57.980
Mistakes happen.

04:57.980 --> 05:00.430
We just need to fix them and move on.

05:00.740 --> 05:01.760
What else we're having.

05:01.760 --> 05:10.250
Well I guess we can work with product title so let's say like this let's say product title and what

05:10.250 --> 05:12.210
I would want for the title title.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.100
I don't know let me decide and be color white again.

05:16.100 --> 05:23.480
So let's right color not 0 0 but we're gonna look for main white and we know what we do need to use

05:23.480 --> 05:30.400
the main white and for some reason this is not again giving me suggestions.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.990
Let's try it out now mainly white is working fine.

05:34.120 --> 05:42.340
Text transform uppercase would want to be upper case per case and what else we have maybe a similar

05:42.340 --> 05:49.010
spacing letter spacing is gonna be our general one so letter spacing and the Lisbon list we're gonna

05:49.020 --> 05:54.030
have some margin in the bottom which would be I don't know one arms.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.300
So now we're gonna push a little but this text or you know what.

05:57.300 --> 05:58.330
More like price.

05:58.500 --> 06:03.130
And then we have product price before we start working with our mere equals.

06:03.180 --> 06:09.960
So let's say here product price that's gonna be your class name then we're gonna have the color again

06:09.960 --> 06:12.390
the color is gonna be the same the primary color.

06:12.390 --> 06:17.750
And when I say the same I thought that I'm going to be placing the white but that's actually primary.

06:17.790 --> 06:22.080
So technically it's not going to be same primary color and that's going to be green.

06:22.200 --> 06:29.280
I would also want to do the same letter spacing and letter spacing that's gonna be our setup and then

06:29.280 --> 06:30.090
what else we have.

06:30.090 --> 06:38.040
I don't know maybe font family just so the text is slanted font family text slant and that should be

06:38.040 --> 06:38.680
it.

06:38.770 --> 06:39.650
This should work.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.220
Now we're gonna have our price.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.180
Okay.

06:43.260 --> 06:48.930
Now let's start working as we're floating everything because at the moment this is not gonna look really

06:48.930 --> 06:51.690
good on a bigger screen and this is not what I want.

06:51.960 --> 06:55.980
I actually need to not open this one not this one.

06:55.980 --> 07:01.990
This is the one that I want to open and uh let's see where we're working this is our recording and I

07:02.150 --> 07:03.900
see the images are really big.

07:03.950 --> 07:06.630
We haven't floated anything so everything is massive.

07:07.080 --> 07:14.520
So why don't we start with our media queries where we can set up the responsive design some say media

07:15.210 --> 07:23.220
screen and mean with starting from some kind of screen size and the screen size I'm gonna start with

07:23.370 --> 07:32.040
is gonna be seven sixty eight pixels and starting from that screen size I would like to first of all

07:32.460 --> 07:38.030
float the product and have it a width of let's say 50 percent.

07:38.130 --> 07:39.180
How is this gonna work.

07:39.690 --> 07:44.910
Well I'm going to say that I'm going to select the product and we're going to use float.

07:45.110 --> 07:45.930
We're gonna float left.

07:45.930 --> 07:48.840
So that's gonna be with all these products that we have here.

07:48.840 --> 07:54.180
All of them are going to be floated to the left and then I also want to have some with and the West

07:54.180 --> 07:55.830
is going to be 50 percent.

07:55.830 --> 07:59.030
And last but not least I would want to keep adding.

07:59.150 --> 08:03.070
Now before I add the padding let me show you what would be the issue and I would want to do that.

08:03.540 --> 08:10.500
So this outlet is not going to be what I want but let's say the moment I get past the 768 out one them

08:10.500 --> 08:11.150
side by side.

08:11.640 --> 08:16.890
But I do want to get some padding in between and that's the reason why for the product I'm gonna have

08:16.920 --> 08:22.400
padding then not only I'm gonna add top and bottom padding which is gonna be to our arms.

08:22.470 --> 08:25.110
Remember that's the same padding we already had.

08:25.110 --> 08:28.350
So the reason for that is because I don't want to override this.

08:28.350 --> 08:31.830
I want to say yeah I want to keep the same padding on here.

08:31.830 --> 08:34.620
Let's write one our aim is gonna be left and right.

08:34.620 --> 08:36.050
So this should fix our issue.

08:36.180 --> 08:38.160
Now we should be having some padding in between.

08:38.730 --> 08:41.520
However the key here is that notice what's happening.

08:41.520 --> 08:48.750
So we have two column land but this column right now does not have this one padding that one RTM left

08:48.750 --> 08:49.410
and right.

08:49.410 --> 08:53.320
And what happens is this one is being pushed out more to the left and to the right.

08:53.370 --> 08:56.140
Now we don't see that on the right of course but we do see it anyway.

08:56.640 --> 09:03.350
So why don't we go back and say from starting also from 768 we will going to have product info and we're

09:03.350 --> 09:04.960
going to add that padding as well.

09:04.980 --> 09:11.670
So I say again not only top and bottom and I will gonna repeat myself but the reason for that is again

09:11.700 --> 09:13.260
we added this planning already.

09:13.260 --> 09:17.520
So I'm just making sure that we're still keeping this and then I'm going to say left and right is also

09:17.520 --> 09:23.570
going to be one RTM and now this is going to look much nicer where we will gonna have them pushed here.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.700
Now with this button and you know what.

09:25.710 --> 09:27.840
Let me make Chuck product in full.

09:28.530 --> 09:35.070
Yeah that's the one where I wanted to add the one I am but obviously this button is gonna be looking

09:35.130 --> 09:38.040
a little bit different because we already have the outline.

09:38.070 --> 09:44.430
So that's not gonna fix everything completely but we are getting into the right right direction where

09:44.430 --> 09:48.290
this is not going to be any more pushed out as far as our image here.

09:48.330 --> 09:49.150
Okay.

09:49.170 --> 09:50.460
What else we would like to do.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
Well let's say as I get to nine hundred ninety two I would want to have three column.

09:56.610 --> 09:59.830
So all of them should be in one line.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.390
How we can do that.

10:01.530 --> 10:06.130
We already know we've just selected copy and paste it.

10:06.420 --> 10:10.040
Then we're going to change in here to nine hundred ninety two.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.770
That's gonna be on land and then we only care about the product.

10:13.770 --> 10:14.930
We already have the float.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.500
We don't care about the float.

10:16.500 --> 10:17.580
We already have the padding.

10:17.580 --> 10:19.030
We don't care about the padding.

10:19.180 --> 10:24.650
And we already set up this product and for now maybe just to test it out maybe let's add product info

10:24.780 --> 10:25.500
to our teams.

10:25.500 --> 10:30.690
Maybe this is going to look better but I can still delete it here and let's say here this is gonna be

10:30.690 --> 10:33.540
thirty three point three percent.

10:33.600 --> 10:38.850
Now once I save it the moment we're gonna get to nine hundred ninety two.

10:38.970 --> 10:45.270
Now we're gonna have this kind of layout where what's gonna happen is that there is gonna be our whatever.

10:45.330 --> 10:51.030
First column and then we're looking with a second column on the second column as I'm gonna have all

10:51.030 --> 10:52.190
three of them here.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.460
One two three.

10:53.460 --> 10:55.640
These are gonna be our three product.

10:55.710 --> 11:02.610
Now finally once I get to a two column layout to a twelve hundred pixels I would want to put them side

11:02.610 --> 11:03.050
by side.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.480
So how this is gonna work.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.750
And I don't think this really helped me a lot.

11:07.380 --> 11:11.260
So I can just say what I am and this is gonna be good enough.

11:11.400 --> 11:18.610
Then here let's add another media query and let's copy paste it and let's say here from twelve hundred.

11:18.840 --> 11:22.050
So starting from twelve hundred what's gonna happen.

11:22.050 --> 11:24.240
Now I would like to work with both of them.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.770
I would work with a product in.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.090
Some would say first of all product info.

11:30.660 --> 11:34.710
And that's always going to be my first column and that's gonna be this dude over here.

11:35.010 --> 11:43.200
And what I would like for this product info is I would like to float it to the left to the left as well

11:43.200 --> 11:48.380
as give it a worth of notes a 30 hour.

11:48.510 --> 11:53.850
So our sorry not our MS 30 percentages.

11:53.910 --> 11:56.210
That's gonna be starting from the top 1.

11:56.340 --> 12:00.390
Now the moment I was get twelve hundred at the moment nothing is gonna happen.

12:00.390 --> 12:04.310
We need to take care of the other dude because for now we haven't done that.

12:04.440 --> 12:08.100
So we have men with but not only I won't work with product info.

12:08.400 --> 12:08.990
And you know what.

12:09.240 --> 12:15.150
I'm having suspicion right now that not for some reason targeting this product and for letting me head

12:15.150 --> 12:21.380
over here and yeah of course there's not product info but I have the product info.

12:21.480 --> 12:27.420
So what would be the better suggestion if I messed it up over here.

12:27.420 --> 12:28.220
Mm hmm.

12:28.230 --> 12:30.390
Let's see what I how I named the other one.

12:30.450 --> 12:33.110
And my apologies I didn't mess this one up.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.070
I have products inventory so you know what.

12:35.250 --> 12:40.540
I might as well go and fix it everywhere where I have products.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.250
Then the same thing is gonna happen over here.

12:43.410 --> 12:46.650
Let me make sure yeah I do have it products in for.

12:46.710 --> 12:47.970
Product product.

12:47.970 --> 12:52.020
That's all good product price product.

12:52.170 --> 12:54.490
And here I need to again product.

12:54.870 --> 12:56.870
And this is also gonna be products.

12:56.880 --> 13:03.600
So as you can see a small mistake one us and it really messes up everything that you're doing.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.850
So now finally everything is looking correct or it should be.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.460
So now we're having the padding.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.670
Now let me make this bigger at the moment.

13:11.670 --> 13:13.330
Again we are not having any floats.

13:13.370 --> 13:14.110
Not great.

13:14.250 --> 13:15.200
We'll figure this one out.

13:15.570 --> 13:19.860
So product info is gonna be float it was left with a width of 30.

13:19.860 --> 13:27.820
However we also have the product inventory copy and paste this product inventory that's right in when

13:28.160 --> 13:30.920
two or three like this.

13:31.050 --> 13:32.730
And we're also going to float it is left.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.840
However here we're gonna give it a 70 percent so we're gonna make this smaller.

13:37.110 --> 13:39.200
So now we're having them side by side.

13:39.300 --> 13:45.240
And what's neat is that nothing is being messed up because we do have right now are clear fixes.

13:45.330 --> 13:47.570
We have a clear fix for the whole column as well.

13:47.570 --> 13:49.170
We have the clear fix here.

13:49.260 --> 13:52.020
So there is no unwanted surprises.

13:52.170 --> 13:55.430
What I do want though maybe a little bit smaller.

13:55.470 --> 14:01.410
I don't know some padding but I would like to change with these guys with these products.

14:01.770 --> 14:08.180
So I'm also gonna say for all the products and the class was the product I'm going to add different

14:08.180 --> 14:15.230
padding of one point five grams and that I'm gonna say one hour am left or right.

14:15.230 --> 14:18.050
And then one is gonna be on the left hand side.

14:18.500 --> 14:23.000
So what I'm doing here is I'm just gonna making this padding smaller because before that we had like

14:23.000 --> 14:27.200
two arms and I just don't see how that would be a better look.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.930
So I'm just gonna go with one point five.

14:29.180 --> 14:35.030
And yeah that's how we can create a nested column layout using the floats and we have right now our

14:35.030 --> 14:36.100
product section.

14:36.140 --> 14:38.510
So now we can move on and start working on our next section.
