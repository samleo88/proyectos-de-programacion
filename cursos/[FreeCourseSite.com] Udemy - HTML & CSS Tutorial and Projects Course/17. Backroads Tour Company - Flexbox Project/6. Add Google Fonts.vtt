00:00.120 --> 00:02.820
We also like to get Google custom fonts.

00:02.910 --> 00:09.600
So let me close up some tabs here and let's open up the Google fonts.

00:09.610 --> 00:10.320
Well that's right.

00:10.320 --> 00:11.730
Google fonts.

00:12.030 --> 00:19.080
Then let's open up the link and then within the Google funds we're looking for two funds we're looking

00:19.080 --> 00:20.180
for later.

00:20.430 --> 00:22.170
And Poppins.

00:22.170 --> 00:30.300
So let me write it later is going to be the first one and then specifically for the year later I'm going

00:30.300 --> 00:33.990
to customize a little bit and get also deal light one.

00:34.080 --> 00:39.150
So like three hundred and regular 400 that should do it.

00:39.300 --> 00:42.550
And then also let's look for Poppins.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.370
Let's look for the Poppins.

00:44.370 --> 00:45.170
Yes.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.810
That's going to be our second font.

00:47.820 --> 00:50.230
We're not going to customize this one at all.

00:50.610 --> 00:55.320
So let's just look for embedding and then I'm going to go with import.

00:55.740 --> 01:03.300
So let's grab this particular import copy and paste it and then what are we going to do.

01:03.300 --> 01:09.270
Well we're going to head over to a style's first and foremost all the way on top.

01:09.270 --> 01:12.270
We are in fact going to copy and paste it.

01:12.270 --> 01:14.580
So now we imported our funds.

01:14.760 --> 01:20.290
And then what I would like to do right now for the body is use both of them.

01:20.460 --> 01:22.250
Just so I can have it right away.

01:22.260 --> 01:24.390
And later on I can just copy paste it.

01:24.510 --> 01:28.020
Now of course we're not going to use both of them for the body.

01:28.080 --> 01:34.600
In fact we're going to use later for all the text and then for the headings we're going to use the Poppins.

01:34.950 --> 01:38.940
But since we haven't set up any kind of rules for headings yet.

01:39.120 --> 01:45.970
Well I'm just gonna go and copy and paste it and as we can clearly see we are using the Poppins.

01:45.970 --> 01:46.440
OK.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.980
When I said later on we're gonna set up everything for the later.

01:50.340 --> 01:57.150
So the whole body is going to have later all the project but then our headings are going to have the

01:57.180 --> 01:58.890
Poppins font family.
