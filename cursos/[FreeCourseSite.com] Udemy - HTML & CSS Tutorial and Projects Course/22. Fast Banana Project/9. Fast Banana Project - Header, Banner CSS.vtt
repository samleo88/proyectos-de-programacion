00:00.040 --> 00:06.810
But before we do that let me quickly show you why we had a flex important to remember here when we had

00:06.840 --> 00:11.590
a flex and we had flex important right and you can see we're here after comment.

00:11.610 --> 00:12.450
Now let's check it out.

00:12.450 --> 00:16.070
What happens if I don't have the important thing so let's say over here.

00:16.080 --> 00:17.400
Now it's not working.

00:17.400 --> 00:21.920
So what's going to happen out here once we refresh All right let's say we're here do we have the links

00:22.210 --> 00:22.590
right.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.480
And now everything is working everything's fine right.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.040
You can see all right.

00:27.270 --> 00:29.850
But what happens is this.

00:29.990 --> 00:30.750
Right.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.570
Once we actually close this one on here see what happens.

00:34.570 --> 00:35.110
All right.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.930
You can see the links actually have disappeared.

00:37.930 --> 00:38.380
All right.

00:38.400 --> 00:38.950
Right.

00:38.970 --> 00:42.070
Because that's the whole thing that we are actually overwriting it.

00:42.090 --> 00:45.600
We're seeing that flex right but it's for short needs to be flex.

00:45.660 --> 00:51.050
Otherwise what's going to happen is again once we're toggling all here with these buttons right now

00:51.060 --> 00:52.880
the links are showing everything is fine.

00:52.890 --> 00:55.340
However you can see how it looks on this screen right.

00:55.350 --> 00:57.900
You can see that it's actually not displaying its flex.

00:57.900 --> 00:58.470
Right.

00:58.560 --> 01:03.300
And if I'm going to go back over here and actually hide the links right there are going to actually

01:03.300 --> 01:04.510
disappear altogether.

01:04.600 --> 01:04.990
Oh.

01:05.090 --> 01:05.940
That's right.

01:05.950 --> 01:09.030
So that's why it's so important over here.

01:09.030 --> 01:11.490
Important I'll say this.

01:11.540 --> 01:13.160
And now everything is working.

01:13.170 --> 01:13.470
All right.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.570
So now there is no problem whatsoever.

01:15.590 --> 01:16.020
Right.

01:16.230 --> 01:18.020
We can toggle up and down.

01:18.350 --> 01:18.640
Right.

01:18.720 --> 01:23.760
And you can see or hear on the links are appearing or if we have it over here right.

01:23.880 --> 01:28.290
The full screen for now but once we keep adding to the screen now we can see what happens.

01:28.290 --> 01:28.890
Right.

01:28.890 --> 01:32.400
So that's why it's so important to have this flex important.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.510
Now let's go ahead and let's start working on here with this.

01:35.940 --> 01:41.720
And you see in a ha moment you have a header here.

01:41.770 --> 01:44.420
It actually has to direct children right.

01:44.640 --> 01:45.460
When it's not.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.980
And the other one is minor.

01:47.040 --> 01:47.700
Right.

01:47.790 --> 01:54.540
And what I'm trying to do is over here is where I want to set it up is that my header is going to be

01:54.840 --> 01:58.090
100 percent you right on here right.

01:58.230 --> 02:01.370
So it's going to be always 100 percent full screen right away.

02:01.710 --> 02:08.010
And then what I would want is actually for this banner to take rest of the space and just leave this

02:08.010 --> 02:09.510
guy whatever he needs.

02:09.510 --> 02:10.030
Right.

02:10.170 --> 02:12.480
So let me show you how we would do this.

02:12.510 --> 02:17.280
So here we're going to go to Maine to assess and we're just going to start a new one.

02:17.290 --> 02:17.630
All right.

02:17.670 --> 02:23.220
And we're going to say that this is going to be a header and a header and I'm going to write a bunch

02:23.220 --> 02:28.320
of hashtags and this and hashtags like this.

02:28.380 --> 02:34.830
Then once we write this this we're going to say that this is going to be at her right here and then

02:34.840 --> 02:38.810
we're going to have a mean height and so we're going to say 100.

02:38.830 --> 02:42.880
You heard like this and then we're going to have it this play.

02:42.920 --> 02:46.350
I'm going to say flex right and you can see what happens right.

02:46.350 --> 02:51.180
Right so now it's actually treating it as a flex direction is a.

02:51.500 --> 02:56.060
Going to change this and we're actually going to say that flex direction is going to be calm.

02:56.220 --> 03:02.580
So we're here I'm going to say flex direction flex direction we're going to say call.

03:02.650 --> 03:03.540
All right.

03:03.540 --> 03:10.050
So now again we have back to call and let me maybe make more space here and now let's start working

03:10.050 --> 03:11.030
with the banner right.

03:11.070 --> 03:19.620
The other direct child of her so I'm going to say hashtag banner here and then I'm going to say flex

03:20.740 --> 03:23.340
flex here we're going to save one.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.950
So grow as much as you need to zero.

03:26.980 --> 03:31.730
Don't shrink and auto check it out with a background so we can see better.

03:31.760 --> 03:32.360
Right.

03:32.500 --> 03:35.610
You can see what happens if I wouldn't have this.

03:35.630 --> 03:37.540
So again let's come on this out.

03:37.540 --> 03:40.360
You can see that it's only going to be spending as much as it actually needs.

03:40.360 --> 03:40.750
Right.

03:40.890 --> 03:41.940
But that's not what we want.

03:41.950 --> 03:42.520
Right.

03:42.580 --> 03:47.580
So one 100 new heights in there or so we don't need to calculate well how much is this and how much

03:47.860 --> 03:49.400
do you read or hear.

03:49.450 --> 03:51.000
We just use flex.

03:51.040 --> 03:51.360
Right.

03:51.460 --> 03:55.590
So it's always going to be growing as much as it needs to now or you can see or hear once.

03:55.900 --> 03:59.520
Now is going to get bigger and it's going to adjust obviously.

03:59.670 --> 04:02.600
But this is very neat because we don't need to think much.

04:02.620 --> 04:06.030
Right now we're going to have a u r l right.

04:06.040 --> 04:11.530
This is going to be background and we're all going to have images and background image.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.760
This is going to be a background image.

04:13.870 --> 04:18.230
Then after that what we would actually want is to have new things right.

04:18.220 --> 04:24.220
So going to say background the attachment here and I'm going to say fixed and the properties and the

04:24.220 --> 04:29.830
values that I'm writing were now we can write on here in a short time so we can basically keep writing

04:29.830 --> 04:31.350
these properties are here.

04:31.460 --> 04:34.450
However there's a reason why I'm doing this.

04:34.450 --> 04:37.350
I just want to show you what each property is and what is the value.

04:37.360 --> 04:37.730
Right.

04:37.900 --> 04:41.830
Because I can just write one long line of code and it's not going to make sense.

04:41.870 --> 04:48.250
Right then I'm going to say background position background I'm going to say position and we're going

04:48.250 --> 04:55.350
to say center like this and Baghran attachment means that this is going to be parallax effect right.

04:55.480 --> 04:59.660
So we're going to be scrolling down as we're going to have more content actually here.

04:59.820 --> 05:00.930
All of this right.

05:01.090 --> 05:03.470
You can see that this is how it's going to look like right.

05:03.480 --> 05:08.560
So now we have all this image and as I started scrolling you can see what happens when Image is fixed

05:08.560 --> 05:10.730
on a back and that text is moving right.

05:10.730 --> 05:12.970
And this would create the parallax effect.

05:13.030 --> 05:17.190
That's where we're using the background attachment fixed here and this is going to be Center.

05:17.230 --> 05:24.070
So replacing the imaging center then we have a background and we'll get the same background over here.

05:24.070 --> 05:30.050
We're going to say cover background size is going to be cover to cover.

05:30.370 --> 05:36.280
And then after that basically we would want a bag on repeat repeat cover means that we would want always

05:36.280 --> 05:39.320
to cover whatever space we have right here.

05:39.340 --> 05:46.180
We're going to see background repeat repeat and repeat like this.

05:46.390 --> 05:49.000
Then we actually would want to work with actual banner.

05:49.030 --> 05:55.350
Right here we treated it as a child here off the flex container.

05:55.360 --> 05:55.780
Right.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.360
Because there was a knife and there was a banner.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.630
Now we're going to make him a parent right.

06:00.670 --> 06:02.820
For you see if this whole text.

06:02.980 --> 06:08.860
So I'm going to say we're hearing this play and I'm going to say flex like this and then we're going

06:08.860 --> 06:10.400
to say justify content.

06:10.570 --> 06:17.230
So horizontally here we're going to say Center and we're going to have a line item items also going

06:17.230 --> 06:18.080
to say something.

06:18.310 --> 06:23.560
Now I want to place it vertically and said I'm going to place it over here and then or here.

06:23.580 --> 06:28.120
The last thing that I would want to do is going to be text a line which you are not going to see right

06:28.120 --> 06:28.690
now.

06:28.850 --> 06:31.120
Right but as this text is going to get bigger.

06:31.120 --> 06:31.670
Right.

06:31.960 --> 06:36.700
This is what's going to place it in the center someone text align center and then you can see that it

06:36.700 --> 06:38.050
moved a little bit.

06:38.260 --> 06:40.820
And this is how it can play in the center.

06:41.050 --> 06:44.620
Now there's one thing that I'm right away going to be doing.

06:44.860 --> 06:51.140
And I want to actually had a black background kind of behind the image.

06:51.180 --> 06:54.000
You can see that it's kind of bright and you can see or hear it.

06:54.010 --> 06:55.930
And we have this dark All right.

06:56.170 --> 06:57.540
So how do we do this.

06:57.610 --> 06:59.500
We do this by linear gradients.

06:59.620 --> 07:06.760
So over here I'm going to place first of all a comment like this and I'm good at linear gradient.

07:07.360 --> 07:11.260
We're here then we would need to write the colors that we would want to do.

07:11.470 --> 07:11.850
Right.

07:12.130 --> 07:19.030
And the colors that I'm going to use is R.G. Hey right and which is going to be red green blue and all.

07:19.110 --> 07:25.570
Here we're going to have opacity was actually going to be a black color like this.

07:25.750 --> 07:29.570
So I'm going to say 0 and let's say five here.

07:29.770 --> 07:30.690
Place another comma.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.280
This is going to be your second color.

07:32.470 --> 07:38.070
And we're going to have zero zero zero in on here let's say five again.

07:38.080 --> 07:38.650
Right.

07:38.830 --> 07:42.240
So we can see that we have a black background here.

07:42.250 --> 07:44.100
This is what changes in the right.

07:44.110 --> 07:49.260
If we have zero point nine you can see this is going to be very dark right.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.850
If you have zero point one is going to be very light.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.160
So I would stick something in between.

07:55.160 --> 08:00.180
We're going to have something along those lines of three an hour here and this is also going to be three.

08:00.220 --> 08:07.190
Then once we are done with a banner Let's go ahead and create banner going to set text right.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.590
This is going to be heading.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.770
And this is going to be text.

08:10.870 --> 08:13.480
Transform transform.

08:13.500 --> 08:18.570
We're going to say uppercase right so this has been I know we would want uppercase then we're going

08:18.570 --> 08:25.230
to have a caller and this is going to be the yellow colors Hogan-Howe hash tag F F C and then we have

08:25.230 --> 08:26.890
9 1 4.

08:27.050 --> 08:30.790
This is going to be a yellow color font size.

08:30.780 --> 08:36.460
We're going to say this is going to be 60 pixels like this font style.

08:36.510 --> 08:39.740
We're going to say this is going to be like here right.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.490
So it's going to be well bleak.

08:41.700 --> 08:45.940
I'm going to have a text decoration instead of removing down the line.

08:45.930 --> 08:48.010
Actually I can have it right.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.920
So if here like this.

08:49.970 --> 08:54.270
And then after that we will want a banner text adding three.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.800
So we're going to go back over here.

08:55.800 --> 09:03.070
We're going to say that this is going to be banner text I'm going to say hitting three you like this.

09:03.070 --> 09:11.880
And again we're going to have a text transform text transform and we're going to say capitalize this

09:11.890 --> 09:12.110
right.

09:12.170 --> 09:18.500
So now each letter starts with a big letter and we have a font size and we're going to say this is going

09:18.500 --> 09:19.850
to be 30 pixels.

09:20.450 --> 09:26.620
Then we're going to have a margin 10 pixels top bottom zero left right.

09:26.930 --> 09:35.360
And then after that we're going to have a color and the color is going to be hash tag D 9 he or here

09:35.720 --> 09:37.980
5 d 6.

09:37.990 --> 09:42.680
Right so we're here and this is going to be our gray gray whitish color.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.490
And then we would want to deal with the links.

09:45.680 --> 09:53.010
So we're going to go Mackall here and we're going to say banner text I'm going to say Hey And first

09:53.010 --> 09:56.990
what I would want to do is I would want to actually add inline block.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.050
And the reason for my blog is I don't want to block right.

10:00.080 --> 10:03.230
I don't want them like they were appearing on here like this.

10:03.230 --> 10:09.420
And so when they have them when you can see it spending all across however I want to have ones we adding

10:09.420 --> 10:12.420
the padding right to that there's actual value here.

10:12.490 --> 10:12.690
Right.

10:12.690 --> 10:15.970
So there's actually some kind of margins in everything.

10:16.080 --> 10:21.210
So I'm going to say we're here in this play and I'm going to say in mine and I'm going to say block

10:22.120 --> 10:25.850
that I'm going to say margin and managers are going to be 10 pixels.

10:26.580 --> 10:31.080
We're going to have a text decoration we're going to say none like this.

10:31.080 --> 10:33.790
Right now we're getting rid of these on the lines.

10:34.140 --> 10:37.190
Then we'll have a text transform again.

10:37.240 --> 10:43.100
Same rights are going to say Truxton's one and we're going to capitalize on this.

10:43.190 --> 10:49.480
We're going to have a font size font size is going to be 25 pixels like this.

10:49.650 --> 10:53.860
And then we have a pairing and pixels like this right.

10:53.880 --> 11:00.690
So planting in between inside over here right then after that we're going to have a color hashtag and

11:01.110 --> 11:09.840
see nine one for like this and then we'll have a border and we're going to have a border of three pixels

11:10.080 --> 11:11.090
solid.

11:11.310 --> 11:15.040
And again we're going to use the color on this is going to be hashtag.

11:15.340 --> 11:16.890
See here.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.530
Nine one for you like this.

11:19.800 --> 11:25.680
And then what you would want to do is over here as I'm hovering I would want the background to change

11:25.680 --> 11:26.260
right.

11:26.270 --> 11:32.200
But for this I'm actually going to have a background and I'm going to say transparent right now around

11:32.700 --> 11:40.190
this and or hear what I would want to do is actually have the same back to transition transition and

11:40.200 --> 11:48.030
I'm going to say color and again background so two seconds is here and back background two seconds these

11:48.780 --> 11:54.940
background also two seconds each one here and then not do however effect.

11:55.110 --> 11:59.930
So I'm going to say Boughner text here.

12:00.780 --> 12:07.340
I will hear what I'm going to do as I'm going to say color and this color is going to be hash tag to

12:07.990 --> 12:10.870
me to hear this.

12:10.970 --> 12:14.300
And this is going to be eight to me here.

12:14.540 --> 12:21.140
Then we say this and what's happening is you can see that I missed her background so it had background

12:21.560 --> 12:27.810
and the background is going to be hashtag FFC the yellow 1 9 1 4 right here.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.790
That's a semi colon.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.710
And let's see what happens.

12:31.760 --> 12:34.460
You can see or hear of a black color.

12:34.470 --> 12:34.990
