WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:03.150
Hopefully your life sir is working properly.

00:03.150 --> 00:07.590
Or you went along with me and installed a preview on your browser right.

00:07.610 --> 00:07.830
What.

00:07.850 --> 00:10.470
That was the name preview on the web server.

00:10.510 --> 00:13.710
That was the name of the extension or you just don't care.

00:13.740 --> 00:19.230
That might be the third option which is also valid in this case since obviously it is more important

00:19.230 --> 00:24.510
for me to show you what's happening maybe in your case you don't care you can just work in your success

00:24.930 --> 00:28.680
and just look at the big browser for all the changes.

00:28.740 --> 00:34.490
Let me just go back to the files again and I'm gonna close the sidebar and we're gonna head over to.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.350
Surprise surprise the stars.

00:36.360 --> 00:36.990
Yes.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.340
Right after these stars.

00:38.340 --> 00:40.170
Yes that's why don't we do this properly.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.600
I'm gonna get rid of this.

00:41.670 --> 00:43.290
We're gonna add some comments.

00:43.290 --> 00:44.560
This is gonna be skills.

00:44.560 --> 00:50.610
Copy and paste not switching the screens just copying pasting and skills.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.550
And here let's start styling this.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.610
So first of all probably let me say this and we'll see that.

00:55.650 --> 00:58.530
This is gonna go back to the normal age to email that we had before.

00:59.070 --> 01:00.850
I can maybe make this bigger.

01:00.930 --> 01:04.790
Might as well because there's still plenty of space for me here.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.180
Let's say first skills.

01:06.180 --> 01:11.450
Now what I would like to do with the skills are I would first want to add the background.

01:11.460 --> 01:12.740
Now what kind of background.

01:12.960 --> 01:18.180
You see that we have this great background and for this we already have the variable so we can target

01:18.210 --> 01:18.690
this.

01:18.720 --> 01:23.290
And I believe that was what I was main Gray.

01:23.310 --> 01:27.970
So now the background for my whole skills section is going to be great.

01:28.020 --> 01:29.610
Mark what else.

01:29.640 --> 01:30.870
Well we have the skill.

01:30.900 --> 01:38.910
Now what was the skill or skill was each and every article that has the icon title and text.

01:39.060 --> 01:41.730
So each and every article has here the class of skill.

01:42.060 --> 01:47.490
What I would want for that particular column or stool might be let's start with pairing zero or I'm

01:47.500 --> 01:48.620
starting at zero.

01:48.720 --> 01:53.160
2.5 our team's top bottom and left and right is gonna be zero.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.050
Now we're having our panic.

01:55.110 --> 01:56.190
Well what else we would like.

01:56.340 --> 01:59.750
Well we can also do text to line maybe in the center.

01:59.900 --> 02:03.890
So now we're gonna line everything in the center and we can also add right away.

02:03.890 --> 02:08.310
Transition what is gonna be transition well later on we're gonna set up the hover effect.

02:08.370 --> 02:13.410
So as I'm hovering I'm going to be changing the color here and since I would want that change to happen

02:13.410 --> 02:14.170
over time.

02:14.370 --> 02:18.200
And since more importantly we have already covered is more than a few times.

02:18.420 --> 02:23.200
So you should be more uncomfortable understanding that I'm writing right now my main transition.

02:23.370 --> 02:27.920
And later on I'm gonna work on that transition because at the moment I was there nothing changes.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.040
We haven't added Our hover effect.

02:30.430 --> 02:31.130
Okay.

02:31.320 --> 02:37.440
Next in line we have skill icon and what I would like to do with the skill icon and first of all let

02:37.440 --> 02:45.660
me head over back to the next century email and show you that I did wrap my skill icon within the span.

02:45.660 --> 02:50.040
However I think I messed it up a little bit where I did not and the class.

02:50.160 --> 02:55.800
So we're not going to be able to select the reason if you're asking well why you are using the span

02:55.800 --> 02:57.560
you're wrapping this and all that.

02:57.660 --> 02:59.700
Well it is a very simple answer.

02:59.700 --> 03:07.590
Remember I was telling you that the moment they switched from four point seventy five they started using

03:07.590 --> 03:11.040
the syntax where you had to have them of course.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.040
Now I showed you that with vandalism.

03:13.170 --> 03:18.240
We can place these classes here or we can select them or you know no sorry we cannot place the classes

03:18.240 --> 03:25.200
here as far as I remember but we can select this we can say let's say this class but I still find it

03:25.560 --> 03:30.030
I don't know by habit I guess I'm adding these classes here to the parent element.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.730
You technically don't have to do it.

03:31.830 --> 03:36.780
You can select this class and apply the same changes and I think everything should be working fine.

03:37.110 --> 03:42.930
But since I have this bad habit as they were or maybe you know not that habit since I have the habit

03:42.930 --> 03:50.340
of as I was applying Phantasm as they were moving from one version to another one I will gonna be using

03:50.340 --> 03:56.400
this parent Whenever I'm working with Phantasm I might switch around somewhere but I think I'm going

03:56.410 --> 03:57.930
to stay like this.

03:57.930 --> 03:58.580
You know what name.

03:58.590 --> 04:04.110
Maybe in a photo I will gonna do it or we're just selecting a class but for now all I'm doing right

04:04.110 --> 04:06.250
now is adding this class to this plan.

04:06.360 --> 04:12.240
There is a parent of my Phantasm so that was number three as well as to this guy.

04:12.250 --> 04:18.120
Otherwise of course I can selected everything in a style C assess and nothing is gonna happen.

04:18.120 --> 04:25.890
What I would like here for this stylized font size is going to be 2.5 hour in so my icon is gonna be

04:25.890 --> 04:29.920
much bigger margin bottom is gonna be one point five.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.870
So I've announced some margin bottom.

04:32.950 --> 04:35.200
Then we also have an option or what.

04:35.200 --> 04:40.210
Well I think we can do to transition because again has I'm going to be hovering I'm going to be lifting

04:40.210 --> 04:40.910
this icon.

04:41.230 --> 04:44.440
However I would want to do it over some period of time.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.430
And that's the reason again why I'm using transition.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.990
Well since we're using the variable and variable is gonna be exactly the same.

04:51.130 --> 04:52.150
You can copy and paste it.

04:52.240 --> 04:57.490
You can just say that both of them are gonna have exactly the same transition last but not least since

04:57.490 --> 05:01.670
I'm using the margin bottom and this is a span.

05:01.900 --> 05:05.940
Previously you noticed probably how I added the margin bottom but nothing changed.

05:05.980 --> 05:09.940
Now just to double check let's see if this is going to be three point five.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.660
Do you think something is going to change or not.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.930
And what is the reason why nothing is changing.

05:15.010 --> 05:23.130
Remember we talked about inline elements block elements in line block and if you remember we were talking

05:23.140 --> 05:28.490
was the span was what Well I think it was the Enlightenment.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.830
So we can add 10 hour EMC or nothing is going to change.

05:32.070 --> 05:39.260
What we need to do is we need to have display and instead of in line we're gonna do inline block now.

05:39.300 --> 05:42.200
So this is gonna add three point five which is not what I want.

05:42.660 --> 05:44.180
So I'll just go in one point five.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.980
So that way we're getting our margin in the bottom.

05:47.040 --> 05:51.810
Also I would like to work on a skill title which is this guy right over here.

05:51.820 --> 06:02.040
Ask Yale to hold that was my class and then I would like to start by phone size zero point nine or Iams.

06:02.160 --> 06:07.240
So the fans are gonna get you guys a little bit smaller than font weight.

06:07.410 --> 06:13.710
We can maybe add our font weight on bold so make them a little bit bolder.

06:14.660 --> 06:15.530
What else we have.

06:15.530 --> 06:20.690
And I believe you know what I was told and save it and second for the headings you're gonna be hearing

06:20.690 --> 06:21.380
the bold anyway.

06:21.380 --> 06:24.140
So in some cases this might be a no work.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.310
But just in case let's add.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.640
Text transform notes do uppercase.

06:29.680 --> 06:34.010
Now this is gonna be uppercase as well as we have the letter spacing.

06:34.130 --> 06:38.260
And for this we have the variable remember where spacing variable.

06:38.270 --> 06:40.410
Now the letters are gonna be spaced out.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.710
You know what we're gonna do the same margin bottom.

06:42.740 --> 06:45.270
So I can copy and paste it here.

06:45.290 --> 06:47.390
Margin of error is going to be one point five.

06:47.570 --> 06:50.180
And I would want to have the color.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.060
Now the color is gonna be primary again.

06:53.060 --> 06:56.830
So primary color and now this is gonna be green.

06:57.050 --> 07:03.460
However again as I'm hovering notice what happens not only I'm changing the background not only I'm

07:03.470 --> 07:08.550
lifting up the icon I'm forcing the changing the color here for the tile.

07:08.570 --> 07:14.620
So what do you think I need to do if we are thinking about it well we want that change but we want it

07:14.620 --> 07:16.160
all the time right.

07:16.300 --> 07:20.640
So don't you think we need to also transition here and this is what's happening.

07:20.680 --> 07:21.790
What is neat.

07:21.790 --> 07:27.160
The fact that we set up this transition and later on you can change that transition if you don't like

07:27.160 --> 07:28.420
zero point three okay.

07:28.450 --> 07:34.140
Granted granted if you want multiple transitions that are let's say different timing and all.

07:34.180 --> 07:36.340
Yeah that's probably not gonna work.

07:36.340 --> 07:41.760
The fact that we're storing here variable but in our case since I know that my transitions are going

07:41.760 --> 07:42.940
to be all the same.

07:43.020 --> 07:48.580
So for all my pay I just want the same transitions I can set this up here as a variable and then I can

07:48.580 --> 07:49.410
just reuse it.

07:49.420 --> 07:52.500
I don't have to retype this annoying all zero point three.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.880
He's an out blah blah blah blah blah blah.

07:54.880 --> 08:03.340
So I think overall the variables really really save are behind because they just allow us to work much

08:03.340 --> 08:07.250
more faster that way if we want to change that transition how it works.

08:07.360 --> 08:12.520
We just need to change it in one place instead of again jumping through the whole our document and then

08:12.520 --> 08:13.360
start changing.

08:13.660 --> 08:18.670
And because think about it at the moment our document is kind of small but it's already.

08:18.670 --> 08:22.880
How many transitions we have no sure thing that on a big page this is gonna be much more.

08:22.930 --> 08:24.450
Well I think it will right.

08:24.700 --> 08:29.820
Anyway long story short we're adding this transition because we will gonna be changing the color and

08:29.860 --> 08:30.920
that would be for the tile.

08:31.600 --> 08:37.670
And last we are having this skill text so I'm gonna say scale text here.

08:37.790 --> 08:39.980
Let's do some line height.

08:40.160 --> 08:42.640
I believe this was 1 point 5 but you know what.

08:42.650 --> 08:46.040
No we already set it up globally anyway it doesn't really matter.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.830
So when we say a line height what else I would like.

08:49.400 --> 08:54.980
Well I'm gonna add a little bit of I'm not font size I think font size is also gonna be good.

08:55.760 --> 09:00.160
Let's also work maybe with max width so that's what I would like to do.

09:00.410 --> 09:05.660
Because at the moment you're probably gonna notice something kind of annoying where this text is gonna

09:05.660 --> 09:10.930
be spanning all across and that's gonna be even worse as we're working with the bigger screen.

09:10.970 --> 09:13.220
Know this is probably not a look that you would want.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.060
So what would be the solution.

09:15.080 --> 09:19.550
What we have here a property called Max with Mm hmm.

09:19.580 --> 09:20.760
Works again.

09:20.900 --> 09:23.680
Main with Max with mean height Max right.

09:23.690 --> 09:25.760
They work in very very similar way.

09:25.790 --> 09:30.680
So what's happening with Max with I'm saying be the with whatever you want to be.

09:31.010 --> 09:33.970
However you will never gonna be bigger does some kind of way.

09:34.310 --> 09:35.270
Now what kind of with.

09:35.300 --> 09:40.630
Well I can pick and choose I can say 10 pixels 20 pixels or two hundred pixels.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.580
Now my guess I'm gonna say 13.

09:42.620 --> 09:43.310
Ari.

09:43.820 --> 09:49.550
Now what happens is I just like how this text looks much better when it's small.

09:49.550 --> 09:54.350
And even though when we were going to be changing later on to column layout and this is going to still

09:54.350 --> 09:56.000
stay exactly the same.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.670
Now the way we're going to work with this though we need to place it down a center.

10:00.110 --> 10:04.650
So at the moment we have the max width so this is not anymore sitting in a center.

10:04.790 --> 10:08.510
Remember the display had multiple things right.

10:08.510 --> 10:14.240
So we had a display element and we couldn't just place it in the center with text center even though

10:14.270 --> 10:15.430
we are adding this.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.090
Let's say for the whole skill.

10:17.210 --> 10:18.950
Now I will digress a little bit.

10:18.950 --> 10:24.540
But anyway what we can do with the black ones we can see margin and remember it was zero.

10:24.540 --> 10:25.300
No.

10:25.330 --> 10:27.370
So now I'm going to place it in the center.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.740
Is there a secret value here for this 13 arms.

10:30.760 --> 10:35.680
No I just I looked at multiple screens and I just kind of came up with this.

10:35.710 --> 10:38.230
There is no real secret or anything about it.

10:38.380 --> 10:42.760
You can say bigger ones if you like your text to be kind of spending more.

10:42.760 --> 10:43.420
You can do that.

10:43.510 --> 10:49.090
I just kind of looked at this whatever title and I decided that in most cases this is just gonna look

10:49.630 --> 10:50.890
decent again.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.460
There's nothing secretive about this right.

10:53.970 --> 10:54.920
All right.

10:54.970 --> 10:59.080
Why don't we start working with these hover effects because at the moment we have been adding a lot

10:59.080 --> 11:04.540
of things but as we're hovering nothing is happening now in my case we're going to say or in our case

11:04.840 --> 11:07.630
I'm sorry we're all working together not just me.

11:07.630 --> 11:12.640
And then when I say has I'm hollering what I would want to do now let's think about it what the rest

11:12.730 --> 11:14.030
has said background first.

11:14.440 --> 11:18.460
So each and every time we're gonna be hovering over this skill article I would like to change the background

11:19.150 --> 11:25.500
what color you can change this to red blue pink whatever.

11:25.540 --> 11:29.290
What I would like to change is drum roll please.

11:29.290 --> 11:33.570
And we're looking for the primary color because that's going to be the color that I'm changing.

11:33.610 --> 11:38.360
So what's happening right now as I'm hovering the changes applied over time.

11:38.470 --> 11:41.390
Again why the changes over time because of the transition.

11:41.400 --> 11:48.850
People transition transition transition you want your hover effects to be nice transition early on.

11:48.970 --> 11:51.350
Let's not transition that transition.

11:51.410 --> 11:51.930
OK.

11:51.940 --> 11:56.650
Long story short we are hovering we're changing the background so far so good.

11:57.370 --> 11:59.350
What else we have.

11:59.500 --> 12:02.330
I believe we were working with the title and the icon.

12:02.470 --> 12:04.750
So how do we make those selections.

12:04.750 --> 12:08.590
Well first of all I'm going to say skill and then we're gonna be hovering.

12:08.590 --> 12:11.030
So we're still gonna be hovering over the skill.

12:11.200 --> 12:11.830
How low.

12:11.830 --> 12:15.310
What I'm saying right now is I'm gonna have the syntax of space.

12:15.310 --> 12:20.350
So there has to be space here and then I'm gonna be targeting again the class that I would like to change

12:20.800 --> 12:27.040
now in my case I'm going to say skill Tyrell is gonna have to change as I'm hovering as well as I'm

12:27.040 --> 12:30.260
gonna copy and paste this I'm not gonna set it up like this.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.050
Not only in the skill title.

12:32.050 --> 12:34.810
Remember we are also changing the skill icon.

12:34.810 --> 12:35.710
Correct.

12:35.710 --> 12:39.360
So we had skill and this is gonna be the icon.

12:39.400 --> 12:45.910
Now what I'm saying right now is as I'm hovering over the skill article something about this needs to

12:45.910 --> 12:48.840
be changed not that something can be anything.

12:48.910 --> 12:54.760
In our case this is just gonna be simply color because we're going to say for the skill titled color

12:54.760 --> 12:58.540
is going to change to green because otherwise you're not going to be able to see the title.

12:59.170 --> 13:00.530
So let's write again.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.370
The main white color right then was color.

13:03.610 --> 13:09.490
And what else we're having now you can copy and paste the color and we're gonna say here and and this

13:09.490 --> 13:10.980
is not going to be main white.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.050
And you know what no my but we're not changing the color.

13:14.050 --> 13:15.880
We're lifting up the icon.

13:15.880 --> 13:23.670
So my apologies we're doing in fact the transform transform and how we can translate it.

13:24.070 --> 13:32.120
Well I already told you we can translate it with a property with translate Y which will gonna be a function.

13:32.320 --> 13:38.170
And I'm just gonna lift it up five pixels and again this might seem a little bit confusing the more

13:38.170 --> 13:42.050
and more you're gonna start using this the more you're gonna understand the more sections we're gonna

13:42.070 --> 13:47.650
cover where what I'm saying is not has I'm hovering over this particular icon what I'm saying as I'm

13:47.650 --> 13:54.540
hovering over the parent container then I want some changes here happening to whatever the title or

13:54.550 --> 13:55.450
the icon.

13:55.470 --> 13:56.280
And let me save it.

13:56.350 --> 13:57.640
And notice what happened.

13:57.640 --> 14:05.430
So two things or I'm not actually three the background changes for the skill the icon is lifted up five

14:05.440 --> 14:11.690
pixels as well as the color and all of them are happening with the not nice transition because we added

14:11.690 --> 14:15.190
the nice transition also what else we're having.

14:15.250 --> 14:21.340
Well you probably are looking at it on a bigger screen and you're like Well I mean it looks good but

14:21.790 --> 14:27.410
I mean I don't think so I would want to have some kind of calm layer that probably would make a lot

14:27.430 --> 14:34.390
more sense and you're right we do need to make a column layout for this one Muslim media so we can be

14:34.390 --> 14:37.370
looking again with the media queries we're going to be working with them.

14:37.510 --> 14:43.190
The syntax was at media screen and then I'm going to say and get rid of this sand.

14:43.780 --> 14:50.230
And now we need to decide starting from what screen size because I mostly like to use men with that

14:50.230 --> 14:55.570
doesn't mean that I exclusively work with men with but a lot of times men with just makes a little bit

14:55.570 --> 14:56.480
more sense.

14:56.530 --> 15:01.870
So when I say men with so starting from what kind of screen and I'm gonna say starting from five hundred

15:01.870 --> 15:08.320
and seventy six pixels so starting from that screen size I would like to work with this skill article

15:08.830 --> 15:14.860
and for each and every article I would like the flow rate restored to the left and add some kind of

15:14.860 --> 15:15.500
way.

15:15.580 --> 15:21.130
Now in this case my with is going to be 50 percent now at the moment we're not going to be able to see

15:21.130 --> 15:25.100
anything because we're less than five so many six hour.

15:25.120 --> 15:25.760
Check this out.

15:26.040 --> 15:32.560
So if I'm gonna make this bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger I have to column layer and

15:32.560 --> 15:40.020
I can also see this in the bigger screen and I have to call and learn more okay.

15:40.090 --> 15:44.440
Why don't we make a four column layout as we get to even bigger screen.

15:45.010 --> 15:48.700
So I think you're gonna be able to see if I work here.

15:48.700 --> 15:55.180
I mean correct me if I'm wrong but I think we can leave this for now just so we can see the columns

15:55.180 --> 15:59.350
and everything and we can have the media query right here.

15:59.380 --> 16:01.110
So what we're doing is that.

16:01.120 --> 16:01.900
Okay.

16:02.050 --> 16:05.150
So we have one media query starting from 576.

16:05.170 --> 16:12.380
How about if we go to twelve hundred instead and then change the with two twenty five.

16:12.430 --> 16:15.140
Now we don't need to add any more this left.

16:15.220 --> 16:18.330
Now the reason for that because we already added this on a smaller screen size.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.690
So what's happening is that this is being already applied.

16:22.700 --> 16:28.220
Now what I can do is I can just get rid of this and I can say that starting from the screen size of

16:28.230 --> 16:32.080
twelve hundred pixels the layout is going to be twenty five.

16:32.710 --> 16:34.760
So this is how it's gonna look like.

16:34.780 --> 16:38.770
Let me serve this properly and we have been successful.

16:38.800 --> 16:42.980
Now we cannot kind of see it here and I don't want to mess up the whole view here.

16:43.120 --> 16:47.290
So I'm just going to leave it here like this or say that we're gonna be working on this screen size

16:47.680 --> 16:53.710
but on a bigger screen size the bigger browser window you can see that I'm having four of them now with

16:53.710 --> 16:54.130
this guy.

16:54.130 --> 16:55.100
I don't really care.

16:55.150 --> 16:57.790
I can mess this up a little bit.

16:57.790 --> 17:03.520
I can say that this is gonna be my let's say past twelve hundred but as I'm making smaller notice the

17:03.520 --> 17:07.920
moment we're gonna get less than 100 we're gonna have to call them later.

17:07.930 --> 17:09.860
Now you can go even more drastic.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.450
This is really up to you.

17:11.510 --> 17:14.620
Understand that you can control whatever columns you want.

17:14.800 --> 17:18.540
You want to set up something here in the middle with let's say 33.

17:18.640 --> 17:19.860
You can obviously do that.

17:20.140 --> 17:25.830
However there is an issue and let me show you the issue so we're gonna head over back to indexation

17:25.830 --> 17:28.980
the amount we're gonna go let's say right for the section.

17:29.170 --> 17:35.530
This is gonna be end of scale section and let's add some random having one and say hey low world the

17:36.100 --> 17:36.840
hello world.

17:36.870 --> 17:37.490
Okay.

17:37.630 --> 17:39.520
So we're having our hello world.

17:39.520 --> 17:44.850
Now let me show you what happens because of the floating has we're actually floating everything.

17:45.160 --> 17:49.900
Now it might be a little bit hard to see you notice how quickly it happened but you will clearly see

17:49.900 --> 17:50.200
this.

17:50.200 --> 17:56.080
If I were going to head over here and the single skill let's just comment it out the last one.

17:56.230 --> 17:59.900
So I'm not deleting this will still going to keep it but for now let's just comment.

18:00.040 --> 18:04.570
Let me save this and let's see what happens is that something you want.

18:04.900 --> 18:06.700
We have the section we have the columns.

18:06.760 --> 18:09.400
What is this dude doing here.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.580
You're not welcome.

18:10.600 --> 18:11.750
We didn't need you.

18:11.980 --> 18:13.180
But what happens.

18:13.180 --> 18:19.900
That's one of the annoying things with loads is you are taking this out of the normal flow.

18:20.050 --> 18:24.000
So you're floating everything to the left so it fits wherever it can fit.

18:24.010 --> 18:29.860
But it even is triggering even as you saw that even when we had four columns it was annoying a little

18:29.860 --> 18:36.010
bit when depending on the screen size it jumped a little bit inside there and you probably want to avoid

18:36.010 --> 18:36.190
that.

18:36.790 --> 18:41.470
Now the way we do that is something called clear fix hack.

18:41.650 --> 18:46.480
This is not really obviously had didn't come up with anything like that but you can write clear fix

18:47.050 --> 18:53.410
hack and maybe add CSX or something like this and they're just gonna basically give you a lot of places

18:53.410 --> 18:56.820
where you can get the hack you don't have to.

18:56.920 --> 19:01.990
Again there is no specific place the way basically this is gonna work is I'm going to show you but just

19:01.990 --> 19:08.290
in case you don't believe me again you can search the online you can find pretty much the same scenario

19:08.730 --> 19:14.740
the way this is gonna work is first of all come on this out and then we're gonna head all back to style

19:14.740 --> 19:19.480
CSI now within the style cirrhosis remember we had some elements right.

19:19.480 --> 19:27.430
So we had these help our utility glasses what I would like to do right now is set up the selector where

19:27.580 --> 19:33.670
as I'm working set up some kind of class and with this class I'm just gonna add some properties and

19:33.680 --> 19:37.430
values that are gonna help me to get rid of this.

19:37.610 --> 19:42.140
Now the way this is gonna work let's say this is gonna be clear fix now there's gonna be a clear fixed

19:42.140 --> 19:45.830
class we haven't added this class in our email yet but we will.

19:46.490 --> 19:50.140
And remember these pseudo elements before and after.

19:50.140 --> 19:58.310
So when we say clear fix after as well as comma clear fix before.

19:58.310 --> 20:04.190
Remember those were the two that placed before and after the content before.

20:04.190 --> 20:09.140
And then we need to light three lines of cotton since we're using the pseudo elements we do need to

20:09.140 --> 20:16.710
use the content is gonna be at least an empty quotation marks we also need to use remember we had wooden

20:16.710 --> 20:22.680
floats we had clear now in my case I would like to use the boat just in case maybe I'm floating something

20:22.680 --> 20:23.570
to the right.

20:23.580 --> 20:29.730
So you're saying clear both and last but not least you would want to use this play and table.

20:29.730 --> 20:33.880
Now again I don't want you to really worry about this cone.

20:33.900 --> 20:38.940
This is something that just being copied and pasted in your projects and what you're doing is you're

20:38.940 --> 20:45.150
getting rid of this fact that as you're floating then the next content is gonna be sticking up where

20:45.150 --> 20:47.280
the original content should be.

20:47.280 --> 20:54.480
So in this case what I can do is I can head over back to indexation IMO and since this skills is where

20:54.480 --> 21:00.180
I'm floating everything I'm just going to have this glass I'm going to say clear fix.

21:00.290 --> 21:01.380
Now I'm gonna save it.

21:01.380 --> 21:03.790
And just to show you that this is gonna work.

21:03.870 --> 21:11.050
Let me again come on this out and as I say it even though we're gonna go to the bigger screen size you'll

21:11.050 --> 21:13.430
see that I have my normal column layout.

21:13.690 --> 21:20.350
So this heading one is not anymore being let's say here side by side because there's not enough space

21:20.350 --> 21:20.920
for the count.

21:21.460 --> 21:26.560
And what we're doing here is we are saying that wherever we're going to be placing this class before

21:26.560 --> 21:27.780
and after.

21:27.830 --> 21:33.010
Would you like to make sure that if we're floating everything here or anything here would you use the

21:33.010 --> 21:36.260
clear both the content whatever and then display table.

21:36.370 --> 21:42.070
Now again this is nothing really you need to lose your sleepover you're going to copy and pasted in

21:42.070 --> 21:46.600
your projects and you're just gonna have to remember it whatever you're going to be floating something.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.320
Make sure that you add that class.

21:48.400 --> 21:53.410
So let's say for the parent element if you're gonna be floating the let's say the skills or anything

21:53.410 --> 21:55.410
like that or any kind of element.

21:55.570 --> 21:59.470
Just add this class and that is gonna solve all your problems.

21:59.530 --> 22:04.180
And yeah I think that we're done with this section and we're ready to move on and start working on our

22:04.180 --> 22:04.750
next section.
