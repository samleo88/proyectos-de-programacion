Remember when we were working with AC says flex box.

00:03.840 --> 00:08.550
In fact when we were setting up the columns we used justified content.

00:08.550 --> 00:13.400
And then in order to have the proper with we used a call function.

00:13.500 --> 00:18.210
Well ladies and gentlemen we don't have to do that anymore.

00:18.210 --> 00:26.490
If we use C is as great because in fact C says grid gives us a very very nice property by the name of

00:26.490 --> 00:27.410
gap.

00:27.780 --> 00:33.090
So let's say we do have our column layout as well as we have of course the rows and I would like to

00:33.090 --> 00:36.290
have some kind of gap in between them.

00:36.300 --> 00:39.500
Well it is as easy as it gets.

00:39.540 --> 00:43.290
I could just say here grid and then we have gap.

00:43.470 --> 00:47.650
And then of course I have either column gap or the road gap.

00:47.700 --> 00:53.100
Now there is also a shorthand by the name of grid gap which we're going to cover in a second but I guess

00:53.130 --> 00:58.860
let's start with a grid column gap and then we just need to specifically say well what kind of gap I

00:58.860 --> 00:59.920
would want.

01:00.090 --> 01:03.780
So I'm going to go with 20 pixels and you go right away.

01:03.780 --> 01:08.760
I have the gap in between my columns with the value of 20 pixels.

01:08.760 --> 01:15.000
So now actually I guess that if I'm going gonna go with grid row gap.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.990
Well I'm going to have this gap in between the rows as well.

01:19.070 --> 01:24.840
Now like I said we also have a shorthand so I could just write a grid gap.

01:24.840 --> 01:31.620
And then if I'm going to add just one value let's say 50 pixels you're going to notice that it is going

01:31.620 --> 01:33.560
to be applied for both of them.

01:33.570 --> 01:40.860
So for the rows as well as the columns and of course I'm doing alright now is I'm just overwriting my

01:40.860 --> 01:44.680
previous values that I had for column as well as the row.

01:44.700 --> 01:51.150
Now we can obviously specifically right here for each of them separately as well where for the great

01:51.180 --> 01:56.760
gap if we just have one value it is being applied for columns as well as the rows.

01:56.880 --> 02:03.900
But if I'm going to write let's say 50 pixels and hundred pixels you're going to notice that higher

02:03.900 --> 02:05.940
pixels is being applied for the column.

02:06.300 --> 02:12.500
So second value is going to be for the column and first one is going to be for the rows.

02:12.510 --> 02:19.440
So this is that we can easily and very fast and in fact the gaps in between the columns and the rows

02:19.860 --> 02:26.700
using one of the properties whether that's great column gap great row gap or the shorthand would be

02:26.760 --> 02:27.750
grid gap.
