WEBVTT

00:00.140 --> 00:05.700
And the first thing that we're going to write here we're going to say team this and then we're going

00:05.700 --> 00:10.290
to say we're here patting again for the pixels like this.

00:10.470 --> 00:18.360
Then after that we're going to have a background and this is going to be hash tag 9 5 9 5 9 5 0 0 0.

00:18.740 --> 00:22.240
And after that we're going to go to the rec team.

00:22.320 --> 00:26.660
Team member member here like this.

00:26.850 --> 00:31.680
And over here we're going to say that team member is also going to have a different background so we're

00:31.680 --> 00:34.130
going to say we're here F5 F5.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.580
So this is going to be a background.

00:36.780 --> 00:38.390
F5 F5.

00:38.490 --> 00:39.990
And we need hash tag.

00:40.230 --> 00:42.090
F5 F5 F5.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.550
And so we're going to have this white background.

00:44.730 --> 00:51.780
Then after that we're going to say margin 20 pixels top bottom zero to the sides like this.

00:51.780 --> 00:55.640
Then after that we're going to have a team member.

00:55.800 --> 01:03.120
We're going to say I am g over here and we're going to see this play lark here and then we're going

01:03.120 --> 01:07.740
to have a with hundred percent 100 percent.

01:08.080 --> 01:12.690
And so now I can see that it's great searching left or right or here or we're going to say that this

01:12.690 --> 01:19.950
is going to have a max height here and this and again we're going to have 300 pixels something like

01:19.950 --> 01:20.830
this.

01:20.860 --> 01:23.960
Then after that we're going to have a image footer.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.490
So now we're talking about this guy over here and we're going to say I am g for.

01:29.730 --> 01:34.220
I don't know what he's going to say first putting 20 pixels in this.

01:34.410 --> 01:39.780
Then we're going to have a display flex and justified content space between.

01:39.780 --> 01:44.130
So basically what I'm saying is I want to move this line all the way to the right.

01:44.220 --> 01:50.190
So I'm going to say we're here just play and I'm going to say flex right now I can see that all of them

01:50.190 --> 01:51.510
are in one line.

01:51.510 --> 01:58.830
But what I would want to actually do I'm going to have a justified content space over here and I'm going

01:58.830 --> 02:07.950
to play say space between some space between here right now actually we would probably need to go back

02:08.400 --> 02:11.250
and figure out why these icons are over here.

02:11.250 --> 02:11.890
Right.

02:11.970 --> 02:17.250
So if we kind of swing back to the next stage now I think we're going to notice one thing right.

02:17.250 --> 02:20.350
So this release image footer right.

02:20.400 --> 02:26.730
We should have a footer info on here and the social icons should be in there right.

02:26.820 --> 02:33.270
So what we're going to do or here is going to cut this one out just as a try right hand or here we're

02:33.270 --> 02:36.540
going to place this still inside this div right.

02:36.630 --> 02:38.880
So this will be the look that we want.

02:39.080 --> 02:45.420
And now wouldn't what we would need to do is I was going to get rid of the social icons on here and

02:45.420 --> 02:47.700
we're actually going to place them all inside.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.330
Right.

02:48.370 --> 02:50.330
So that was my mess up over here.

02:50.340 --> 02:50.870
Right.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.970
I should have actually placed them inside.

02:53.970 --> 02:59.310
So again this is going to be all here with the same social icons on here right.

02:59.310 --> 03:05.130
So for the second one I'm going to delete them and place them on here.

03:05.390 --> 03:05.710
All right.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.530
We're going to have a social icons right.

03:08.580 --> 03:17.130
We're going to have a text and then the last one on him saying so then delete the social icons and copy

03:17.130 --> 03:18.340
and paste them on.

03:18.650 --> 03:21.710
Now that we have them here we can say the next page.

03:21.720 --> 03:28.690
Now go back to the main assess and keep working on here with the heading three.

03:29.010 --> 03:34.710
So we're here what I'm going to say here is that this is going to be a further info.

03:34.720 --> 03:40.880
I'm going to say for info here and I'm going to say heading three.

03:41.110 --> 03:46.190
So now I'm targeting having three I'm going to say color and the color is going to be the blue one.

03:46.190 --> 03:54.240
So I'm going to say hash tag to have be nine or here then this is going to be eight and then we're going

03:54.240 --> 03:55.830
to have zero.

03:55.870 --> 03:56.670
All right.

03:56.910 --> 03:59.550
So now I can see that the color actually turned blue.

03:59.910 --> 04:09.200
Then after that what you would want is actually for reading for heading 5 for in for.

04:09.410 --> 04:19.060
I have on this and then we're going to have a color of hash tag 9 5 9 5 9 5 0 like this.

04:19.200 --> 04:29.600
And then will then have a margin here and margin actually is going to be 10 pixels and 0 10 pixels 0.

04:29.700 --> 04:39.840
And then after that let's do a text transform text transform uppercase like this and I will have a icons

04:39.840 --> 04:40.690
on here.

04:40.770 --> 04:49.630
So we're going to say here and this is going to be so so icons and then we're going to have a fire and

04:49.660 --> 04:56.930
then we're going to say this is going to have a color we're hearing the same 1 9 5 9 5 9 5 0 here and

04:56.930 --> 05:06.650
margin say zero and 5 pixels like this and now go ahead and let's actually style the full Rikon this

05:06.680 --> 05:07.980
guy on the right.

05:08.030 --> 05:17.450
So we're going to say we're here and this is going to be for I can you know in this font here size and

05:17.480 --> 05:22.750
we're going to say 40 pixels on this and I'm going to have a color.

05:22.830 --> 05:24.920
Let's again do the little one.

05:24.920 --> 05:34.680
So this is going to be to be 9 8 and this is going to be 0 like this and we're going to have a opacity

05:35.070 --> 05:37.820
and I'm going to set actually this one to zero.

05:37.820 --> 05:38.040
All right.

05:38.060 --> 05:39.550
But just because we got to work right.

05:39.560 --> 05:40.020
That's right.

05:40.030 --> 05:41.950
We're going to see legist coming this one.

05:42.230 --> 05:45.110
And then we'll know that we always need to uncomment that.

05:45.320 --> 05:51.740
And on here we're going to say a line self I'm going to say Center right now actually place them side

05:51.740 --> 05:58.290
by side in the center or here we're going to say transition and for that transition we're going to have

05:58.380 --> 06:05.240
a transform here two seconds he's going to have opacity.

06:05.380 --> 06:06.050
Right.

06:06.090 --> 06:12.840
Also two seconds is here and now that the actual hover mean.

06:13.030 --> 06:21.650
So let's say over here that we would want a former icon can here we're going to say how we're hearing

06:21.710 --> 06:22.330
this.

06:22.710 --> 06:30.130
And then we're going to say transfer one or here transform and we're going to rotate it and rotate it

06:30.140 --> 06:36.220
is going to be actually 90 negative degrees 90 degrees here.

06:36.600 --> 06:43.830
And then also as we're actually hovering over the actual team right because right now basically when

06:43.830 --> 06:51.630
we settle this right as I'm hovering over this icon this should actually be rotating right and should

06:51.680 --> 06:54.860
be transformed rotate 90 degrees.

06:54.870 --> 06:59.560
So what I'm going to do here you can see first of all I misspelled it for her.

06:59.610 --> 07:01.150
So now if we say this.

07:01.410 --> 07:02.680
See what happens right.

07:02.680 --> 07:08.850
So now it's rotate but I also would want it to actually appear and reappear once I'm hovering over an

07:08.850 --> 07:10.110
actual team member.

07:10.380 --> 07:18.800
So what I'm going to say here is I'm going to say class team member here I'm going to say however that

07:18.810 --> 07:20.170
I'm a floater.

07:20.310 --> 07:27.030
I can write to the class that I'm targeting and I'm going to say personally no one knows and nothing

07:27.030 --> 07:33.390
changes right now because we still have this opacity to zero to go back over here and commandeers right

07:33.920 --> 07:39.360
now what's going to happen is that this capacity you can see I need to place an order here and I can

07:39.360 --> 07:43.690
see it disappears or as I'm hovering over it appears again right.

07:43.970 --> 07:48.840
And as I hover actual icon you can see that it actually shows to the top right.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.580
It rotates 90 degrees.

07:50.820 --> 07:57.230
And now that we're done with this I can actually go ahead and start applying media queries for sponsors

07:57.240 --> 07:57.480
great.
