WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:06.900
Right off 34000 Mark grounds on our agenda is going to be text shadow property as well as block shadow

00:06.900 --> 00:07.470
property.

00:07.560 --> 00:10.470
For this we're going to go first to excess Schimmel.

00:10.620 --> 00:17.560
We're going to set up don't know one headings so let's say main airing and then we're also gonna have

00:17.560 --> 00:18.440
some live.

00:18.700 --> 00:21.980
Now the dave is gonna have a class A BOX OF SIMPLE div.

00:21.970 --> 00:26.710
Class is gonna be box and that's gonna be enough for our email.

00:26.770 --> 00:31.160
And within a C assess let's start styling the first the text.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.160
So this is gonna be hitting one.

00:33.370 --> 00:36.210
Yeah you already see that text shadow property.

00:36.280 --> 00:40.640
I think that's kind of self-explanatory but what values are we looking for.

00:41.140 --> 00:48.040
Well the first value is gonna be X meaning this axis and the second one is gonna be y axis.

00:48.040 --> 00:53.040
Then we're looking for also the blur as well as last one is gonna be color.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.780
There's gonna be much more easier if I show you.

00:55.860 --> 00:58.650
So let's say one pixel one pixel.

00:58.660 --> 01:00.010
So first let's start.

01:00.160 --> 01:00.730
Very easy.

01:00.730 --> 01:03.050
Just by one pixel one pixel.

01:03.370 --> 01:05.430
And we can also do the color.

01:05.890 --> 01:09.550
Now what's happening is you know there's that we are getting the tech shadow.

01:09.610 --> 01:13.530
If I start changing the values you'll notice where the values are changing.

01:13.660 --> 01:19.950
If I'm gonna say five pixels notice right now the direction is gonna be x direction so far so good.

01:20.110 --> 01:22.510
And we can change and also the y direction.

01:22.570 --> 01:26.800
So if I want to change y direction I can set up here to y direction.

01:26.890 --> 01:29.630
You don't want to actually the x direction.

01:29.980 --> 01:31.130
You can write like this.

01:31.210 --> 01:33.400
So again you can delete the pixels.

01:33.400 --> 01:34.480
You can just leave zero.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.900
It's gonna do exactly the same thing.

01:36.940 --> 01:42.520
Now let me leave one on one and the blur isn't going to be the blur of the shadow.

01:42.940 --> 01:43.800
So I can stay.

01:43.840 --> 01:51.640
Let's say one and one but I can make it blurry less blurry more blurry and you get an idea.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.920
Last but not least we have the color again.

01:53.930 --> 01:55.730
Any option under the sun.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.230
You want to go with our Gibby you go with our G.B..

01:58.240 --> 02:03.200
You want to go with our GPA go with our GPA hex whatever you name it.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.670
That would be the tech shadow.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.470
And we also have Boxer for the boxer.

02:07.480 --> 02:13.960
First let's work with our box let's say with is can be two hundred pixels.

02:13.970 --> 02:14.980
That would be a waste.

02:15.000 --> 02:24.250
Then we can also add some light on the pixels background blue margin is going to be let's say 20 pixels

02:24.250 --> 02:25.530
all around.

02:25.720 --> 02:28.210
That's gonna have to be our margin.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.440
And now let's work with our box shadow.

02:30.550 --> 02:36.190
And here with the box shadow we have one extra that would be an optional I'm gonna show you that in

02:36.190 --> 02:39.790
a second but the general idea is gonna be exactly the same.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.860
We have the box at our property.

02:41.860 --> 02:44.510
Again the first one is gonna be for x value.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.310
Then the second one is gonna be for y value.

02:47.380 --> 02:51.670
Then we have the blur and then we're here looking for the green now.

02:51.760 --> 02:56.740
So this is just gonna be the color and what happens is you notice that I'm getting my back shadow as

02:56.740 --> 03:02.230
well as again I can change these values and you'll see exactly the same things like we were doing before

03:02.620 --> 03:07.270
and that is all good but we have also nice external resources.

03:07.270 --> 03:13.900
So first start let's text shadow and generator and we're gonna head over to this site.

03:14.050 --> 03:14.890
Doesn't really matter.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.790
There's a bunch of them you can pick any one you want.

03:17.860 --> 03:19.780
I have no real preference.

03:20.110 --> 03:25.460
Usually the one the first one jumps out and I'm good to go when I say no.

03:25.510 --> 03:31.370
And then you see the example obviously and this would be example text 1 the distance.

03:31.380 --> 03:33.410
Notice this is going to be my distance.

03:33.520 --> 03:37.400
Once the blur is going to be my blur can change the angle.

03:37.480 --> 03:42.130
I mean whatever options you would like and what they would do at the end I was just gonna print you

03:42.130 --> 03:43.270
out the code.

03:43.270 --> 03:45.850
So this would be the code that you are going to be looking for.

03:45.850 --> 03:50.760
You also can choose obviously the opacity that would be with the color name.

03:50.950 --> 03:53.540
And this is gonna give you whatever values you like.

03:53.590 --> 03:57.790
Now in this case if we're gonna be choosing let's say for our G.B. I would want this one.

03:58.180 --> 04:00.080
So that's going to be my red color.

04:00.130 --> 04:06.040
Only thing I would need to do is just copy and paste this code and head over back to my text I will

04:06.040 --> 04:11.680
gonna comment this out the easy one that we had just copy and paste it and now we're gonna have this

04:11.680 --> 04:12.360
texture.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.910
Okay so that will be for text shadow.

04:15.010 --> 04:19.400
We also have an option for box shadow believe it or not generator.

04:19.520 --> 04:24.430
And that meaning sarcastic of course there's gonna be something for the box shut off you're already

04:24.430 --> 04:29.530
using for tech shadow you could imagine that they both of them are gonna have some kind of external

04:29.530 --> 04:31.820
resources and not only some.

04:31.820 --> 04:33.310
There's gonna be a bunch of them.

04:33.400 --> 04:38.590
The reason why I'm showing you right away the box shut up because the result is going to include a browser

04:38.590 --> 04:41.920
prefixes and that is actually a topic of next video.

04:42.130 --> 04:47.740
So I purposely picked right now the text shut on Mark shadow just so we can talk about them because

04:47.750 --> 04:52.850
I remember when we were talking about linear gradients we first time we met them in the colours they

04:52.930 --> 04:55.390
when we were generating the linear gradient.

04:55.390 --> 05:01.520
Well again we're looking at the browser prefixes so I think now it would be good time to talk about.

05:01.570 --> 05:03.880
So here again we're doing the same thing.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.290
We see that there's gonna be some kind of value.

05:06.310 --> 05:12.910
So this is going to be my xbox one horizontal and horizontal and vertical and vertical and lower radius

05:12.970 --> 05:13.760
blur ideas.

05:13.930 --> 05:16.760
And this is that spread where you can kind of spread it over here.

05:16.760 --> 05:18.650
That would be something optional.

05:18.650 --> 05:20.030
Again as you're using.

05:20.390 --> 05:23.580
Remember we have three values so this would be the fourth one again.

05:23.600 --> 05:29.430
If you want to include it included then shadow color the background color I mean you name it.

05:29.660 --> 05:31.940
Really we can pick whatever we would like.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.810
Or here again opacity we can change it.

05:34.230 --> 05:36.200
And the only thing that's missing is over here.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.070
This text.

05:37.280 --> 05:42.410
Now what I would like to do is first of all it refreshed and hopefully this is going to go back to actual

05:42.410 --> 05:48.330
zero and I would like to show you with a hover effect because that would be probably a little bit there.

05:48.380 --> 05:49.460
Example.

05:49.460 --> 05:54.440
So let's say here we're going to be first starting with horizontal length and I'm gonna go with like

05:54.680 --> 05:58.250
five something like this or you're not.

05:58.340 --> 05:59.110
No you know what.

05:59.170 --> 06:05.060
Now let's stay with 10 and then I'm gonna show you the actual how this is gonna work with five.

06:05.060 --> 06:11.000
So let's say I'm going to save this first of all or I'm sorry copy and paste it so grab whatever values

06:11.000 --> 06:13.200
you have over here without changing anything.

06:13.340 --> 06:17.570
I'm gonna head over to the box and we're gonna save for the box.

06:17.690 --> 06:22.730
We need to have actually as I'm hovering something to say as I'm hovering I would like to copy and paste

06:22.730 --> 06:28.190
these tiles and then first of all I'm gonna get out of this one and let's add maybe transition because

06:28.190 --> 06:30.080
this is gonna be a little nicer.

06:30.180 --> 06:33.120
We know how to do that all.

06:33.250 --> 06:37.510
Let's say zero point five seconds and let's settle in here.

06:37.640 --> 06:42.640
Now what's gonna happen is as I'm hovering notice now we're getting our box shadow property.

06:42.650 --> 06:46.920
And now that we have covered box shadow tech shadow we understand the basic idea.

06:47.060 --> 06:49.370
I would like to talk about the browser prefix.
