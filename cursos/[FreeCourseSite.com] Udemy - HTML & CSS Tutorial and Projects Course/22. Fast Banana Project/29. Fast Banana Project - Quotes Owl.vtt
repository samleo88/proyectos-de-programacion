WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:05.250
I'm like I said we're going to be using the Al carrousel cheek where we plug in.

00:05.420 --> 00:07.530
All right so again we go to Google.

00:07.710 --> 00:12.290
We write our curse on them too and we open up.

00:12.340 --> 00:16.530
Whole curso and right away we have multiple things right.

00:16.530 --> 00:19.480
We have home and we have demos.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.270
And then over here we have documentation and don't want.

00:22.470 --> 00:22.780
Right.

00:22.830 --> 00:27.750
And before we dive into documentation Let's do that all right.

00:27.810 --> 00:35.640
So here you can see that I just download the carousel and then we can keep on going and actually let's

00:35.640 --> 00:37.870
see what they would want from us.

00:37.870 --> 00:38.670
All right.

00:38.860 --> 00:40.170
So here.

00:40.170 --> 00:43.310
First things first they're all going to say the installation.

00:43.350 --> 00:44.260
Right.

00:44.340 --> 00:47.170
And these are the things that they require.

00:47.190 --> 00:47.600
Right.

00:47.790 --> 00:53.410
So this is going to be our carousel men and our theme default.

00:53.490 --> 00:57.120
And so those are going to be to see as far as the next one.

00:57.150 --> 01:03.840
Now this one is optional but I highly suggest this because this is right away going to add some styles

01:03.840 --> 01:04.850
by default.

01:05.130 --> 01:06.150
No down at all.

01:06.150 --> 01:10.960
One would be Jake Weary an hour here the actual men.

01:10.990 --> 01:12.240
J.S. Right.

01:12.360 --> 01:15.080
So let's go here to the downloads.

01:15.150 --> 01:18.480
Right now I can see the two of them over here.

01:18.480 --> 01:25.290
I'm just going to open this one up and this and then we're going to go to distribution and we're going

01:25.290 --> 01:26.660
to see where it is.

01:26.760 --> 01:33.610
Right so maybe let's minimize this here let's look where we have a distribution.

01:33.930 --> 01:41.230
And over here we have first of all we have a minge Yes here then with an asset.

01:41.310 --> 01:49.740
We're going to find those out Kairo so mean yes and theme default Mincy assess.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.620
So two of them are here.

01:51.640 --> 01:56.800
So remember this guy and let's grab this guy here.

01:56.910 --> 02:03.490
What I'm going to do is I'm going to create a new folder and I'm going to say let's call it owl right

02:03.510 --> 02:08.780
which is going to stand for our cars and drag all these folders over here.

02:09.210 --> 02:14.620
And what I'm going to do with this folder when I drag it over here to our project.

02:14.630 --> 02:20.090
All right so once we have it we can actually close this one here.

02:20.490 --> 02:28.800
Then we can go back over here and then we can go back to our document here and I can see that I should

02:28.890 --> 02:29.860
someone have.

02:29.870 --> 02:32.550
All right so all of these are here.

02:32.850 --> 02:36.790
So the way we're going to do this go all the way to the top.

02:36.790 --> 02:39.280
And first we're going to have a how.

02:39.460 --> 02:39.750
Yes.

02:39.770 --> 02:40.430
Yes.

02:40.710 --> 02:49.750
So this is going to be a whole oh here and then we'll have a link press time and we're going to say

02:49.750 --> 02:50.540
no.

02:50.920 --> 02:57.790
First of all to start with men CSSA here then orients is going to be all theme.

02:58.140 --> 03:01.920
So whole theme here.

03:02.240 --> 03:09.550
And again this is going to be Lenk press time and we're going to see how all the fault is.

03:09.820 --> 03:11.110
So I will say this.

03:11.180 --> 03:18.970
Now we would want to go to script all the way to the bottom line and let's say after Nahm scroll would

03:18.990 --> 03:27.420
say we're here it's going to be a whole and let's say G-S here and again we're going to have a script

03:28.200 --> 03:29.330
press time.

03:29.670 --> 03:32.730
It's going to be source for the source.

03:32.730 --> 03:39.750
What we would want is a whole wall here and the source.

03:39.930 --> 03:41.140
So see our.

03:41.310 --> 03:41.800
Yes.

03:41.840 --> 03:47.600
Or you doing this now for our what we would want is default.

03:47.670 --> 03:48.590
What I mean.

03:48.720 --> 03:49.530
Yes.

03:49.540 --> 03:50.100
All right.

03:50.170 --> 03:57.170
And then we would need a custom write custom model or we can actually go ahead and add in our script

03:57.180 --> 03:57.690
form.

03:57.810 --> 03:59.740
Right it really doesn't matter right.

03:59.760 --> 04:04.520
The last one that we had covered was progress bar so maybe we can do it over here.

04:04.650 --> 04:15.510
You say we're here and this is going to be all curso just maybe delete some of these comments here select

04:15.560 --> 04:19.440
the whole thing right and let's do the beard.

04:19.490 --> 04:21.070
All right so here we start on here.

04:21.080 --> 04:27.320
This was the first one that he created this was for a toggle button and then this was for the scroll

04:27.320 --> 04:33.690
tab then smooth scrolling and then accordion and then on here this was our progress box right.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.210
So now it's work with our covers.

04:36.740 --> 04:39.520
And what would they want for the Alcaraz first.

04:39.530 --> 04:40.250
All right.

04:40.250 --> 04:45.970
So say this more here and let's go back now.

04:46.130 --> 04:49.900
First what they're saying is setting up the HDMI.

04:49.990 --> 04:50.610
Right.

04:50.690 --> 04:57.830
And you can see here we have a div basically with the class of our carousel and then on here these are

04:57.830 --> 05:00.310
going to be children right so we have one parent one child.

05:00.590 --> 05:04.480
So where we have this in our document it's all going to go back over here.

05:04.970 --> 05:10.520
And sure enough you can see or hear when we had quotes center I remember we had our curso And we also

05:10.520 --> 05:11.670
had our theme.

05:11.850 --> 05:12.150
Right.

05:12.170 --> 05:14.210
And again this is just for styling right.

05:14.210 --> 05:15.600
So this is optional.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.550
We still had it.

05:16.550 --> 05:21.570
But the point is we have a div and then we had three articles.

05:21.810 --> 05:23.660
And so we had one to three articles.

05:23.660 --> 05:24.860
Those are the children.

05:25.100 --> 05:27.480
So those are the divas in this case.

05:27.490 --> 05:28.200
Right.

05:28.580 --> 05:31.130
Then over here if we would want right.

05:31.130 --> 05:36.770
The simplest way is actually just to have a document ready function which we already have and then we'll

05:36.770 --> 05:38.720
just set our curso our cards.

05:38.720 --> 05:39.920
All right.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.810
So here you can see that we're obviously calling this class.

05:43.000 --> 05:43.570
Right.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.710
So that's the one that we were interested in.

05:45.710 --> 05:51.400
So if you're going to be using a different class right then obviously this is going to be different.

05:51.400 --> 05:57.280
But for now since we're using our curso and also all we can do with this.

05:57.950 --> 06:02.690
Now we're not going to do the most simplest right example.

06:02.700 --> 06:06.000
We're all going to do right away you can see that we have demos right.

06:06.140 --> 06:10.590
And you can see let's say here we have basic responsive and on here this is going to be Center.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.780
So let's start with a basic one right because what's going to happen you can see right away it shows

06:14.780 --> 06:15.490
what we're going to how.

06:15.530 --> 06:15.780
Right.

06:15.820 --> 06:20.290
So this is going to look that we're going to have an hour here you can see that everything is already

06:20.490 --> 06:21.120
right.

06:21.170 --> 06:25.470
So loop is true margin turn right now.

06:25.490 --> 06:27.520
True responsive or.

06:27.690 --> 06:34.130
And if you're wondering where you're getting this right here we can go back documentation right then

06:34.130 --> 06:36.760
over here you can see that this is going to be infinity loops center.

06:36.950 --> 06:40.160
So those are the options that you can actually work with.

06:40.160 --> 06:40.550
All right.

06:40.700 --> 06:46.930
So if we go back to options or you're right and you can see one by one right items where default history

06:47.230 --> 06:47.580
right.

06:47.630 --> 06:53.600
But here you're working with an object so it has three margin 0 right.

06:53.690 --> 07:00.150
However for that basic one already stuff was set up where we were going to add some of our own right.

07:00.230 --> 07:03.450
And I'm just showing you we're all getting getting them from right now.

07:03.460 --> 07:09.710
I'm going to go one by one right and actually show you what they do because again that's completely

07:09.710 --> 07:11.900
totally separate tutorial.

07:11.900 --> 07:19.090
However let's say Now Fred will be using now what you have over here is now of Boullion.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.710
You can see by default is false.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.890
So we are obviously going to make it true and that's how we're going to get it now.

07:24.350 --> 07:29.950
So now I showed you where to get the docs right and I got it all going to go back to them.

07:30.030 --> 07:31.530
This is going to be our basic point.

07:31.690 --> 07:32.230
Right.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.550
The only thing is right away you can just copy and paste this right.

07:35.570 --> 07:39.180
And there's really no rocket science right.

07:39.230 --> 07:41.430
So we can just copy and paste this here right away.

07:41.430 --> 07:43.420
Get a basic one on.

07:43.580 --> 07:45.920
It's always easy after that the customized.

07:45.970 --> 07:46.210
Right.

07:46.220 --> 07:47.420
And this is what I suggest.

07:47.450 --> 07:54.500
Always in the beginning once you start working with something right it's really easier to actually have

07:54.500 --> 07:56.110
a look at how they have done it.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.090
Start making your own changes.

07:58.340 --> 08:02.220
And believe me that's when you're actually going to learn how everything is set up right.

08:02.300 --> 08:07.030
Because in the beginning you might do a lot of type of mistakes that are unnecessary right because I

08:07.050 --> 08:10.410
read all documentation and everything is set up for us right.

08:10.660 --> 08:13.800
Here we have a loop true margin 10.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.330
Not true at all here responses.

08:16.490 --> 08:24.860
Now what I would want to add is smart speed and that's going to be the amount of time is actually loading

08:25.400 --> 08:25.680
right.

08:25.700 --> 08:31.940
Again I got this in documentation and the way I'm doing this I'm going to say smart I'm going to say

08:31.940 --> 08:36.650
speed here we're going to set it equal to let's say two seconds.

08:36.740 --> 08:40.920
And so this is going to be how long it takes for the actual slide to go through.

08:40.960 --> 08:41.420
Right.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.150
Smarts beat 2000.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.630
And then over here you can see the response right.

08:45.770 --> 08:52.790
Well basically this is saying is how many items would be on the screen of when we have 600 when we have

08:52.790 --> 08:55.060
all your thousand and whatever like five.

08:55.070 --> 08:55.630
Right.

08:55.940 --> 09:00.720
And in general I'm going to change just one right so this is going to be one.

09:00.950 --> 09:04.250
But maybe for now let's just let's just keep it the way it is right.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.060
Just so we can see what's happening.

09:06.110 --> 09:07.760
I'm just explaining what this does.

09:07.800 --> 09:13.390
And this just tells you with the screen size how many items you are going to.

09:13.660 --> 09:18.570
So let's say this right here right away you can see that this is what will all right.

09:18.610 --> 09:20.200
And let's go to the bigger screen.

09:20.210 --> 09:21.690
It's going to look better.

09:22.060 --> 09:22.470
All right.

09:22.560 --> 09:27.270
We're going to refresh here and now we can see that I have five of them right.

09:27.370 --> 09:28.990
Because that was the value over here.

09:28.990 --> 09:29.470
Right.

09:29.650 --> 09:33.270
And since you can see that it's basically repeating them right.

09:33.310 --> 09:35.790
So now basically we have five of them.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.200
Now what are we going to do here.

09:38.230 --> 09:43.640
Like I said we're going to change it to 1 because I would just want it to be sliding on every screen.

09:43.640 --> 09:48.480
I would just wanted to be one right one on zero 610000.

09:48.760 --> 09:52.240
And I'm just going to keep these responses just in case I change my mind.

09:52.240 --> 09:52.490
All right.

09:52.490 --> 09:56.140
So again I would say this here to refresh.

09:56.570 --> 10:02.680
And sure enough right now we have a massive one right here like this.

10:02.680 --> 10:08.410
But you can see what's happening right now is that we're going to have to work hollowbody with this

10:08.590 --> 10:09.880
image right.

10:09.940 --> 10:12.180
So it's not as I said we're here right.

10:12.310 --> 10:17.040
But what we're mostly concerned over here is this Button's right.

10:17.050 --> 10:22.600
We're going to also change them but you can see that we have a working carrousel right away.

10:22.660 --> 10:29.600
Now let's go ahead and let's actually get rid of all here these big screen right.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.080
Because this is not what we want.

10:31.080 --> 10:37.740
We wouldn't want this whole thing all the time to be let's say hundred in something like this right.

10:37.780 --> 10:39.630
To be stretching like this image.

10:39.770 --> 10:41.380
So we're going to go to Maine.

10:41.460 --> 10:44.370
When when when and where is image going to go.

10:44.390 --> 10:46.390
And we're going to say important right.

10:46.390 --> 10:54.370
So not only we're selling it right one time 100 pixels but we're just overriding the default from the

10:54.370 --> 10:56.260
actual Our Carrousel.

10:56.320 --> 11:02.250
So again if we're going to refresh now I can see that obviously now we can control it however you want.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.540
Now I would say this is a little bit better looking.

11:04.540 --> 11:05.260
Right.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.740
And the smart speed.

11:06.950 --> 11:08.770
And we had it over here in the script.

11:08.850 --> 11:09.520
Right.

11:09.550 --> 11:12.280
This is like I said how long it takes.

11:12.280 --> 11:17.400
All right so you can see that now it's sliding like two seconds and obviously the default value would

11:17.400 --> 11:23.770
be a little bit less because I always like my animations will take longer time so you can see you actually

11:23.770 --> 11:25.540
see what that they're happening.

11:25.990 --> 11:30.800
And now what I'm interested over here is you see these buttons you can actually style them right.

11:30.820 --> 11:34.110
It's not it's not set in stone how they look like.

11:34.210 --> 11:36.400
So maybe we would do that.

11:36.500 --> 11:41.640
So we're going to do a little bit of customization you see or hear this theme right.

11:41.860 --> 11:46.960
That's the one that's actually making these buttons so if you're not going to include this class or

11:46.960 --> 11:49.380
here right now you're not going to see them.

11:49.420 --> 11:55.030
And trust me I've done this mistake in the beginning a lot where I did couldn't find the buttons because

11:55.030 --> 11:57.120
I wasn't including the whole thing.

11:57.340 --> 12:02.950
So if you want the button to include the whole thing then or here let's go back over here like I said

12:02.950 --> 12:04.790
to our theme default.

12:04.800 --> 12:05.380
Right.

12:05.380 --> 12:06.280
It is a man.

12:06.310 --> 12:11.820
So going to save it here with the beautifier can get it like this.

12:11.820 --> 12:14.720
Let me order for now I can see everything appears.

12:15.010 --> 12:18.040
Now one by one all theme all night.

12:18.150 --> 12:19.010
All right.

12:19.120 --> 12:23.740
And we see you all here at the call right and you can see brackets right away highlights where we actually

12:23.740 --> 12:24.860
work.

12:24.910 --> 12:29.060
So Caller Well what would be the caller didn't we run.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.750
What do we want first of all a background right.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.950
We would probably want the yellow one right.

12:33.950 --> 12:35.580
So 9 1 4.

12:35.650 --> 12:42.520
All right then let's say as we're actually hovering right what we would want right.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.840
So as we hovering was just the color that we want.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.040
Probably not.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.640
All right so we're going to go back over here.

12:48.640 --> 12:52.370
Let's let's get our blue on blue.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.760
Where is our moon here.

12:55.680 --> 13:00.000
Right and we're just going to copy this we're going to go back over here.

13:00.150 --> 13:06.140
We're going to say as we're hovering right we're going to have this color Now let's say for the color

13:06.140 --> 13:10.950
or is going to keep black 1 1 9 1 9 1 9.

13:11.370 --> 13:15.990
And also for the same same for this 1 9 9 1 9 9.

13:15.980 --> 13:20.310
So this is going to be in black color but if you want you can actually change it right now so you can

13:20.310 --> 13:21.500
do it over here.

13:21.570 --> 13:26.670
Also once we have worked with these ones let's work here with these little dots.

13:26.670 --> 13:27.290
All right.

13:27.390 --> 13:33.930
We're going to scroll it down here and you can see or hear right as we're hovering what should happen

13:33.930 --> 13:34.710
right now.

13:34.770 --> 13:37.710
Let's use the little one right.

13:37.710 --> 13:47.080
So this is going to be one when we're holding this copy and we're going to go back over here right now

13:47.090 --> 13:53.130
this is going to be blue as we're actually going on here this is going to be simple background.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.780
See 9:24 right.

13:55.870 --> 14:01.940
So only when the actual image or hear them is going to be blue and or here are going to be all right.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.070
Now I can see how easy it is.

14:04.240 --> 14:04.630
All right.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.730
How fast we can actually work with a.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.250
All right.

14:09.280 --> 14:13.120
And set it up right now this is going to be our old carousel.

14:13.120 --> 14:13.800
Right.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.630
Just going to be responsive basically.

14:15.640 --> 14:16.410
Right.

14:16.510 --> 14:21.440
And there's obviously more customization we can do we can actually get rid of these dots altogether.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.060
We can move these over here somewhere right.

14:24.070 --> 14:26.170
We can change what is inside.

14:26.170 --> 14:28.510
Over here we can actually place phantasm.

14:28.840 --> 14:34.630
And actually my bootstrap course I have this how we are actually customizing this right.

14:34.770 --> 14:38.770
But for now we're just going to leave it the way it is because we're mostly focusing on fluxbox but

14:39.280 --> 14:43.190
you can see that you're not limited to fluxbox and see a grid.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.480
All right.

14:44.560 --> 14:51.430
There are options how you can actually customize a lot of things right by using Jake plug plugins.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.010
I can hear you if you can see that.

14:53.020 --> 14:54.920
Obviously this was the basic online.

14:55.240 --> 14:59.240
But if we go back to demos there's many options.

14:59.340 --> 15:06.370
This is not the only one and for all of them it's very easy to just go right away see the documentation

15:06.370 --> 15:06.660
right.

15:06.670 --> 15:11.140
First of all they show you the look and this is going to be the look that you can get the center image

15:11.340 --> 15:11.970
here.

15:12.350 --> 15:14.520
And over here you can see that this is going to be.

15:14.540 --> 15:17.920
Since this is an object right of center true.

15:18.130 --> 15:25.240
And again like I said in the beginning I would suggest that just copying pasting is changing the values.

15:25.240 --> 15:26.770
Understanding how it works.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.240
Right.

15:27.340 --> 15:31.600
Because that limits your mistakes because if you make one mistake and let's say you're targeting the

15:31.600 --> 15:37.240
wrong class or or anything like this I mean a lot of things can happen as you were adding this order

15:37.240 --> 15:38.290
here.

15:38.510 --> 15:39.880
Jake replugging right.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.990
And you're limiting those mistakes by actually going with the default options.

15:44.100 --> 15:49.030
That would be my suggestion to you not just because you know I don't want to retype everything every

15:49.030 --> 15:49.810
time right.

15:49.930 --> 15:52.420
But it's also because it limits your own mistakes.

15:52.420 --> 15:58.050
Right now you're ready to move on to our last section of this vast panel of project.
