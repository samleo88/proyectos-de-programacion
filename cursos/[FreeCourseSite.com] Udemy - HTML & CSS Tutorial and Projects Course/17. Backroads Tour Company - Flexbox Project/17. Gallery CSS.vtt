00:02.120 --> 00:11.840
Through audio we know that are going to head over to style C assess and copy and paste it like so.

00:11.860 --> 00:18.210
Then again I'm going to change these values around and we're going to say not featured.

00:18.530 --> 00:25.930
But of course the name is gallery to cursors gallery and then within the comments why don't we first

00:26.020 --> 00:30.440
add some kind of background gallery background.

00:30.580 --> 00:37.790
I'm gonna shoot for dark gray so dark gray is going to be my background car.

00:38.390 --> 00:39.810
That I would like to place.

00:39.820 --> 00:44.460
In fact my little icon in the center of the image.

00:44.500 --> 00:48.460
And again we do have our container the image container.

00:48.460 --> 00:55.960
So why don't we write gallery image container is going to be position relative just so we can place

00:55.960 --> 01:00.990
the icon all the way in the center as well as we're gonna add some background color.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.640
Now the reason why I'm adding the background color because as we're going to hover over this particular

01:06.640 --> 01:13.070
item in fact what is going to happen we're going to have this primary color known as a maverick.

01:13.150 --> 01:20.110
We have this light green color and that's the reason why we set this up as a background.

01:20.110 --> 01:22.940
And we see this as a primary color.

01:22.960 --> 01:30.010
Now currently we're only going to be able to see this in the bottom no move later on we're gonna do

01:30.010 --> 01:38.400
some magic with an image and that's the reason why there's going to be this light green color now first

01:38.400 --> 01:41.160
of all why don't we place it in the center.

01:41.160 --> 01:48.990
So let's read gallery icon and let's use position position absolute.

01:49.550 --> 01:52.610
Now of course now an icon is just hidden.

01:52.610 --> 02:03.650
But what we would like to do is set it as top 50 per cent then so that's it left 50 percent.

02:03.650 --> 02:05.420
And let's see what would be the result.

02:06.110 --> 02:10.720
So it is probably hard to see but that is in fact our icon.

02:10.760 --> 02:13.770
Now first of all why do we increase the font size.

02:13.870 --> 02:15.740
And I'm going gonna go with two point.

02:15.740 --> 02:18.310
I don't know if five rhythms.

02:18.470 --> 02:24.800
So our icon is quite big but we can clearly see that the icon is in fact not sitting in the center.

02:24.800 --> 02:30.630
Now in order to fix that we would need to in fact use the transform property.

02:30.860 --> 02:34.200
So let's use transform property with a translate.

02:34.220 --> 02:39.490
So I'd like to translate my icon 50 percent off its own width and height.

02:39.920 --> 02:46.890
And when we set the first one minus 50 percent in this case the icon is going to move left.

02:46.920 --> 02:55.010
Mind if we sit at minus 50 percent to a top while it's going to move 50 percent of the top let's say

02:55.070 --> 02:55.890
it.

02:56.000 --> 02:56.930
There you go.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.800
Icon is sitting in the center.

02:58.850 --> 03:01.470
Now also let's add some color.

03:01.940 --> 03:05.720
Main white thing that is going to be appropriate.

03:05.740 --> 03:06.070
Yes.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.430
That is our icon.

03:07.430 --> 03:12.140
Why don't we also add cursor pointer on like so.

03:12.350 --> 03:15.260
And then what else what else what else.

03:15.260 --> 03:22.130
Well I would like to show this icon as I'm hovering correct but I would want to show it over some period

03:22.130 --> 03:22.720
of time.

03:22.790 --> 03:24.970
So I'm gonna use my transition.

03:25.160 --> 03:30.190
Let's use transition var and main transition.

03:30.200 --> 03:30.970
All right.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.800
Now lastly I would like to hide it by default.

03:34.160 --> 03:36.590
So as the page loads it's gonna be hidden.

03:36.590 --> 03:45.230
That's the reason why I have a policy of zero and only when we're going to hover in fact over our container

03:45.620 --> 03:48.230
then I'm going to show my icon.

03:48.260 --> 03:52.830
Now first things first as far as gallery image.

03:53.030 --> 03:57.660
Remember we had not only image container but also gallery image.

03:57.680 --> 04:04.320
So what I would like to do is change the opacity when I'm hovering over the particular container.

04:04.340 --> 04:04.950
All right.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.360
So first of all let's say for the gallery image I'm going to use as well the transition because I don't

04:10.360 --> 04:13.500
want that change to happen over time.

04:13.730 --> 04:22.430
So let's have transition as main transition and then let's set up two rules one for the gallery image

04:22.730 --> 04:25.210
and the second one for the gallery icon.

04:25.250 --> 04:27.110
So let's start with gallery image.

04:27.110 --> 04:33.950
So as I'm hovering over the container so gallery hyphen image hyphen container as we're hovering over

04:33.950 --> 04:34.130
it.

04:34.700 --> 04:40.550
While I would like to target gallery image and I would like to change the opacity I would like to change

04:40.550 --> 04:42.140
the capacity to zero point five.

04:42.590 --> 04:49.010
And that's the reason why previously we set up this transition because I would want to have this opacity

04:49.460 --> 04:51.630
to in fact change over time.

04:51.830 --> 04:56.600
And we also notice something interesting where now we can see our color.

04:56.630 --> 05:02.300
Remember when we set up our background color initially we were not able to see color but now we are

05:02.300 --> 05:05.920
able to see because the opacity on image changes.

05:05.990 --> 05:10.280
So if let's say I'm going to change this color to let's say red.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.690
And of course I'm going to remove it.

05:11.690 --> 05:15.950
But just to give you an idea then of course you're going to have this kind of background.

05:16.310 --> 05:17.100
OK.

05:17.420 --> 05:21.250
Now let's in fact say that we have our first thing.

05:21.410 --> 05:23.200
The opacity of image changes.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.820
But now let's show in fact our icon.

05:25.820 --> 05:29.810
So what I'm gonna do right now is I'm going to copy and paste this rule.

05:29.810 --> 05:31.260
I'm going to leave the image container.

05:31.270 --> 05:38.420
However the same but we're going to target the icon instead and for the icon I'm going to change the

05:38.420 --> 05:44.520
opacity 2 1 so as we're hovering not as my icon right now shows up.

05:44.970 --> 05:45.650
OK.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.590
That was that.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.120
Now probably let's set up our column layout.

05:51.440 --> 06:07.740
So again media some media screen and men with mean with and we're gonna set this up as 7 68 pixels like

06:07.780 --> 06:08.630
so.

06:08.650 --> 06:19.210
And remember we had gallery center gallery center and I would like to set this gallery as a two column

06:19.210 --> 06:19.720
layout.

06:19.720 --> 06:23.580
So first of all let's use display looks.

06:23.890 --> 06:29.950
And when we use flex wrap right away again we already have covered why we're doing that.

06:29.950 --> 06:35.560
So let me use flex wrap and then let's start out on a bigger screen size.

06:35.560 --> 06:40.440
So that's something how our current section is going to look like.

06:40.930 --> 06:42.070
So we have flex.

06:42.070 --> 06:42.710
Yes.

06:42.880 --> 06:47.500
That is nice but there's of course a few things we wouldn't want to change.

06:47.560 --> 06:55.870
And in this case our container our Flex box child is in fact this gallery image container because let's

06:55.870 --> 06:56.470
think about it.

06:56.470 --> 07:04.510
So we have gallery center and then we have multiple children that are in fact having this single item

07:04.510 --> 07:05.260
comment.

07:05.440 --> 07:13.240
And what I would like to do right now is in fact set them up as a 50 percent of the layout so let's

07:13.240 --> 07:24.660
target the gallery hyphen image can Taner and let's do again flex 0 0.

07:24.890 --> 07:31.400
So our item is not going to grow or item is not going to shrink and 50 percent of the width now in this

07:31.400 --> 07:36.560
case the man going to set up the calc function because while I don't want any margins if you want the

07:36.560 --> 07:38.640
margins of course you can do it that way.

07:38.720 --> 07:39.790
I don't need any margin.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.560
So that's the reason why I have this two column layout.

07:42.980 --> 07:50.570
And then lastly let's do the same thing where once we get to the bigger screen size to let's say nine

07:50.570 --> 07:57.320
hundred ninety two we're gonna change these values so I don't care about gallery center everything is

07:57.320 --> 07:58.340
going to stay the same.

07:58.340 --> 08:05.750
So I don't need to change it and then I'm gonna say that instead of 50 percent I'm gonna have a four

08:05.750 --> 08:08.880
column layout and that's the reason why I'm using 25 percent.

08:09.410 --> 08:16.070
Now one thing that I would like to mention again all my images though are the same size not the reason

08:16.070 --> 08:19.530
why you don't have any weird layout issues.

08:20.090 --> 08:23.960
And just to pinpoint that let's head over to our backroads.

08:24.260 --> 08:31.000
Let's head over to my images and you're going to notice that if we select all the images and I'm going

08:31.010 --> 08:40.460
to zoom in here open with previous default then I'm going to I'm going to zoom out select all of them.

08:41.050 --> 08:47.620
In order to select all of them again we're just using commander if we're head over to adjust size all

08:47.620 --> 08:49.570
of them are going to be the same size.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.030
So I used a hundred by let's say 450.

08:53.050 --> 08:59.110
But you can use it wherever you like but as far as you do that then you're not going to have any weird

08:59.110 --> 09:03.350
layout issues where let's say one image is gonna be bigger or smaller.

09:03.350 --> 09:04.210
And there you go.

09:04.210 --> 09:09.220
We have our four column layout now in my opinion.

09:09.220 --> 09:16.180
Again it is my preference but I don't like to shove things like card has a four column map in my opinion

09:16.180 --> 09:22.000
the cards look very small and that's not the look that I'm going for of course you can always change

09:22.300 --> 09:24.820
the previous layout to a four column layout as well.

09:25.220 --> 09:25.800
All right.

09:25.950 --> 09:30.270
That wouldn't be an issue I just don't like the fact that cards are extremely small.

09:30.430 --> 09:36.310
But I just wanted to show that of course we can also have a four column layout the same how we can have

09:36.310 --> 09:43.330
three column layout and two column loud and just like that we're done with our gallery section and we're

09:43.330 --> 09:44.950
ready to move on to our next section.
