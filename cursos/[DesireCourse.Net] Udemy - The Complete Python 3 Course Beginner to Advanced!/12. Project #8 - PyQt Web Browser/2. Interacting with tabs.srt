1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,629
Alright guys, welcome back. What we're

2

00:00:03,629  -->  00:00:05,339
going to get to now is just playing

3

00:00:05,339  -->  00:00:07,379
around with the tab bar itself and I'm

4

00:00:07,379  -->  00:00:09,150
going to show you guys how we can do

5

00:00:09,150  -->  00:00:11,490
different stuff with it, because this is

6

00:00:11,490  -->  00:00:13,950
going to be essential for going through

7

00:00:13,950  -->  00:00:16,350
the rest of this video. We're going to be

8

00:00:16,350  -->  00:00:19,500
using this tab bar and there are certain

9

00:00:19,500  -->  00:00:21,150
things you can do with it, and this is

10

00:00:21,150  -->  00:00:22,350
actually going to lead right into the

11

00:00:22,350  -->  00:00:23,820
next video where we're going to talk about

12

00:00:23,820  -->  00:00:29,519
custom window events. So at the bar here, if I put my

13

00:00:29,519  -->  00:00:30,840
application here, you'll notice that

14

00:00:30,840  -->  00:00:34,320
there's tabs, they're static, I gotta shut

15

00:00:34,320  -->  00:00:37,649
down my PyCharm on my other machine I guess.

16

00:00:37,649  -->  00:00:43,770
Alright, so, yeah those tabs are static, you

17

00:00:43,770  -->  00:00:45,629
can't really do anything to them, so what we

18

00:00:45,629  -->  00:00:47,850
can do is set some arguments when we

19

00:00:47,850  -->  00:00:50,640
create the tab bar here. So the two

20

00:00:50,640  -->  00:00:52,170
that we're going to be talking about are

21

00:00:52,170  -->  00:00:55,590
movable and closable. So the two

22

00:00:55,590  -->  00:00:57,449
arguments we need to pass in are movable

23

00:00:57,449  -->  00:01:07,320
equals true, and tabsClosable equals

24

00:01:07,320  -->  00:01:11,159
True. I'm going to save this and rerun our

25

00:01:11,159  -->  00:01:13,770
application, and you're going to see that

26

00:01:13,770  -->  00:01:17,369
now I've got these clothes icons and we

27

00:01:17,369  -->  00:01:24,840
also can rotate the tabs I guess. So,

28

00:01:24,840  -->  00:01:29,340
what you need to do you in order to

29

00:01:29,340  -->  00:01:33,360
close the tab here is you

30

00:01:33,360  -->  00:01:35,640
need to hook into an event, so signals

31

00:01:35,640  -->  00:01:37,650
and slots. So what we're going to do is

32

00:01:37,650  -->  00:01:40,590
we're going to connect tab close requested to our

33

00:01:40,590  -->  00:01:42,450
custom method that will actually remove

34

00:01:42,450  -->  00:01:45,659
the current tab. So what we need to do is

35

00:01:45,659  -->  00:01:53,280
go self.tabbar.tabCloseRequested, and

36

00:01:53,280  -->  00:01:55,140
this is a signal so you don't put

37

00:01:55,140  -->  00:01:56,460
parentheses or anything,

38

00:01:56,460  -->  00:02:00,719
.connect and we're going to connect

39

00:02:00,719  -->  00:02:06,320
it to self.CloseTab.

40

00:02:06,590  -->  00:02:09,440
I'm going to drop down here and I'm

41

00:02:09,440  -->  00:02:12,769
going to define close tab, and this

42

00:02:12,769  -->  00:02:16,370
takes in a parameter, I believe, we will

43

00:02:16,370  -->  00:02:18,349
see in a moment. Maybe this isn't the one that

44

00:02:18,349  -->  00:02:20,360
takes a parameter. Let me just print

45

00:02:20,360  -->  00:02:23,900
out i and let's see if it does automatically send

46

00:02:23,900  -->  00:02:27,470
the index of the current tab, or

47

00:02:27,470  -->  00:02:35,000
the tab that has requested to close, and

48

00:02:35,000  -->  00:02:39,170
it doesm cool. So, yeah, this connection

49

00:02:39,170  -->  00:02:41,390
here automatically sends the tab that

50

00:02:41,390  -->  00:02:43,280
should be closed, and then all we're

51

00:02:43,280  -->  00:02:48,200
going to do is we're going to self.tabbar.

52

00:02:48,200  -->  00:03:06,470
removeTab, alright.

53

00:03:06,470  -->  00:03:09,170
Then pass in the index number of the tab you want to remove.

54

00:03:09,170  -->  00:03:12,889
You want to save it, run the application

55

00:03:12,889  -->  00:03:19,370
again, and there for some reason base size

56

00:03:19,370  -->  00:03:25,489
come in there which is so strange.

57

00:03:25,489  -->  00:03:32,810
Oh, let me create the app and then set

58

00:03:32,810  -->  00:03:35,299
the base size, I think that's the problem,

59

00:03:35,299  -->  00:03:39,049
there we go. So now when we close the tab

60

00:03:39,049  -->  00:03:43,459
it actually closes. For some reason the window

61

00:03:43,459  -->  00:03:46,970
there is jumping, I am not really sure why, we will figure

62

00:03:46,970  -->  00:03:47,569
that out.

63

00:03:47,569  -->  00:03:53,720
So, we can move the tabs, and close

64

00:03:53,720  -->  00:03:56,690
the tabs, and we're also going to need a

65

00:03:56,690  -->  00:03:59,329
way to add tabs, so what we're going to

66

00:03:59,329  -->  00:04:02,569
do is we're going to create a window

67

00:04:02,569  -->  00:04:06,169
border that we're going to add the tabs

68

00:04:06,169  -->  00:04:10,790
to, and we're also going to add the close

69

00:04:10,790  -->  00:04:13,010
button for the window. So this is going

70

00:04:13,010  -->  00:04:16,760
to be a custom window border, it's not

71

00:04:16,760  -->  00:04:18,709
going to have the native one, because we

72

00:04:18,709  -->  00:04:19,450
don't want that we want

73

00:04:19,450  -->  00:04:21,790
our window, our web browser, to have

74

00:04:21,790  -->  00:04:30,430
tabs at the top. So, to explain that a bit

75

00:04:30,430  -->  00:04:33,760
better what I'm going to do is we're

76

00:04:33,760  -->  00:04:37,870
going to add widgets to the main

77

00:04:37,870  -->  00:04:39,670
interface, so down here where we add

78

00:04:39,670  -->  00:04:43,150
stuff to the layout, which again is a QVBoxLayout,

79

00:04:43,150  -->  00:04:46,420
we're actually going to add first an address bar,

80

00:04:46,420  -->  00:04:50,620
and then we're going to add the stacked

81

00:04:50,620  -->  00:04:53,290
layout itself. So what we need to do for

82

00:04:53,290  -->  00:04:55,060
the address for is we're actually going

83

00:04:55,060  -->  00:04:57,340
to subclass that because we're going to

84

00:04:57,340  -->  00:05:02,650
when you add a tab or when you press on a tab,

85

00:05:02,650  -->  00:05:04,870
or when you press on the address bar,

86

00:05:04,870  -->  00:05:06,940
it's going to automatically select all

87

00:05:06,940  -->  00:05:08,800
of the content from within the address

88

00:05:08,800  -->  00:05:14,800
bar. So class AddressBar is going to

89

00:05:14,800  -->  00:05:20,080
inherit from QLineEdit, then we're going to

90

00:05:20,080  -->  00:05:22,900
define init which is basically just

91

00:05:22,900  -->  00:05:28,690
going to say super init, and then we're

92

00:05:28,690  -->  00:05:34,780
going to define mousePressEvent, and so

93

00:05:34,780  -->  00:05:37,510
basically if you want to modify events

94

00:05:37,510  -->  00:05:42,370
for a widget or a class that comes

95

00:05:42,370  -->  00:05:45,460
packaged with Qt, what you need to do

96

00:05:45,460  -->  00:05:48,190
is you need a subclass it and then create a

97

00:05:48,190  -->  00:05:50,620
method called what the event is called,

98

00:05:50,620  -->  00:05:52,690
and then you can do whatever you want.

99

00:05:52,690  -->  00:05:54,430
So we're going to say self, which is

100

00:05:54,430  -->  00:05:56,500
the line edit, and we're going to say select

101

00:05:56,500  -->  00:06:00,430
all. So that's the only reason we're really

102

00:06:00,430  -->  00:06:03,040
subclassing that. So what we're going

103

00:06:03,040  -->  00:06:04,390
to do is we're going to create the

104

00:06:04,390  -->  00:06:08,830
address bar here, so I'm going to add

105

00:06:08,830  -->  00:06:10,960
some comments here just to keep things

106

00:06:10,960  -->  00:06:13,770
organized.

107

00:06:18,050  -->  00:06:24,740
I'm going to say self.addressbar

108

00:06:24,740  -->  00:06:29,780
equals AddressBar. And now what we're

109

00:06:29,780  -->  00:06:31,190
going to do is we're going to add the

110

00:06:31,190  -->  00:06:34,310
tab bar first, then the address bar, and

111

00:06:34,310  -->  00:06:35,870
actually what we're going to do is we're

112

00:06:35,870  -->  00:06:39,379
going to create a QHBoxLayout. So,

113

00:06:39,379  -->  00:06:42,020
let's go ahead and create, what we need

114

00:06:42,020  -->  00:06:47,990
to do first okay is add a H, we need to

115

00:06:47,990  -->  00:06:50,300
add a widget, and then add the HBox

116

00:06:50,300  -->  00:06:52,129
Layout to the widget, and then add the

117

00:06:52,129  -->  00:06:53,509
address bar because we're also going to

118

00:06:53,509  -->  00:06:55,159
be adding buttons like back and forward

119

00:06:55,159  -->  00:06:57,919
buttons, so you guys will see what I mean

120

00:06:57,919  -->  00:07:04,039
here. So self.Toolbar equals QWidget,

121

00:07:04,039  -->  00:07:17,240
and then self.ToolbarLayout is going to equal

122

00:07:17,240  -->  00:07:21,379
QHBoxLayout, and now what we can do is we

123

00:07:21,379  -->  00:07:25,310
can add layout,

124

00:07:25,310  -->  00:07:29,029
well we're going to set toolbars layout

125

00:07:29,029  -->  00:07:34,490
to this toolbar layout. So self.Toolbar,

126

00:07:34,490  -->  00:07:42,020
yeah that's right, setLayout, and it's

127

00:07:42,020  -->  00:07:46,400
going to set to self.ToolbarLayout.

128

00:07:46,400  -->  00:07:50,479
Now we're going to add our address bar

129

00:07:50,479  -->  00:07:55,520
to the toolbar layout. So self.ToolbarLayout.

130

00:07:55,520  -->  00:07:59,060
addWidget, we're going to add a self.address

131

00:07:59,060  -->  00:07:59,659
bar/

132

00:07:59,659  -->  00:08:04,849
Okay, so, now we've got our toolbar widget

133

00:08:04,849  -->  00:08:07,370
that we can then throw into

134

00:08:07,370  -->  00:08:09,770
the main layout under the tabbar. So self

135

00:08:09,770  -->  00:08:10,490
.layout.

136

00:08:10,490  -->  00:08:13,190
addWidget, and we're going to

137

00:08:13,190  -->  00:08:20,449
add self.Toolbar. I'm going to save this and run

138

00:08:20,449  -->  00:08:23,240
the application again, and now you're

139

00:08:23,240  -->  00:08:28,889
going to see that...

140

00:08:28,889  -->  00:08:34,769
...

141

00:08:34,769  -->  00:08:39,469
...

142

00:08:41,010  -->  00:08:45,450
Alright, so, let's go ahead and try that

143

00:08:45,450  -->  00:08:47,660
again,

144

00:08:50,790  -->  00:08:54,180
there. So if I click you see that it

145

00:08:54,180  -->  00:08:56,970
selects all which is what we did when we

146

00:08:56,970  -->  00:09:04,560
subclassed the QLineEdit there. Now

147

00:09:04,560  -->  00:09:06,839
things still don't look right because

148

00:09:06,839  -->  00:09:10,769
there's a lot of space in here,

149

00:09:10,769  -->  00:09:12,720
so what we need to do is we actually

150

00:09:12,720  -->  00:09:17,790
need to set the spacing to 0, and the contents

151

00:09:17,790  -->  00:09:20,699
margin. So we're going to say self.

152

00:09:20,699  -->  00:09:28,769
layout. setSpacing going to be 0, going to

153

00:09:28,769  -->  00:09:33,630
refresh, and we're going to see that some spacing has

154

00:09:33,630  -->  00:09:38,010
been removed, and then self.layout.

155

00:09:38,010  -->  00:09:44,940
setContentsMargins(0, 0, 0, 0) and this is one for

156

00:09:44,940  -->  00:09:49,079
each side. Now this has removed more

157

00:09:49,079  -->  00:09:50,880
margin as you see there.

158

00:09:50,880  -->  00:09:59,160
So, what we need to do at this point, so

159

00:09:59,160  -->  00:10:01,709
we've got our address bar, we've got our

160

00:10:01,709  -->  00:10:06,390
tab bar, but what we're going to do is

161

00:10:06,390  -->  00:10:08,279
we're going to create a custom window,

162

00:10:08,279  -->  00:10:10,680
and we're going to be doing that

163

00:10:10,680  -->  00:10:14,029
actually in the next video.
