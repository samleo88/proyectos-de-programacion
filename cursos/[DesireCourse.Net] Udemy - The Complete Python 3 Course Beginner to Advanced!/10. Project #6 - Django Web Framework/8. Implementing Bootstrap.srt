00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,619
Hey guys, welcome back. So if we run our

2

00:00:03,629  -->  00:00:08,870
django project here, and we open up

3

00:00:08,880  -->  00:00:15,410
Safari and go to localhost port 8000, this

4

00:00:15,420  -->  00:00:18,529
is a terrible looking site. So what we're

5

00:00:18,539  -->  00:00:21,500
going to be doing is integrating django

6

00:00:21,510  -->  00:00:26,210
with bootstrap. So, what we need to do

7

00:00:26,220  -->  00:00:29,870
is go ahead and open a terminal here and

8

00:00:29,880  -->  00:00:34,940
type "pip3 install django-bootstrap3"

9

00:00:34,950  -->  00:00:41,360
and it should install

10

00:00:41,370  -->  00:00:43,670
bootstrap in there. So what we need to do

11

00:00:43,680  -->  00:00:46,400
now is we need to go into our project

12

00:00:46,410  -->  00:00:50,029
into settings, and we need to find the

13

00:00:50,039  -->  00:00:56,150
installed apps section, which is way up

14

00:00:56,160  -->  00:00:59,090
here, and what we need to add is

15

00:00:59,100  -->  00:01:06,080
'bootstrap3' So

16

00:01:06,090  -->  00:01:08,719
in order for bootstrap to work we

17

00:01:08,729  -->  00:01:10,399
actually need to include it into the

18

00:01:10,409  -->  00:01:12,350
template files, so in this case I'm

19

00:01:12,360  -->  00:01:14,179
looking at the index page so what I'm going

20

00:01:14,189  -->  00:01:17,870
to do at the very top of the index page

21

00:01:17,880  -->  00:01:18,530
here

22

00:01:18,540  -->  00:01:22,010
you just need to load bootstrap 3. So

23

00:01:22,020  -->  00:01:25,429
we're going to put this in the command

24

00:01:25,439  -->  00:01:27,890
type, remember there's different kinds of

25

00:01:27,900  -->  00:01:30,350
curly braces to use this is used for

26

00:01:30,360  -->  00:01:33,080
blocks of codes or commands, and this is

27

00:01:33,090  -->  00:01:35,870
used to print out variables and

28

00:01:35,880  -->  00:01:38,420
whatnot. So we're using this type here

29

00:01:38,430  -->  00:01:43,460
the kind with the with the percent

30

00:01:43,470  -->  00:01:45,950
symbol, and we're just going to type

31

00:01:45,960  -->  00:01:52,429
"{% load bootstrap3 %}" So let's go ahead and open up

32

00:01:52,439  -->  00:01:55,819
another tag and we need to type

33

00:01:55,829  -->  00:02:03,830
"{% bootstrap_css %}" and then "{% bootstrap_javascript %}"

34

00:02:05,860  -->  00:02:09,270
and so basically what load bootstrap 3

35

00:02:09,280  -->  00:02:12,450
does is it loads these tags that you can

36

00:02:12,460  -->  00:02:17,520
use within your template. So what we're

37

00:02:17,530  -->  00:02:23,430
going to do is let's save this, let's refresh

38

00:02:23,440  -->  00:02:27,150
the app, and now you'll see that we do

39

00:02:27,160  -->  00:02:30,360
have a working bootstrap. So that's how

40

00:02:30,370  -->  00:02:32,190
to make our site a little prettier.

41

00:02:32,200  -->  00:02:33,870
I'm gonna be styling this before the

42

00:02:33,880  -->  00:02:35,460
next video so you guys feel free to do

43

00:02:35,470  -->  00:02:36,990
the same if you want, I just don't want

44

00:02:37,000  -->  00:02:45,450
to work with such a terribly simple site.
