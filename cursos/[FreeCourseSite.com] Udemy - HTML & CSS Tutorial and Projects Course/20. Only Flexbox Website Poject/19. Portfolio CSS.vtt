WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:08.410
And the first thing in the C Ss we're going to say this is going to be hash tag poort we know this and

00:08.530 --> 00:13.680
we're going to say padding 40 pixels like this all around.

00:13.690 --> 00:15.140
And I have a background.

00:15.210 --> 00:18.830
And this is going to be hash tag see 1999.

00:19.010 --> 00:20.280
Here is a great one.

00:20.510 --> 00:23.670
And then I'm going to right away away got this work I'm right.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.740
So remember this was the whole article.

00:26.100 --> 00:27.840
So here I'm going to say work.

00:28.290 --> 00:34.900
And then first we're going to say position route and the position relative was actually for this overlay.

00:34.920 --> 00:35.280
Right.

00:35.280 --> 00:41.190
So in order to get this effect right we need position relative for the whole box.

00:41.190 --> 00:46.680
And then over here Disney I mean the one that's actually disappearing and appearing right this is going

00:46.680 --> 00:47.850
to be absolutely right.

00:47.850 --> 00:51.220
So just remember that then we all have position.

00:51.310 --> 00:52.740
We're here for the whole world.

00:53.190 --> 01:00.120
Then for the whole thing is going to say grown linear gradient and that's going to create this effect

01:00.150 --> 01:04.410
that as we're hovering right there is going to be dark more here effect.

01:04.670 --> 01:13.440
Some the r g b c this is going to be 0 0 0 here and not let's say 7.

01:13.530 --> 01:15.170
It's almost black.

01:15.320 --> 01:21.300
Another one are G-B a 0 0 0 0 point seven here.

01:21.390 --> 01:21.960
Right.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.010
So now can see what happens right.

01:24.030 --> 01:28.090
So this is going to be on the back right of the image.

01:28.310 --> 01:34.340
And right now we're going to do is we are going to send this one on like this and we're here to say

01:34.360 --> 01:40.580
for the actual work we're going to say max height and let's leave it at 300 pixels.

01:40.670 --> 01:43.480
Right so this shouldn't be more than 300 pixels.

01:43.480 --> 01:48.840
We're here to say more were going to say radius and we're going to save five pixels.

01:49.060 --> 01:55.000
That's for around the edges and maybe actually look more than 10.

01:55.410 --> 02:03.350
Then after that or here we're going to have a margin and we're going to say 10 pixels and zero willingness.

02:03.690 --> 02:07.050
And then the last thing is going to be over here a overflow.

02:07.050 --> 02:07.660
Hidden.

02:07.830 --> 02:12.680
But again we're going to write it here overflow and over here here.

02:12.870 --> 02:18.240
And again this is going to be for the actual text text when it's actually going to be appearing from

02:18.240 --> 02:19.260
the bottom right.

02:19.290 --> 02:22.640
So make a comment that this is going to be Image overlay.

02:22.770 --> 02:27.830
Just so you remember why we're actually doing this because obviously right now nothing changes.

02:27.870 --> 02:33.480
If we had an image of it then or here we would want to start working with an image some of them say

02:33.480 --> 02:42.720
port folio and I'm going to say image or here I'm going to have display block like this first then I'm

02:42.720 --> 02:48.580
going to say with and without one actually 100 percent to see what happened.

02:48.570 --> 02:54.540
I'm basically the image right now is going to be 100 percent and then again you are going to have a

02:54.540 --> 03:00.980
max height and are going to say 300 pixels 300 pixels on this.

03:01.160 --> 03:06.540
And then after that we would want a cursor and we're going to say pointer's So as we're actually hovering

03:06.690 --> 03:12.670
around the image right this would be cursor pointer and then we're going to say we're here a passerby

03:13.560 --> 03:20.940
and we're going to set it equal to one and then we'll have a transition or transition transition we're

03:20.940 --> 03:29.130
going to say this is going to be a opacity and we're all going to say two seconds is this and then let's

03:29.130 --> 03:31.090
go to hovering effect.

03:31.130 --> 03:40.210
So I'm going to support forwell image here hover in or here what we would have is very simple.

03:40.260 --> 03:44.960
We're going to say opacity zero point four as we're actually hovering.

03:44.990 --> 03:45.420
All right.

03:45.420 --> 03:51.010
So this is what happens right now I can see that they are passing the changes or the text.

03:51.600 --> 03:58.890
However Greg you can see that as the opacity changes the background comes into play.

03:59.080 --> 04:03.790
Or here we can actually do a maybe a little bit different it.

04:03.930 --> 04:09.950
So instead of max height here right we can try it out what will happen with men.

04:10.020 --> 04:16.200
Men height all here and now you can see that it totally goes over the actual image.

04:16.200 --> 04:16.650
Right.

04:16.830 --> 04:21.550
So this is how we can actually change it from men height let's say over here right.

04:21.570 --> 04:25.850
So now we're saying this is actually going to be 300 pixels right.

04:26.070 --> 04:29.370
And this over here is now going to be more than 300 pixels.

04:29.430 --> 04:36.390
Now we're here to go back all here and you can see that if I don't have this over head and had you can

04:36.390 --> 04:40.070
see this this little text be peeking out right.

04:40.170 --> 04:45.410
But if we actually come on this right now you can see that it actually disappeared.

04:45.810 --> 04:50.430
Now after that what we would want to do is we would want to actually going to start working with this

04:50.520 --> 04:54.070
image overlay and how this would actually work.

04:54.180 --> 04:54.770
Right.

04:54.780 --> 05:02.190
So here what I'm going to say first is I'm going to say is MCCLYMONT class image we're like this.

05:02.420 --> 05:06.070
And remember when we had position relative over here right.

05:06.260 --> 05:11.420
This is going to be position and this is going to be absolute like this.

05:11.520 --> 05:18.500
You going to have a bottom here and we're going to say we're here zero and you know what let's go back

05:18.500 --> 05:20.860
over here and I can see where it is right.

05:20.900 --> 05:23.270
So now we have an absolute right.

05:23.390 --> 05:26.690
But now we place it all the way or here at the bottom.

05:26.690 --> 05:34.530
And what we want to do is now we would want a left or so 0 say left and left.

05:34.700 --> 05:42.020
We're going to say zero here but now we need to put some mark on and on here the same thing right now

05:42.030 --> 05:47.430
is do a with of 100 percent with.

05:47.450 --> 05:51.040
We're here with Hundred percent.

05:51.200 --> 05:56.600
And then over here we're going to have is a height of hundred pixels on here like this.

05:56.600 --> 05:57.030
Right.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.310
So we made this whole thing hundred pixels high.

06:00.320 --> 06:00.880
All right.

06:00.890 --> 06:02.870
So you can see or hear this line.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.660
This is your 100 pixels.

06:04.850 --> 06:08.730
And again it's an arbitrary value you can use whatever you want.

06:08.780 --> 06:10.960
Actually you're your.

06:11.390 --> 06:17.460
And the next thing that we would want to do is actually have a margin bottom of negative hand.

06:17.490 --> 06:19.680
Right so basically that's push down.

06:19.700 --> 06:25.460
So I'm going to see or hear margin bottom and I'm going to say negative hundred pixels right.

06:25.490 --> 06:29.560
And obviously the way it works is if the height over here is a hundred pixels right.

06:29.570 --> 06:31.980
What I'm doing here is pushing it all the way down.

06:32.090 --> 06:38.930
And again if I go back over here and come and this more flow here in right you can see where is this

06:38.930 --> 06:39.640
guy right.

06:39.830 --> 06:45.800
So I push it down but if the old hit is not set and actually would actually still be shown.

06:45.880 --> 06:46.220
Right.

06:46.340 --> 06:52.640
So therefore we're using or hit it and let's leave it for now just so we can see what we're.

06:52.670 --> 06:54.750
What other things we're having right.

06:54.930 --> 06:59.540
Otherwise if I'm going to hide it right you're not going to be able to see and I get and we can do two

06:59.540 --> 07:00.610
ways right.

07:00.650 --> 07:04.950
We can actually uncommon this one with maybe not not have the margin yet right.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.240
So let's go here to margin bottom let's uncommon this one right.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.820
You can see where we still have this thing right.

07:11.860 --> 07:14.990
And what we're going to have is we're going to use a flex property.

07:15.110 --> 07:17.640
So we're going to say we're here first of all.

07:18.070 --> 07:22.240
First of all this play and we're going to say flex on here.

07:22.370 --> 07:24.710
Right and I can see that side by side.

07:24.830 --> 07:31.700
Then we're going to have a justified content space on here between then we are going to have a a line

07:32.380 --> 07:37.840
and we're here we're going to say a line items Santror because I want to place them both in the middle.

07:38.410 --> 07:38.960
This.

07:39.200 --> 07:48.020
Then after that we would want is actually a padding zero top bottom but 20 pixels on the sides.

07:48.330 --> 07:51.860
So here now I can see that we actually push them on each side.

07:52.130 --> 07:54.740
And then after that we would want a background.

07:55.040 --> 08:04.610
And again really your choice of color what would you want is 1 4 7 1 4 7 1 4 7.

08:05.450 --> 08:10.740
Right so the gray one or here and then what we want is actually transition right.

08:10.730 --> 08:16.820
So I'm going to say on here transition and we're going to transition margin I'm going to see margin

08:17.290 --> 08:21.060
two seconds ease on here he's right.

08:21.290 --> 08:28.430
And what's going to happen over here is obviously read knowledge's do the margin bottom line let's actually

08:28.430 --> 08:30.260
common this out.

08:30.350 --> 08:30.700
Right.

08:30.740 --> 08:33.170
And I can see that we have a modern bottom.

08:33.290 --> 08:35.930
If I said on here you can see now this disappears.

08:36.140 --> 08:43.180
However if we're going to go back to more cover I'm going to say work over here.

08:43.190 --> 08:51.740
When I say image overlay over here I'm going to say margin bottom zero real like this.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.850
So now this is only had to happen as I'm hovering right.

08:55.070 --> 09:00.290
So as you can see as I'm hovering You can see the first of all the background changes and or here it

09:00.290 --> 09:04.450
appears right and the same or the same or.

09:04.830 --> 09:05.210
Right.

09:05.210 --> 09:10.140
And if we go over here right this should also work the same or here.

09:10.250 --> 09:18.620
Now the next thing we want to do is actually work with these values right with a heading three with

09:18.620 --> 09:22.380
a phantasm or here with an actual button.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.120
Right.

09:23.210 --> 09:28.250
So what I'm going to do here again we're is going to commandeers guy out right so we can see actually

09:28.250 --> 09:29.020
where it is.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.930
And let's add some styles.

09:31.040 --> 09:38.300
So I'm going to say image overlay and I'm going to say this is going to be let's say starting with you

09:38.300 --> 09:45.040
know what now let's do image text image text and I'm going to say heading 3 right.

09:45.050 --> 09:51.860
And what should be on here first I'm going to say this is going to be text transform and we're going

09:51.860 --> 10:01.010
to say uppercase then we're going to have a font size 20 20 pixels here then we're going to have a margin

10:01.010 --> 10:05.460
bottom five pixels using this color.

10:05.570 --> 10:10.760
We're going to use a hash that F5 F5 F5 and this.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.560
And now let's go over here to the font.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.400
Awesome.

10:13.630 --> 10:20.780
And when you say image delay and we're going to say Funtown some on here like this and we're going to

10:20.780 --> 10:26.920
have a font size over here and this is going to be 30 pixels.

10:27.280 --> 10:31.880
And then over here we're going to say this is going to be a color and we're going to use the blue color

10:31.880 --> 10:35.670
so I'm going to say or hear a hash tag right.

10:35.690 --> 10:45.050
So this is going to be hash tag and this is going to be a to b and 0 9 8 0.

10:45.080 --> 10:50.390
Right so now we have the blue color that we're going to have a padding and pixels.

10:50.390 --> 10:57.500
Then over here we're going to have a background and this is going to be hash like F5 F5 F5 here like

10:57.560 --> 10:58.340
this.

10:58.340 --> 11:00.930
And then we have a more a radius of 50.

11:01.100 --> 11:05.960
So I'm going to say border right here is 50 percent.

11:05.960 --> 11:10.820
Knowing this and then I got to we're going to have this separate transition or here for this guy.

11:11.070 --> 11:21.960
So I'm going to say transition in order here I'm going to say Trents forum on here two seconds is right

11:22.400 --> 11:29.720
and the background is here two seconds is either here right.

11:29.720 --> 11:30.670
I always say this.

11:30.680 --> 11:34.090
And now we're going to go to actual hovering effect right.

11:34.160 --> 11:43.310
So I'm going to say image here we're away and we're going to say from some one here like this and then

11:43.310 --> 11:49.610
we're going to say for a hovering right we're going to have my core here and we're going to say how

11:49.610 --> 11:52.300
we're all going to ride over here.

11:52.310 --> 12:01.180
We're going to say transform this say transform and this guy we're going to transform to translate Why

12:01.540 --> 12:07.390
so translate why we're here and we're going to say negative pixels.

12:07.490 --> 12:12.770
So as we were hovering over it's actually going to move up and pixels and that this is going to be a

12:12.770 --> 12:14.040
different ground.

12:14.270 --> 12:23.530
So the macaronis hashtags Zero Eight two to three eight or a year and all you can see what happens right.

12:23.810 --> 12:27.480
As you can see as I'm going to be hovering right this is what's going to happen.

12:27.580 --> 12:38.240
And then after that we would want a section button section here between this and here we're going to

12:38.240 --> 12:39.990
say text online.

12:40.200 --> 12:47.600
Going to say Center Yes and that over here I'm going to say a margin I don't know where this is going

12:47.600 --> 12:56.460
to be 20 pixels here then this is going to be zero and all of this is going to be 10 pixels.

12:56.460 --> 12:57.100
Right.

12:57.140 --> 13:00.020
And over here this is going to be another zero.

13:00.090 --> 13:07.730
And actually I'm already starting to apply styles to something that I didn't create in IMO in a very

13:07.820 --> 13:09.720
actually bottom right.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.210
We actually would need to create a button.

13:12.350 --> 13:17.300
So let's go back over here and here you can see that section right.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.920
This is going to be the end of portfolio.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.020
All right.

13:21.260 --> 13:22.810
Well we're going to do here.

13:23.010 --> 13:28.250
We're going to say that this is going there's going to be a section button some say we're here and this

13:28.250 --> 13:35.780
is going to be div where the class of Section really between press tab over here we're going to have

13:35.840 --> 13:44.720
a link and we're going to press tab with the link hashtag over here and are going to have a far far

13:44.720 --> 13:49.780
hour here and this is going to be a light bulb.

13:49.850 --> 13:55.520
Oh and we're going to press time again and our hero is going to write simply that this is going to be

13:55.620 --> 14:01.890
X or more projects more projects.

14:01.930 --> 14:02.470
Right.

14:02.470 --> 14:04.630
So we say again the amount.

14:04.830 --> 14:06.640
And now this should actually work.

14:06.640 --> 14:06.880
Right.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.180
So we'll then have a section between.

14:10.510 --> 14:12.080
So it's going back on here.

14:12.250 --> 14:17.650
And we have a section between tax law and center margin like this right.

14:17.710 --> 14:22.710
And then let's add some more styles or here for the actual link.

14:23.110 --> 14:29.680
So what I'm going to say here is I'm going to say very simple and this is going to be section between

14:29.770 --> 14:35.800
a right to know I'm working with going on here I'm going to say this play and we're going to say in

14:35.880 --> 14:46.330
mine block this and we're going to have a padding 0.5 AMS like this and you can see what we're working

14:46.330 --> 14:47.580
on here right.

14:47.650 --> 14:51.250
And then we'll will have a text decoration.

14:51.250 --> 14:57.430
None here and there we're going to have a font size 30 pixels.

14:57.520 --> 15:08.370
Then after that we're going to have here a color and color is going to be EF 5 5 5 5.

15:08.950 --> 15:12.060
And the background and the background is going to be the moon.

15:12.250 --> 15:23.680
So we're going to hashtag to be 9 8 0 here so have zero blue background and or here are going to have

15:23.770 --> 15:25.240
a transition again.

15:25.490 --> 15:25.770
Right.

15:25.790 --> 15:30.530
So I'm going to say background 2 seconds.

15:30.550 --> 15:31.830
He is.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.850
And then we're going to have a caller.

15:34.180 --> 15:37.840
Two seconds is he is here.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.870
So both of those things are going to change.

15:40.060 --> 15:46.660
So let's go back over here and we're going to say this is going to be section or here section and this

15:46.660 --> 15:53.640
is going to be between a and we're going to have our own or here we're going to write a color.

15:53.710 --> 16:03.020
And again this is going to be the blue color print so we can just grab this guy over here and copy and

16:03.020 --> 16:07.080
pasted over here and then we're going to have a background.

16:07.310 --> 16:10.110
5 5 5 1 here.

16:10.130 --> 16:12.320
So basically it's going to be the opposite way.

16:12.350 --> 16:12.990
Right.

16:13.040 --> 16:17.080
So now I can see this is going to be white and this is going to be that afternoon.

16:17.090 --> 16:19.350
Let's do one last thing.

16:19.570 --> 16:31.720
I'm going to say a section on here between a class of F A and font size let's say 40 40 pixels or we're

16:31.750 --> 16:33.800
all going to say margin right.

16:33.950 --> 16:36.890
And this is going to be 10 pixels.

16:37.040 --> 16:43.340
So basically we just pushed this guy a little bit away from from the actual text and now we're actually

16:43.340 --> 16:48.110
ready to go back over here where we are uncommon in margin bottom.

16:48.150 --> 16:49.290
Going back over here.

16:49.370 --> 16:50.990
Now it's going to be coming in.

16:51.090 --> 16:53.690
And now let's add some media queries.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.370
So this would be responsive.
