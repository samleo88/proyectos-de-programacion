00:00.360 --> 00:06.450
The next section are going to be making is going to be portfolio section here so you can see what's

00:06.450 --> 00:09.630
happening right as I'm hovering over the image.

00:09.810 --> 00:14.870
You can see in the background gets darker than on here we have this overlay with the job name.

00:14.950 --> 00:20.790
It's going to be careful location and we're here this is going to be our phantasm like art right which

00:20.790 --> 00:22.630
could serve as a link right.

00:22.780 --> 00:25.430
And you can see that it will I have this effect here.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.330
So again let's go back to you now.

00:28.470 --> 00:34.390
First thing we're going to say is this is going to be portfolio port when we go on here.

00:34.390 --> 00:40.950
Let's just grab the line copy and paste this and I'm going to say and of portfolio.

00:41.150 --> 00:46.210
Then told that within the portfolio we're actually again have a title.

00:46.220 --> 00:51.490
All right so we can just go again and serve and find where is the actual time no.

00:51.730 --> 00:52.890
Oh that's right.

00:52.890 --> 00:58.610
So if we select this this and then are going to copy this.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.480
And if we go down.

01:00.520 --> 01:00.750
Right.

01:00.750 --> 01:02.550
So where is the portfolio.

01:02.550 --> 01:09.020
The first thing that we're going to say and this is going to be section with an ID port folio.

01:09.350 --> 01:14.760
They don't have a press tab and then copy and paste this right in or here instead of services this is

01:14.760 --> 01:18.670
going to be portfolio support for you.

01:18.960 --> 01:22.330
Then after that we would want the actual article right.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.280
The actual items.

01:24.310 --> 01:29.310
So we're going to go here and again we're going to say like this when you say this is going to be a

01:29.330 --> 01:36.030
div with a glass of port folio or here Center press tab.

01:36.090 --> 01:37.400
Right now we have to.

01:37.540 --> 01:45.110
We're here we're going to have an article here and here we're going to have a class of work press time.

01:45.110 --> 01:47.830
But now we have an article with a class of work.

01:48.050 --> 01:51.890
And again we can maybe write a way over here at a comment.

01:51.890 --> 01:59.640
All right and this is going to be a single one here work item single work and I'm just so we don't get

01:59.640 --> 02:00.690
lost.

02:00.730 --> 02:06.680
And again if we select this line I don't have a copy this one and copy and paste it.

02:06.700 --> 02:15.640
Right now we have single work item and on it's place and and and then within an article what we would

02:15.640 --> 02:16.470
want.

02:16.500 --> 02:22.510
So first of all I'd want an image right here and say this is going to be image and then our here going

02:22.550 --> 02:28.190
to say source and or hear from the source we're going to say images product one.

02:28.410 --> 02:33.350
So let's go here to images here and we're going to save product one.

02:33.350 --> 02:38.250
So that's going to be my name for my image or here just for the image you're going to get with a class

02:38.250 --> 02:40.730
of image or hair box.

02:40.980 --> 02:43.860
Let's close over here and I can see this is what we have.

02:43.870 --> 02:44.220
Right.

02:44.360 --> 02:51.710
So now we have the image here underneath the image we're going to have a div here with the class and

02:51.810 --> 02:58.340
we're going to say image text on here like this and this is going to be the name of the day.

02:58.650 --> 03:02.590
And over here we would need to have two things right.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.910
Well first of all we actually messed up over here a little bit.

03:05.910 --> 03:10.150
We have to have a div with the class of image or lay.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.210
This is going to be the image.

03:13.390 --> 03:20.360
Well they might because what's going to happen is that there's Dave with a glass of image next Actually

03:20.490 --> 03:24.110
it's going to be one side and the link is going to be the other side.

03:24.290 --> 03:24.670
Right.

03:24.690 --> 03:26.970
So because we want them side by side.

03:27.270 --> 03:32.480
So Dave class of image next door here this is going to be handing three and this is going to be over

03:32.480 --> 03:36.800
here we're going to say this is going to be job name right here press tab.

03:36.810 --> 03:39.730
Now we have the heading three and over here we're going to write.

03:39.730 --> 03:41.040
This is going to be paragraph.

03:41.080 --> 03:48.090
You know we're here we're going to say this is going to be a California here and we're going to say

03:48.090 --> 03:50.890
USA USA or here.

03:51.180 --> 03:54.230
Press time and now we have the paragraph.

03:54.260 --> 03:55.340
Then after that.

03:55.470 --> 04:00.590
Right next to the image next we're actually going to have a image icon.

04:00.630 --> 04:02.630
So what are you saying we're here.

04:02.800 --> 04:07.310
This is going to be a live image here.

04:07.530 --> 04:15.930
I can press time on here and with this I got actually going to place a link some of them say hey press

04:15.930 --> 04:18.900
over here and make me tag right.

04:18.910 --> 04:25.890
And then over here I'm going to say this is going to be high for far here and this is going to be our

04:26.080 --> 04:34.600
All right write or hear press tab now I can see that now we have a right.

04:34.890 --> 04:39.230
And now we're actually done with one article with single work.

04:39.520 --> 04:46.170
So our next line of business is going to be actually copying them and pasting them and making six of

04:46.430 --> 04:47.040
them.

04:47.100 --> 04:54.070
So again I can go back over here and select the whole thing and maybe Let's start over here with these

04:54.070 --> 04:55.210
comments.

04:55.210 --> 04:56.700
So we're going to we're going to go like this.

04:56.710 --> 05:02.880
So the whole thing we're going to copy it and we actually need to copy and paste it six times.

05:02.890 --> 05:08.440
This is going to be one two three four five and we're here one by one.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.370
The only thing we need to change over here.

05:10.420 --> 05:16.270
This is going to be a product to then after that we're going to have well you know what.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.200
No this is the wrong place.

05:18.220 --> 05:23.470
So if we have the first one on here this is going to be the second one.

05:23.480 --> 05:27.850
Then after that we're going to have a number three over here.

05:27.970 --> 05:31.150
Then I have to go we're going to have number four.

05:31.390 --> 05:36.440
This is going to be number five and this one is going to be number six.

05:36.550 --> 05:39.630
So we added six items over here.

05:39.730 --> 05:46.540
And what I would want to do is say it over here right now and go to see assess and start styling this.
