WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:04.440
Our next target is probably going to be the most challenging one because we're going to be working on

00:04.440 --> 00:09.990
the product and what's really cool about the products that we're going to look at the nested floating

00:09.990 --> 00:15.630
thing where we're going to have to column layout to begin with some of the products and the pictures

00:15.660 --> 00:20.120
all of them are gonna be one column and this is going to be all second column.

00:20.220 --> 00:24.910
However within the second column we're also gonna do another three column layout.

00:25.010 --> 00:26.890
So I think this is gonna be really cool.

00:26.910 --> 00:32.160
We're also gonna reuse quite a few things you'll see that we're going to be reusing the section center

00:32.550 --> 00:35.170
or reusing the title as well as the button.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.050
So you'll see more and more.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.880
The neat thing of creating some kind of class that you can reuse it throughout our project.

00:42.090 --> 00:48.000
As always our journey is gonna have to begin with indexation email because we cannot really style anything

00:48.000 --> 00:49.890
unless there's some kind of content.

00:50.090 --> 00:57.380
The spiel is going to be products then end of product and that's gonna be our setup and not end for

00:57.740 --> 00:59.790
but end of product.

00:59.790 --> 01:05.250
HERE WE'RE GONNA START WITH A SECTION NOW THE SECTION IS GONNA HAVE THE CLASS OF SURPRISED YOU GUESSED

01:05.250 --> 01:08.540
IT product and then we're gonna be looking right away for the day.

01:08.550 --> 01:13.650
We're the class of Section center as well as because we will gonna be floating it twice.

01:13.770 --> 01:18.890
So we all gonna be floating two of these columns and then three of the smaller ones we will gonna add

01:18.900 --> 01:24.660
not only section of center there's gonna add nice padding and the width but also we're gonna use the

01:24.660 --> 01:25.340
clear fix.

01:25.440 --> 01:30.780
Remember our little hack that we had before and the moment we were going to save it I was gonna be getting

01:30.780 --> 01:35.220
a bigger screen now I cannot see anything obviously we haven't played that here but I already see that

01:35.220 --> 01:42.630
I'm getting the the width here with a paddock right now what is gonna be within this div well here we're

01:42.630 --> 01:44.790
gonna have two again columns to begin with.

01:45.270 --> 01:52.000
So we're going to have product info column in form and then we're going to have product inventory now

01:52.000 --> 01:54.640
for this let me add first of all an article.

01:54.640 --> 02:02.080
Now this article is gonna have products info class that's gonna be for styling and here I can copy and

02:02.080 --> 02:11.710
paste them both and let's set up maybe here the product inventory so we're gonna have to I'm not selectors

02:12.040 --> 02:17.190
to cursors and we're gonna write inventory that's gonna be our second column.

02:17.380 --> 02:20.080
Like I said from the start we're gonna have to come.

02:20.770 --> 02:25.390
And then within this inventory there's going to be another 3Com layer and that's the reason why we're

02:25.390 --> 02:28.230
having the nested layout here.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.940
Let's start very simply by having a title.

02:31.030 --> 02:33.900
Now we already created the title in a previous section.

02:33.940 --> 02:40.740
Remember this was the about and this was the skills now within the about we had a section title.

02:40.900 --> 02:42.220
So why don't we borrow this.

02:42.220 --> 02:44.530
Why don't we say that we're going to scroll down.

02:44.530 --> 02:46.140
We're going to look for products in four.

02:46.570 --> 02:49.030
And the first thing we're going to copy and paste is the title.

02:49.540 --> 02:53.310
Now here again obviously we would like to change the values.

02:53.460 --> 03:04.930
So going to say check out that's gonna be the subtitle and for the title we're gonna use our products.

03:04.930 --> 03:08.110
Hopefully you can see how nifty this is.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.800
We don't have to again recreate it.

03:09.820 --> 03:12.370
And I know that I'm gonna say this probably 50 more times.

03:12.370 --> 03:20.470
But the point that I'm kind of trying to hammer home is the fact that you want to like try to at least

03:20.810 --> 03:24.710
set up something globally where you can reuse this.

03:24.730 --> 03:28.930
Now that doesn't mean that you're gonna be able to do it with each and every section because obviously

03:28.960 --> 03:31.030
there's gonna be unique things about the section.

03:31.180 --> 03:34.290
Otherwise you're just gonna be copying pasting and dissection.

03:34.480 --> 03:39.970
But let's say having some kind of titles some kind of layout things it does make sense to create them

03:39.970 --> 03:45.340
once and then reuse them instead of each and every time that you come back and back and back and so

03:45.340 --> 03:46.570
on and so forth.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.290
What else we're going gonna have while there is a title.

03:49.300 --> 03:59.760
So we have in the title and I think we're gonna have a nice paragraph with a class of product taxed

04:00.400 --> 04:02.070
here within the paragraph.

04:02.070 --> 04:02.550
That's right.

04:02.560 --> 04:06.420
I don't know 20 words so lower I'm 20 and you know what.

04:06.420 --> 04:10.830
We also can place a button now the button is gonna be right now or you know what.

04:10.950 --> 04:16.260
Well class is gonna be main button but it's gonna be actually a link and this link is gonna be pointing

04:16.260 --> 04:18.720
to again the page that we don't have.

04:18.810 --> 04:20.360
So productivity email.

04:20.460 --> 04:26.740
However we do need to have this class of main medium so our main button and then let's write here.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.130
Inventory is gonna be written.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.650
Button and I think this is looks really awesome.

04:32.650 --> 04:33.780
So I have the title.

04:33.780 --> 04:36.480
We didn't have to struggle with any kind of success.

04:36.570 --> 04:42.720
Everything is already premade and we can move on and we can start working on our next column which is

04:42.720 --> 04:44.040
gonna be product inventory.

04:44.790 --> 04:47.760
Here's the kicker though as you're looking at it what do you see.

04:47.760 --> 04:54.450
Well you see two column layout and then another three column layout since we are again using the floats

04:54.450 --> 04:55.140
for this.

04:55.140 --> 04:57.510
We need to use the clear fix again.

04:57.510 --> 04:59.850
So I'm gonna n I'm gonna copy and paste the class.

05:00.270 --> 05:04.050
So just so I don't get some surprise results or anything like that.

05:04.380 --> 05:09.510
And then within this inventory there's gonna be three products for each of the products I'm gonna use

05:09.510 --> 05:14.470
single product as a comment as well as copy pasted.

05:14.550 --> 05:19.140
I'm gonna write and off single product and within a single product we're gonna have a few things.

05:19.170 --> 05:20.690
Well first of all this is gonna be Dave.

05:20.970 --> 05:23.510
You can create this as an article.

05:23.540 --> 05:24.640
Is also an option.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.140
Ah you know what.

05:25.170 --> 05:25.350
Yeah.

05:25.380 --> 05:26.770
Let's just go with article.

05:26.970 --> 05:32.040
Just so you don't think that I'm actually lying to you but in general again we could have used the Dave

05:32.310 --> 05:38.190
but we can use the article and we can say here we're gonna be looking for first of all image.

05:38.190 --> 05:39.830
So first there's gonna be an image.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.540
Now the image is gonna be massive.

05:41.610 --> 05:45.920
I can tell you right away that this is again gonna mess up pretty much all of review.

05:45.990 --> 05:51.210
But you know we do need to place them so first let's start looking for images then we're gonna be looking

05:51.210 --> 05:57.060
for product one and then you know what for alternatives I will gonna cheat a little bit.

05:57.060 --> 06:02.670
I'm just gonna say product because I don't want to look at the image and then go to the text in general

06:02.670 --> 06:07.410
obviously you need to write something that reflects this image but I'm just gonna cheat a little bit

06:08.070 --> 06:08.820
as well as you know what.

06:08.820 --> 06:14.760
Let's add some class and the class is gonna be product image.

06:14.760 --> 06:19.830
Now it's gonna be for my image and then right of the image we're gonna have two things we're going to

06:19.830 --> 06:26.990
have heading three with the class of product title so class of product title.

06:27.120 --> 06:34.290
And here let's write product title as you can see that again I was being held lazy even with the finished

06:34.290 --> 06:35.150
project.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.250
I didn't see the point of writing this.

06:37.380 --> 06:39.100
You can write whatever you want.

06:39.210 --> 06:39.690
What are you.

06:39.720 --> 06:41.360
Whatever you feel like for the product.

06:41.380 --> 06:43.180
But I'm just gonna skip a little bit.

06:43.230 --> 06:48.120
I'm gonna say product title because that's the whole idea of what we're gonna have there some say product

06:48.120 --> 06:54.240
title and you know what I will gonna copy paste this and I'm going to say for the second one this is

06:54.240 --> 06:55.920
not going to be product title.

06:55.920 --> 07:05.210
This will be product price product price and let's set up some kind of default price of six ninety nine.

07:05.490 --> 07:07.630
That's gonna be our first product.

07:07.680 --> 07:11.610
Like I said the image is gonna be massive and a little bit annoying right now.

07:11.670 --> 07:16.650
So you just need to bear with me where we will gonna copy and paste this single product.

07:16.650 --> 07:19.420
So we're gonna start from the first comment to the second one.

07:19.430 --> 07:24.960
1 2 and then we just need to change the images again we're not gonna be changing or at least I'm not

07:24.960 --> 07:31.890
gonna be changing any kind of text here and I would like to say that product number three product number

07:31.910 --> 07:35.490
2 and product number 1 We already have.

07:35.490 --> 07:42.030
This is how our product section should look like not right now as we're done with HCM normal and we're

07:42.030 --> 07:44.360
ready to go and start styling it in the as.
