WEBVTT

00:00.370 --> 00:06.750
And once we have our basic structure why don't we add styling so it looks a bit nicer.

00:06.750 --> 00:13.050
Now in this case I am going to add a few more comments because remember we still need to set up or not

00:13.050 --> 00:14.510
bar later on anyway.

00:14.700 --> 00:18.980
So I'm going to copy and paste it in fact four times then.

00:19.170 --> 00:27.200
In this case I'm gonna write for her then of course and the footer and then we're gonna have a nav bar

00:28.130 --> 00:32.060
and our last comment is just gonna signal another number.

00:32.060 --> 00:35.170
Now technically you don't have to have the end of Navarre.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.830
I'm just going to add it anyway.

00:37.360 --> 00:43.280
Now within a footer let's start with the background color and we're gonna do that by targeting the footer

00:43.280 --> 00:44.520
class.

00:44.640 --> 00:45.950
What's the background.

00:45.950 --> 00:50.370
We're gonna go with var main black like so.

00:50.720 --> 00:57.230
So we had our background then we're gonna go for the color and the color is going to be main white.

00:57.380 --> 00:58.390
So that's right.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.430
Main white.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.860
And there you go.

01:00.860 --> 01:03.500
Now our color is in fact man white.

01:03.500 --> 01:06.740
Now of course the color is not main white for our links.

01:06.740 --> 01:11.560
So we're gonna have to do that separately for the font awesome icon as well as the links.

01:11.740 --> 01:12.320
Okay.

01:12.450 --> 01:20.370
Now I do want to set everything in a center so text align center then padding the left and padding right.

01:20.480 --> 01:23.370
We're gonna do let's say two arms.

01:23.900 --> 01:31.890
So let's write putting ring left the left is going to be two arms.

01:32.020 --> 01:36.470
So and putting right is also gonna be two areas.

01:36.550 --> 01:39.750
Let's set them up like so.

01:40.030 --> 01:44.500
And next one up we're gonna work with footer links and footer icons.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.200
So both of these bad boys.

01:47.270 --> 01:48.160
Yeah.

01:48.400 --> 01:58.880
Now let's select both of them footer links karma footer icons and then let's just say display flex so

01:58.900 --> 02:00.520
display the muscle flex.

02:00.530 --> 02:02.170
And that's number one.

02:02.170 --> 02:04.640
Then I would like to use justified content.

02:05.150 --> 02:09.140
So justify content and let's in fact set them up in the center.

02:09.160 --> 02:14.800
Most of them like so both of them are gonna have some kind of margin and bottom and I'm gonna go with

02:14.800 --> 02:22.420
one point five more dreams and then I'm also gonna set up some flex wrap just in case the screen size

02:22.420 --> 02:30.510
gets too small and we need to wrap it into your line so let's write for legs wrap is equal to wrap.

02:30.580 --> 02:31.570
All right.

02:31.660 --> 02:34.920
Now more specifically we have two things.

02:35.020 --> 02:41.200
We have a footwear icon that is of course my fantasy and my cousins social media icons.

02:41.410 --> 02:43.540
And then I have a photo or a link.

02:43.540 --> 02:51.250
So now once we have the setup for all of them whether that's icons and links I'm going to target specifically

02:51.250 --> 02:57.210
the links first and I'm going to do that by selecting footer link that is my class.

02:57.340 --> 03:02.240
And in this case I am going to setup the color of course var main white.

03:02.260 --> 03:05.350
So I'm going to go with the main white leg.

03:05.370 --> 03:07.630
So so now my color is white.

03:07.720 --> 03:12.940
Then also let's capitalize the text text transform capitalized font size.

03:12.960 --> 03:19.830
Now I could go with one hour aims like so then let's maybe add margin right.

03:19.870 --> 03:21.590
One hour Ms.

03:21.760 --> 03:29.980
Margin right long RTM and we'll see I think that looks good enough.

03:29.980 --> 03:30.520
Then you're not.

03:30.520 --> 03:36.700
Why don't we and maybe at one point one or something like that just so it's little bit bigger differences

03:37.210 --> 03:41.800
letter spacing we can do the main spacing letter spacing.

03:41.980 --> 03:51.460
Var dash dash Maine's pacing like so now we have letter spacing and as you clearly can see since we

03:51.460 --> 03:55.540
have the Flex wrap we nicely wrap to the next line.

03:55.540 --> 03:59.900
Once we get to the smaller screen size as well as there's going to be some transition.

04:00.010 --> 04:05.860
So as I'm hovering I would like to have a different color but I would like that change to be over time.

04:05.950 --> 04:08.580
So why don't we do transition.

04:08.980 --> 04:15.610
And we have the variable remember main transition like so.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.560
And then why don't we set up the other effect.

04:18.560 --> 04:25.980
So footer link hover as we're hovering and we should want a different color color of our.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.250
And we're going to go with not main spacing.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.140
We're going to go with the primary color.

04:32.170 --> 04:33.550
I think that's good enough.

04:33.670 --> 04:39.580
Now there's one thing that I need to fix remember that when we set up the links thing I made a mistake

04:39.610 --> 04:47.630
by not in fact using two cursors and I did it the second time and the first time.

04:47.710 --> 04:51.210
I would like to fix where as you see I have two home links.

04:51.400 --> 04:56.010
So the value in this text should be about.

04:56.220 --> 04:57.460
Now let me fix that.

04:57.550 --> 05:05.320
And now that is fixed then within the styles we still need to deal with footer icon and copyright.

05:05.320 --> 05:09.130
So let's select water icon.

05:09.220 --> 05:13.550
Now what I would want for each and every icon while we could increase the font size.

05:13.580 --> 05:21.820
Well let's say one point and nine our Iams something like that margin right is again going to be one

05:21.820 --> 05:22.820
our aims.

05:23.030 --> 05:28.210
Just so there is some margin in between color is going to be also made right.

05:28.210 --> 05:33.480
So are main white like so.

05:33.490 --> 05:36.150
And then lastly let's add also a transition.

05:36.580 --> 05:37.510
So let's try.

05:37.500 --> 05:45.310
Transition and this is going to be a main transition transitions transition var when we had the variable

05:45.310 --> 05:50.240
of main transition and we're going to set up a primary color as well.

05:50.290 --> 05:55.690
So as I'm hovering the links the links are going to be displayed with primary color and the same old

05:55.690 --> 05:57.480
one for my hat cons.

05:57.490 --> 06:09.190
So let's go with footer link I'm sorry not link icon hover and let's change the color by color of our.

06:09.350 --> 06:12.310
And let's go with primary color like so.

06:13.090 --> 06:18.070
So the same thing happens right now to the links and you know it also may be why don't we push it up

06:18.070 --> 06:19.550
a little bit more icons.

06:19.570 --> 06:27.370
And for that we could use a transformed property and I could set this up as translate y so y direction

06:27.520 --> 06:29.930
and I'm going to move it like 10 percent.

06:29.970 --> 06:35.880
Right now if I would like to move it up I need to go negative value so I'm going to go negative 10 percent.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.370
Let's save that.

06:37.450 --> 06:44.180
And we should be able to see our icons are in fact more than 10 percent up as we're hovering over them.

06:44.260 --> 06:48.700
Now last thing let's set up the copyright copy right.

06:48.700 --> 06:56.910
Class and for that particular class we're going to go with text transform capitalized on like so what

06:56.910 --> 07:04.760
else we would like to do maybe letter spacing some letter and letter spacing is going to be main spacing

07:06.050 --> 07:07.570
main spacing.

07:07.670 --> 07:11.480
And as you can see how nice it is once you set up your variables.

07:11.570 --> 07:17.380
Then again if you would like to use the same value well you can just access that one particular variable.

07:17.420 --> 07:22.850
Now if you don't like that value in that variable let's say you just change it in one place and then

07:22.910 --> 07:25.450
it is affected anywhere you used it.

07:25.460 --> 07:32.120
Now of course if you're using a specific custom value for that particular scenario then you cannot do

07:32.120 --> 07:36.500
it but in most cases setting up variables is very very neat.

07:36.500 --> 07:41.120
Now once we're done with our footer we're ready to work on our NAV bar.
