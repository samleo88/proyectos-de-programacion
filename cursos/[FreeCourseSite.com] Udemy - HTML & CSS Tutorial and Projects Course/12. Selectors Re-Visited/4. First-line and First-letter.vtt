00:00.240 --> 00:01.050
Next one up.

00:01.050 --> 00:07.560
We have two pseudo elements which would be first line and first letter and just by looking at him I

00:07.560 --> 00:12.390
think they're all going to be much more straightforward than the before and after.

00:12.420 --> 00:17.010
So the first one is going to style the first line and the second one is going to work with the first

00:17.010 --> 00:18.450
letter as always.

00:18.450 --> 00:21.900
Let's get rid of everything that we had in the previous one.

00:22.020 --> 00:23.540
Say it in the annex.

00:23.550 --> 00:25.360
This is going to be very simple.

00:25.480 --> 00:31.010
Who's gonna work with not a div where we're going to have the paragraph then the paragraph is gonna

00:31.010 --> 00:31.290
have.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.880
I don't know Lorem 30 words something like this.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.120
This is gonna be my paragraph.

00:36.540 --> 00:42.660
And then if we head over back to the C assess we can just say paragraph and use the first line.

00:42.660 --> 00:49.920
So this is gonna style the first line in our case we can just say font way is gonna be let's say bold.

00:50.010 --> 00:55.530
So now wait there's gonna be mold however if you'd want the first letter to be bigger again the same

00:55.530 --> 01:01.890
thing we are working with first letter and let's say font size is gonna be I don't know three are m

01:01.920 --> 01:04.320
so as straightforward as it gets.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.090
First line and first letter.
