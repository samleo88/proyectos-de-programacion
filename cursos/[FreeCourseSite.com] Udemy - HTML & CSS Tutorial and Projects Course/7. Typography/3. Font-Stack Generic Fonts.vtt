All is well and dandy but what if browser that the user is using does not support the funds we have

00:06.890 --> 00:07.150
pick.

00:07.850 --> 00:10.450
Well I guess we're in deep trouble.

00:10.610 --> 00:12.030
Not so fast.

00:12.080 --> 00:17.520
You see for fun family property we can add several fun families as a fallback system.

00:17.810 --> 00:24.040
So if the browser does not support the first one it can try getting next one and so on and so forth.

00:24.110 --> 00:25.620
We call that a phone stack.

00:26.180 --> 00:33.290
And what's also interesting at the end of the phone stack we can pass a generic font family that allows

00:33.290 --> 00:36.850
browser to pick similar funds from generic family.

00:36.890 --> 00:38.420
So let's see that in action.

00:38.510 --> 00:44.480
As you can see right now we have the Helvetica and we have the done it but whenever we were writing

00:44.480 --> 00:50.810
them you probably noticed how right away individuals to your code gave us multiple options.

00:50.810 --> 00:54.770
Now again let's test that out first because it's gonna be easier for me to show you.

00:55.220 --> 00:59.930
So let's say first we're gonna get rid of the heading One so I'm going to comment this out and let me

00:59.930 --> 01:01.780
just delete this whole etiquette.

01:01.870 --> 01:03.780
The moment I typed font family.

01:03.840 --> 01:04.550
What's gonna happen.

01:04.970 --> 01:08.050
Well actually this shouldn't gives me suggestions and it doesn't.

01:08.060 --> 01:13.110
So what I would need to do is press control and spacebar again that's gonna be with them.

01:13.250 --> 01:15.050
Now what do you see or hear.

01:15.710 --> 01:21.740
Well there's gonna be bunch of fonts and the way they are written is not just one family.

01:21.920 --> 01:23.390
It's in fact like this.

01:23.450 --> 01:28.370
So you're gonna have one fun family then you're going to have another one and then you'll have the third

01:28.370 --> 01:29.070
one.

01:29.270 --> 01:34.380
Now third one is the generic one and this whole thing is called stuff.

01:34.670 --> 01:36.800
So we're gonna try with our favorite one.

01:37.040 --> 01:44.060
If the browser doesn't have it OK pick this guy then if this one is not available grab this generic

01:44.060 --> 01:50.360
font family and pick some kind of font that will at least match better than just passing some kind of

01:50.360 --> 01:50.950
default one.

01:51.450 --> 01:53.400
And that's the whole idea here.

01:53.510 --> 02:00.350
Now the generic ones are served and serve cursive fantasy and the minus bass and sure enough now I can

02:00.350 --> 02:05.270
see that everything is pretty much in this font family as well as you know what let's do the same thing

02:05.270 --> 02:06.470
with that one.

02:06.590 --> 02:08.790
Now let me again come on this.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.870
So we're going to have Herring one and the same thing is gonna work.

02:11.930 --> 02:13.090
Let's say we're done.

02:13.430 --> 02:16.180
What we're getting is Donna Geneva home.

02:16.310 --> 02:23.360
And then we're looking for this generic one that we're gonna try to supply at least some type of font

02:23.840 --> 02:30.100
from this generic family that would match this guy that we picked already in the beginning again.

02:30.110 --> 02:35.680
It's obviously not gonna be exactly the same but at least it's not gonna be default browser font fan.
