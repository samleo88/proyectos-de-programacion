Hey guys before we deep dive into sea assessed transitions transformations and animations I would like

00:06.120 --> 00:13.110
to take a quick pit stop and revisit selectors insists some of you might be wondering well why are we

00:13.110 --> 00:17.100
just taking a quick pit stop and not for long two hour stop.

00:17.460 --> 00:18.810
Well here's the thing.

00:18.810 --> 00:23.840
Yes there are many more selectors names here says I am fully aware of that.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.830
But here's my argument.

00:25.830 --> 00:28.760
You want to use the RSS to make cool stuff right.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.710
Web Search Applications and so on and so forth.

00:31.950 --> 00:37.570
And to tell you honestly we can easily do all those things just by using simple selectors.

00:37.620 --> 00:43.980
So I think it is much more productive that we cover only basic selectors start creating awesome stuff

00:44.430 --> 00:50.070
and then if we need to get something very specific done and we need a very specific CSO selector for

00:50.070 --> 00:53.390
that we can always go back and learn that selector.

00:53.400 --> 01:00.000
So in this module we will refresh on selector basics as well as covers some other essentials CSF selectors.
