1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,149
Alright, welcome back guys. So before we

2

00:00:02,159  -->  00:00:03,710
actually go any further what we need to

3

00:00:03,720  -->  00:00:07,940
do is actually create some more posts in

4

00:00:07,950  -->  00:00:10,430
our application here. So I really don't

5

00:00:10,440  -->  00:00:12,290
recall the username and password that I

6

00:00:12,300  -->  00:00:14,120
set,

7

00:00:14,130  -->  00:00:17,180
oh awesome I got it right.

8

00:00:17,190  -->  00:00:19,370
So in post we only have one post but

9

00:00:19,380  -->  00:00:21,710
we're working on an index page right now

10

00:00:21,720  -->  00:00:24,650
and so Index Test is going to be the

11

00:00:24,660  -->  00:00:27,349
name of this, slug is going to be index-test,

12

00:00:27,359  -->  00:00:32,269
summary is going to be This is to show

13

00:00:32,279  -->  00:00:37,850
more than one post. I'm going to go get

14

00:00:37,860  -->  00:00:50,420
some lipsum,

15

00:00:50,430  -->  00:00:53,870
paste that in there, and then i'm going

16

00:00:53,880  -->  00:00:55,610
to save it. Is there a way that I can

17

00:00:55,620  -->  00:00:59,900
duplicate posts, actually. That'd be neat.

18

00:00:59,910  -->  00:01:04,670
No, I can't. Alright, unless published view

19

00:01:04,680  -->  00:01:05,570
on site,

20

00:01:05,580  -->  00:01:07,190
nope. Let's go ahead and create one more.

21

00:01:07,200  -->  00:01:13,730
Title is going to be Awesome post number

22

00:01:13,740  -->  00:01:24,830
three or 4, sure. I'm going to post the

23

00:01:24,840  -->  00:01:27,620
same lipsum actually in there, going to

24

00:01:27,630  -->  00:01:30,139
save, now we've got three posts so that's

25

00:01:30,149  -->  00:01:32,600
awesome. What we're going to do now is in

26

00:01:32,610  -->  00:01:38,420
our...here we go. In our views file

27

00:01:38,430  -->  00:01:40,700
right here we need to import the post

28

00:01:40,710  -->  00:01:42,560
for models. So if we go ahead and open up

29

00:01:42,570  -->  00:01:45,260
models we will see this is the object, this

30

00:01:45,270  -->  00:01:47,719
for each one of these posts it adheres

31

00:01:47,729  -->  00:01:50,300
to this structure, and so we will have

32

00:01:50,310  -->  00:01:52,190
access to the title of the slug, the

33

00:01:52,200  -->  00:01:54,859
summary, etc. So what we're gonna do is

34

00:01:54,869  -->  00:01:56,630
we're going to import this file into the

35

00:01:56,640  -->  00:02:00,230
views file. So let's go ahead "from

36

00:02:00,240  -->  00:02:02,450
.models" it means from the current

37

00:02:02,460  -->  00:02:08,810
directory models "import Post" and then

38

00:02:08,820  -->  00:02:10,280
the index page here we're just going to

39

00:02:10,290  -->  00:02:12,500
get all of the posts. So let's go ahead

40

00:02:12,510  -->  00:02:15,229
and create a variable called

41

00:02:15,239  -->  00:02:20,060
"posts = Post.objects.all( )" it's

42

00:02:20,070  -->  00:02:21,289
really that simple.

43

00:02:21,299  -->  00:02:24,380
Now, we won't have access in the HTML

44

00:02:24,390  -->  00:02:26,750
right now just by creating the variable,

45

00:02:26,760  -->  00:02:28,820
what we need to do is that passed as a

46

00:02:28,830  -->  00:02:31,850
parameter and it's going to pass the

47

00:02:31,860  -->  00:02:35,000
variable into the HTML file here. So

48

00:02:35,010  -->  00:02:36,410
we're going to create this just like any

49

00:02:36,420  -->  00:02:38,840
regular dictionary object so i'm gonna

50

00:02:38,850  -->  00:02:42,470
create a value for key {'posts': and it's going to

51

00:02:42,480  -->  00:02:45,229
be equal to the "posts" variable. So i'm

52

00:02:45,239  -->  00:02:47,180
going to go ahead and save this. It's not

53

00:02:47,190  -->  00:02:50,630
going to do anything right now. I'm going

54

00:02:50,640  -->  00:02:52,910
to view the site here and it still says

55

00:02:52,920  -->  00:02:54,650
I'm an index page and that's because we

56

00:02:54,660  -->  00:02:57,080
haven't done anything in the HTML page.

57

00:02:57,090  -->  00:03:00,470
So, here's the fun bit. What we're going

58

00:03:00,480  -->  00:03:02,599
to do there's two different types of syntax's that

59

00:03:03,240  -->  00:03:05,450
we need to use here, and i'm going to explain

60

00:03:05,460  -->  00:03:12,050
each one. So, you're going to see this and

61

00:03:12,060  -->  00:03:15,620
that's going to be used for beginning or

62

00:03:15,630  -->  00:03:18,170
ending blocks of code. So let's go ahead

63

00:03:18,180  -->  00:03:25,040
and type {% for post in posts %} and then

64

00:03:25,050  -->  00:03:29,840
we're going to end that right there {% endfor %}

65

00:03:29,850  -->  00:03:33,080
And now this is just a typical for

66

00:03:33,090  -->  00:03:34,940
statement. So what we're going to do in

67

00:03:34,950  -->  00:03:36,920
here is we're going to create a &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; for

68

00:03:36,930  -->  00:03:41,000
each post, and then an &lt;h3&gt; &lt;h3&gt; element and

69

00:03:41,010  -->  00:03:42,920
this is going to have the title. So you

70

00:03:42,930  -->  00:03:44,750
don't open it like this

71

00:03:44,760  -->  00:03:46,490
that's not going to work right here, what

72

00:03:46,500  -->  00:03:49,040
we need to do to print out variables is

73

00:03:49,050  -->  00:03:51,350
open it with two curly braces on each

74

00:03:51,360  -->  00:03:53,090
side, and then we're going to print out

75

00:03:53,100  -->  00:03:59,360
{{ post.title }} and underneath it here we're

76

00:03:59,370  -->  00:04:06,770
going to let's go ahead and just print

77

00:04:06,780  -->  00:04:11,030
out the summary for now &lt;p&gt;{{ post.summary }}&lt;/p&gt;

78

00:04:11,040  -->  00:04:15,800
and let's save it. Now when this refreshes,

79

00:04:15,810  -->  00:04:21,680
did it just refresh, I guess it did, ok. So it's

80

00:04:21,690  -->  00:04:25,460
showing the title from each post, it's not showing

81

00:04:25,470  -->  00:04:32,510
the summary. Did i do that wrong? I did

82

00:04:32,520  -->  00:04:35,660
something wrong, I think, hold on. Let's inspect this.

83

00:04:35,670  -->  00:04:41,870
The first one doesn't have a title,

84

00:04:41,880  -->  00:04:44,000
none of them have titles, I accessed that

85

00:04:44,010  -->  00:04:47,780
wrong? Posts, oh, posts title. There's the

86

00:04:47,790  -->  00:04:49,730
problem.

87

00:04:49,740  -->  00:04:52,880
Alright, let's refresh, there we go.

88

00:04:52,890  -->  00:04:54,200
So as you can see we got the title of

89

00:04:54,210  -->  00:04:57,470
each and the the text of each post

90

00:04:57,480  -->  00:04:59,180
as you can see right here. So what we're going

91

00:04:59,190  -->  00:05:00,830
to do is we're going to turn this into a

92

00:05:00,840  -->  00:05:06,140
link, a hyperlink, and we're going to send

93

00:05:06,150  -->  00:05:08,240
that through to another page. So let's go

94

00:05:08,250  -->  00:05:10,790
ahead and open up an a element here, let me put

95

00:05:10,800  -->  00:05:13,340
a space here, &lt;a href=

96

00:05:15,710  -->  00:05:31,460
"/post/{{ post . slug }}"

97

00:05:31,470  -->  00:05:33,890
and we're going to end that link right

98

00:05:33,900  -->  00:05:38,450
there. So let's go ahead and refresh, and

99

00:05:38,460  -->  00:05:39,980
refresh this and now you'll see that each

100

00:05:39,990  -->  00:05:43,550
one of these turned into a link and if I

101

00:05:43,560  -->  00:05:47,060
click on it, it goes to post/awesome-post-number-4

102

00:05:47,070  -->  00:05:51,590
for that one, post/index-test

103

00:05:51,600  -->  00:05:55,670
etc. And so this is going to we're

104

00:05:55,680  -->  00:05:57,350
going to build out this route in the next

105

00:05:57,360  -->  00:06:02,690
video.
