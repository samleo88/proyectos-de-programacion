1

00:00:02,470  -->  00:00:05,410
Alright, so, I figured out how we're going

2

00:00:05,410  -->  00:00:08,170
to do this and it's simple in concept it's

3

00:00:08,170  -->  00:00:09,670
just once we get a bunch of variables

4

00:00:09,670  -->  00:00:12,010
created it definitely gets bit confusing

5

00:00:12,010  -->  00:00:13,900
because there's only so many variables

6

00:00:13,900  -->  00:00:15,940
that you can use that sound relevant

7

00:00:15,940  -->  00:00:17,560
before you just run out of them and have

8

00:00:17,560  -->  00:00:19,900
to start using different variables. So,

9

00:00:19,900  -->  00:00:23,019
what we need to do is first create the

10

00:00:23,019  -->  00:00:26,560
resulting HP string, which is whatever

11

00:00:26,560  -->  00:00:30,189
out of whatever, so HP string is

12

00:00:30,189  -->  00:00:39,610
str(self.hp) + "/" + str(self.maxhp), and

13

00:00:39,610  -->  00:00:40,930
that's exactly what we were printing out

14

00:00:40,930  -->  00:00:42,850
before. So, let's print out hp

15

00:00:42,850  -->  00:00:50,590
string,

16

00:00:50,590  -->  00:00:53,290
and it's nine characters long so 4 plus

17

00:00:53,290  -->  00:00:57,100
4 and that, so the length is nine, so what we

18

00:00:57,100  -->  00:01:02,470
need to do is we need to set the variable

19

00:01:02,470  -->  00:01:04,330
that we're going to end up printing down

20

00:01:04,330  -->  00:01:06,160
here, so the variable that we've already

21

00:01:06,160  -->  00:01:08,200
figured out how many spaces we need to

22

00:01:08,200  -->  00:01:10,180
proceed it and put it in, so we're going to create a

23

00:01:10,180  -->  00:01:12,850
variable called current_HP which is

24

00:01:12,850  -->  00:01:14,740
right now going to be blank. That's what

25

00:01:14,740  -->  00:01:15,940
we're going to be stuffing everything

26

00:01:15,940  -->  00:01:19,960
that we need into including the hp string. So, if

27

00:01:19,960  -->  00:01:28,000
len(hp_string) &lt;

28

00:01:28,000  -->  00:01:30,369

29
9:

30

00:01:30,369  -->  00:01:33,729
we know that you know there's not nine

31

00:01:33,729  -->  00:01:36,399
digits there's probably eight, or if

32

00:01:36,399  -->  00:01:38,619
we're really lucky there's just you know

33

00:01:38,619  -->  00:01:43,090
six, but I haven't yet seen our

34

00:01:43,090  -->  00:01:47,140
hitpoints go below a hundred, so it's

35

00:01:47,140  -->  00:01:49,240
really going to be if it equals eight. So,

36

00:01:49,240  -->  00:01:53,050
what we need to do is we need to create

37

00:01:53,050  -->  00:01:57,850
a variable that contains how many digits

38

00:01:57,850  -->  00:01:59,410
it is left. So, we're going to go

39

00:01:59,410  -->  00:02:08,979
decreased = 9 - len(hp_string)

40

00:02:08,979  -->  00:02:13,450
and for instance if

41

00:02:13,450  -->  00:02:16,599
string was 8, so let's say we had 260

42

00:02:16,599  -->  00:02:18,819
points left, that would be equal to 1,

43

00:02:18,819  -->  00:02:21,640
decrease would be equal to 1. So,

44

00:02:21,640  -->  00:02:28,780
what we need to say is while decreased

45

00:02:28,780  -->  00:02:34,120
&gt; 0: we need to add a blank space to

46

00:02:34,120  -->  00:02:35,739
the beginning of current hp. So,

47

00:02:35,739  -->  00:02:40,090
current_hp += " " and then

48

00:02:40,090  -->  00:02:42,550
we need to remove one from the

49

00:02:42,550  -->  00:02:46,930
decreased, and at the end of that we need

50

00:02:46,930  -->  00:02:49,599
to set the current HP equal hp string,

51

00:02:49,599  -->  00:02:52,989
or well we need to add HP

52

00:02:52,989  -->  00:02:54,430
string to it. So, what it's going to do is

53

00:02:54,430  -->  00:02:57,010
current HP let's say now is one empty

54

00:02:57,010  -->  00:02:58,870
space that we're going to add onto that.

55

00:02:58,870  -->  00:03:02,180
So, current_hp +=

56

00:03:02,180  -->  00:03:07,909
the rest of the hp_string. Otherwise, if

57

00:03:07,909  -->  00:03:10,370
the length is not less than nine what

58

00:03:10,370  -->  00:03:13,099
we need to do is set current_hp

59

00:03:13,099  -->  00:03:18,049
=  hp_string. There we go.

60

00:03:18,049  -->  00:03:20,389
Now, what we're going to do is print out

61

00:03:20,389  -->  00:03:24,709
current_hp here, and this should work,

62

00:03:24,709  -->  00:03:28,250
let me go ahead and try it. So, we're

63

00:03:28,250  -->  00:03:30,530
just going to attack until

64

00:03:30,530  -->  00:03:34,400
we can see the top characters hitpoints fall below a

65

00:03:34,400  -->  00:03:38,120
thousand, which is the next attack here,

66

00:03:38,120  -->  00:03:41,120
so as you can see it did in fact work and it

67

00:03:41,120  -->  00:03:43,040
added one blank space to the beginning

68

00:03:43,040  -->  00:03:45,349
so that everything else lines up.

69

00:03:45,349  -->  00:03:49,010
We need to do the same thing for the MP

70

00:03:49,010  -->  00:03:53,269
bar as well. So, that's going

71

00:03:53,269  -->  00:03:54,439
to give me another

72

00:03:54,439  -->  00:03:58,280
opportunity to explain it I guess. So,

73

00:03:58,280  -->  00:04:01,459
mp_string is going to be equal to this,

74

00:04:01,459  -->  00:04:07,519
and then current_mp will be equal to a

75

00:04:07,519  -->  00:04:13,849
blank string. Now these are going to be

76

00:04:13,849  -->  00:04:16,849
seven characters long assuming that we

77

00:04:16,849  -->  00:04:20,840
have street digit magic points. So, if

78

00:04:20,840  -->  00:04:27,320
len(mp_string) &lt; 7:

79

00:04:27,320  -->  00:04:31,159
we know that we have maybe two digits. So,

80

00:04:31,159  -->  00:04:36,889
decreased = 7 - len(mp_string)

81

00:04:39,229  -->  00:04:41,990
And then

82

00:04:41,990  -->  00:04:49,280
while decreased &gt; 0: we're going to go

83

00:04:49,280  -->  00:04:54,889
current_mp += " " a blank space, then

84

00:04:54,889  -->  00:05:01,580
decreased -= 1 Then outside

85

00:05:01,580  -->  00:05:05,300
of this while loop we set current_mp to...

86

00:05:05,300  -->  00:05:09,620
well we add to it actually.

87

00:05:09,620  -->  00:05:12,830
+= mp_string

88

00:05:12,830  -->  00:05:20,870
else: current_mp = mp_string

89

00:05:20,870  -->  00:05:24,770
And then we need to implement that down here

90

00:05:24,770  -->  00:05:26,600
instead of current_mp it's going to say,

91

00:05:26,600  -->  00:05:31,220
well it is going to say current_mp, instead of all

92

00:05:31,220  -->  00:05:34,160
that string self mp stuff it's going to

93

00:05:34,160  -->  00:05:36,050
current_mp. So, let's go ahead and

94

00:05:36,050  -->  00:05:39,080
rerun this and let's use some magic, and

95

00:05:39,080  -->  00:05:44,210
we're going to use the strong meteor spell,

96

00:05:44,210  -->  00:05:45,980
and actually right off the bat it fell to under

97

00:05:45,980  -->  00:05:48,020
a hundred, and you see that the extra space

98

00:05:48,020  -->  00:05:55,180
was added there as well.
