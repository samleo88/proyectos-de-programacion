1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:08,880
So let's create a few utility classes to
get properties so "def get_hp(self):" we're just

2

00:00:08,880  -->  00:00:20,130
going to "return self.hp" "def get_max_hp(self): going to be the same except with the

3

00:00:20,130  -->  00:00:35,670
different property "return self.maxhp"
We're going to "def get_mp(self):" "return self.mp"

4

00:00:35,670  -->  00:00:45,480
and "def get_max_mp(self):" and going to be "return self.maxmp"

5

00:00:45,480  -->  00:00:54,360
So, what we're going to do now is
a way to when we cast a spell it's going

6

00:00:54,360  -->  00:01:00,960
to be able to generate spell damage and
then run this method on the enemy to

7

00:01:00,960  -->  00:01:06,420
reduce the enemy's MP, but we also need
to be able to reduce the magic points

8

00:01:06,420  -->  00:01:09,330
that we have because there's going to be
a cost.

9

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:13,290
So what we're going to do is we're just
going to define a function called

10

00:01:13,290  -->  00:01:24,509
"def reduce_mp(self, cost)" parameter and it's just going to

11

00:01:24,509  -->  00:01:29,460
reduce the cost so return,

12

00:01:29,460  -->  00:01:39,000
actually we don't need to return anything, so "self.mp -+ cost" Almost

13

00:01:39,000  -->  00:01:39,840
done,

14

00:01:39,840  -->  00:01:46,829
we've got a few more methods then we can start on the procedural stuff. So, we also

15

00:01:46,829  -->  00:01:50,939
need to get the spell name because we need to be able to return data to the user

16

00:01:50,939  -->  00:01:58,770
about what they've chosen, so we're going
to define a method called "def get_spell_name(self, i):"

17

00:01:58,770  -->  00:02:08,190
and pass it an index number, and we're
just going to "return self.magic[i]["name"]"

18

00:02:08,740  -->  00:02:21,430
as you can probably guess.
We're gonna get the spells MP costs as

19

00:02:21,430  -->  00:02:27,970
well, so "def get_spell_mp_cost(self, i):" We are also going to pass it an index there and

20

00:02:27,970  -->  00:02:40,840
we're going to "return self.magic[i]["cost"]"
I believe i've named that "cost." Let me go back

21

00:02:40,840  -->  00:02:41,650
here,

22

00:02:41,650  -->  00:02:51,400
yep. Alright, good stuff. So we need two
more methods, one to be able to choose an

23

00:02:51,400  -->  00:02:56,620
action like attack or magic, and then if
we choose magic we need a way to then

24

00:02:56,620  -->  00:03:07,990
choose the magic. So, we're gonna define
those two right here. So let's go ahead

25

00:03:07,990  -->  00:03:13,480
and create the first of those choice
options which is going to be action. So,

26

00:03:13,480  -->  00:03:20,800
"def choose_action(self):" we're not going to pass anything in here, we're just going

27

00:03:20,800  -->  00:03:28,060
to set an "i = 1" because we want
the option to start with 1.

28

00:03:28,060  -->  00:03:41,020
So then we're going to go "for item in self.actions:" "print" we need to convert

29

00:03:41,020  -->  00:03:53,110
the index number two string so that we
can do this "(str(i) + ":",  then we're just going to put

30

00:03:53,110  -->  00:04:01,870
"item)'" then we're going to increment "i += 1"

31

00:04:03,730  -->  00:04:09,010
Same kind of thing for choose magic
except it's going to also print out the

32

00:04:09,010  -->  00:04:22,300
cost of the magic. So, let's go ahead and
define choose spell, actually it's going to

33

00:04:22,300  -->  00:04:29,440
make more sense to "def choose_magic(self):" so we're using that word quite a bit in here and

34

00:04:29,440  -->  00:04:35,050
I don't want to forget what we're doing.
So index is going to be set to one "i = 1" as

35

00:04:35,050  -->  00:04:52,300
well, and "for spell in self.magic:" print
same thing we're going to convert the

36

00:04:52,300  -->  00:05:00,190
the index number to a string "print(str(i) +" going to concatenate it with a ":" then we're

37

00:05:00,190  -->  00:05:15,849
going to print out the spell name, and
then the cost. So ", spell["name"], "(cost:"

38

00:05:15,849  -->  00:05:31,510
", str(spell["mp"]) + ")")""

39

00:05:31,510  -->  00:05:42,880
Then we're going to also increment "i += 1" So, we're actually going to before we

40

00:05:42,880  -->  00:05:49,090
get the list of actions I guess we
should make it say what this relates to.

41

00:05:49,090  -->  00:05:56,800
So we're just going to "print("Actions")"
and then here we're going to

42

00:05:56,800  -->  00:05:59,800
"print("Magic")"

43

00:06:00,409  -->  00:06:06,439
So that is all we need for right now in
our class, so let's go ahead and get back

44

00:06:06,439  -->  00:06:13,279
on over to our main file here, and we're
going to generate an enemy as well.
