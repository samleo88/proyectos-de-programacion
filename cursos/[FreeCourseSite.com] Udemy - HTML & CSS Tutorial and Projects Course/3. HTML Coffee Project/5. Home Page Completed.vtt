WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:07.680
Right after the logo on the number we have the big background image as well as we have feature product

00:08.130 --> 00:14.910
where there's gonna be three products house blend French rose as well as Colombian rose and in each

00:14.910 --> 00:20.150
of them was gonna have some kind of link that will gonna go to Wikipedia.

00:20.150 --> 00:23.040
And as you can see it can open up in the new tab.

00:23.160 --> 00:27.910
Now at the very end we're gonna have here this whole paragraph with a copyright.

00:27.910 --> 00:32.180
Remember a special agent female character and then back to the tablet.

00:32.410 --> 00:35.060
So first of all let's start working on all this.

00:35.130 --> 00:41.970
So let's say there's a right after the navigation more or more we would like to get our first big image.

00:42.450 --> 00:43.260
So how do we do that.

00:43.980 --> 00:46.000
Well first of all we would need to get an image right.

00:45.990 --> 00:47.490
So we're gonna say I am G.

00:47.640 --> 00:49.490
And now we're looking for the source.

00:49.590 --> 00:55.370
And again we need to navigate the images folder and there we're gonna have our big background image.

00:55.380 --> 00:56.910
Now what else can we add here.

00:56.910 --> 01:03.240
Well let's say first that we would like to add alternative text and let's say coffee beans.

01:03.260 --> 01:04.200
And this is going to be met.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.860
Now as you notice right now the images are obviously big.

01:07.890 --> 01:09.960
We didn't adjust anything.

01:09.960 --> 01:14.660
And also let's check it out in the bigger browser window just so it's how it looks.

01:14.760 --> 01:19.360
Now as you can see there's two issues right now so for the smaller screen.

01:19.370 --> 01:21.260
Notice the image is way too big.

01:21.260 --> 01:24.500
However on a bigger screen it's not big enough.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.960
It's basically not spanning all across.

01:26.990 --> 01:32.720
Now in order to fix this usually with the work we had to assess however in our case since we haven't

01:32.720 --> 01:40.190
looked at the CSX we can do a tiny tiny little trick where remember we had the width and then previously

01:40.190 --> 01:43.640
will work with with only with pixels.

01:43.640 --> 01:48.530
When we were actually adding let's say hundred pixels here or something like this we also have an option

01:48.530 --> 01:49.850
of using the percentages.

01:50.450 --> 01:53.660
So instead of using pixels I'm going to add the hundred percent.

01:54.230 --> 01:57.440
And what happens right now the image is actually responsive.

01:57.440 --> 02:05.570
So notice on the small screen the image is exactly big enough for the whole screen instead of spanning

02:05.570 --> 02:06.900
it outside of the screen.

02:07.070 --> 02:09.950
And for the big screen notice.

02:09.950 --> 02:12.070
Now it's actually spanning all across.

02:12.080 --> 02:16.760
So essentially what we did is we made this image responsive again.

02:16.760 --> 02:22.430
Normally we're gonna do this within the CSX but again just because it's a little bit annoying I just

02:22.490 --> 02:23.310
add it here.

02:23.330 --> 02:28.930
This whatever two lines of code or with an attribute basically OK.

02:29.060 --> 02:30.110
Now what we have next.

02:30.110 --> 02:33.200
Well let's maybe create next a line break.

02:33.350 --> 02:39.490
Just so there there's some space in between and then I would like to start by placing having one.

02:39.500 --> 02:44.520
So I'm going to say had one and here on the right featured featured.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.460
Let's say product.

02:46.490 --> 02:48.110
So this is going to be my heading.

02:48.340 --> 02:54.530
Now after having one again let's add another windbreak and maybe right after the Lindberg let's start

02:54.530 --> 03:00.710
using the comments since there is gonna be three featured projects and all of them are going to be their

03:00.710 --> 03:01.340
own product.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.420
So I would have liked to have some kind of distinction of what is in there.

03:05.600 --> 03:11.200
So let's say first this is gonna be the house blend and for the house blend we'll start by heading to.

03:11.260 --> 03:18.230
So then add a hearing to right here and let's say house blend and we're gonna be looking for the coffee.

03:18.860 --> 03:19.860
Let me say this.

03:19.880 --> 03:22.550
And this is what I have here on the right hand side.

03:23.230 --> 03:27.880
Okay moving on I would like to place an image that I'm going to say image.

03:27.940 --> 03:30.640
Again we're gonna be looking for the source of the images.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.830
And now we have to look for the house.

03:33.250 --> 03:33.880
Now what else.

03:33.940 --> 03:39.760
Well we can always add the house blend like this and say that there's going to be alternative text.

03:40.030 --> 03:46.350
So if the images is not available or we can have displayed then there's gonna be alternative text.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.070
Now this is going to be my image.

03:48.070 --> 03:49.270
Now what else.

03:49.270 --> 03:55.000
Well I would like to have the paragraph let's say for the paragraph there is gonna be a text of I don't

03:55.000 --> 03:58.780
know twenty five words 50 words it doesn't really matter.

03:58.900 --> 04:04.720
Can just add some kind of power now the moment I'm gonna say this this is gonna look nice on the small

04:04.720 --> 04:05.480
screen right.

04:05.560 --> 04:09.360
As you can see right now however the issue is on a bigger screen.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.840
It is really annoying.

04:10.840 --> 04:17.050
If I see these lines like this again this is something we will gonna do would see SS But just because

04:17.200 --> 04:19.750
it does annoy me hell a lot.

04:19.750 --> 04:24.340
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add a new attribute that we haven't covered that yet and that is the

04:24.340 --> 04:25.370
style attribute.

04:25.480 --> 04:29.050
Again you're not going to use this later on once you learn to assess.

04:29.050 --> 04:31.570
But for now this is gonna help us a little bit.

04:31.660 --> 04:35.820
So within the assess this is basically a inline CSF.

04:36.050 --> 04:40.910
And again you don't need to remember this property you're going to learn it later on within the sense

04:40.990 --> 04:45.880
anyway but here I can just say with property and I'm gonna set it equal to 50 percent.

04:46.330 --> 04:51.920
So I'm going to say equals to 50 percent again please don't worry about the syntax for now.

04:52.150 --> 04:57.830
We all gonna cover this and say assessing this is a very very basic CSF syntax but it would involve

04:57.850 --> 05:01.550
gonna help us though because now I have my paragraph.

05:01.590 --> 05:06.350
It's only spanning 50 percent and it's going to look much more better on a bigger screen.

05:06.370 --> 05:07.780
Again it's really up to you.

05:07.870 --> 05:13.740
You can just skip this style attribute and just have the normal paragraph but I'm just going to chew

05:13.740 --> 05:15.360
it choose to do it this way.

05:16.090 --> 05:21.550
Then last but not least there's gonna be some type of link so I'm going to say having three and within

05:21.550 --> 05:25.240
the heading three I would like to have the link now for the link.

05:25.300 --> 05:30.850
Again we're gonna have to use some kind of attribute meaning the age of attribute where this link is

05:30.850 --> 05:37.660
gonna be going in our case we can either copy and paste it from the URL after we search for Wikipedia

05:38.070 --> 05:44.430
or since I know that this is gonna be my Euro I can write a really deep yes then two forward slashes

05:44.440 --> 05:52.660
then I believe W then we're looking for Vicky PDA Org so dot org and then let's add another forward

05:52.680 --> 06:00.850
site however since I would like to open this up in the new tab meaning I wouldn't want the user to navigate

06:00.850 --> 06:08.230
away from our page can you not target attribute and set it equal to underscore blank and let's call

06:08.230 --> 06:09.280
this details.

06:09.280 --> 06:14.200
So this would be the name of doing now once we save it what do we have.

06:14.670 --> 06:18.690
So we have our house blend and then we have also the details.

06:19.320 --> 06:22.010
So if we're going to click on a link not check it out what will go on.

06:22.650 --> 06:27.020
Well for now what's happening is that this is navigating away from our page.

06:27.180 --> 06:33.220
And the reason for that is as you can see I have a very small but at the end of the day very important

06:33.220 --> 06:37.730
error because this is not a target that should be target.

06:37.770 --> 06:40.900
As you can see how easy it is to make actually a mistake.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.590
Let me now get back maybe let me refresh.

06:43.590 --> 06:45.710
Just to make sure everything is working correct.

06:45.900 --> 06:49.950
And now we're opening up obviously in the correct Wikipedia.

06:49.980 --> 06:55.820
Now if you want to go any maybe further you can write coffee so maybe let's search in Wikipedia for

06:55.830 --> 06:58.890
coffee and then you are going to have a different URL.

06:58.980 --> 07:04.490
So maybe if you really like you can just copy and paste this your URL where you're gonna be for a coffee.

07:04.500 --> 07:05.540
No I'm not going to do that.

07:05.540 --> 07:10.920
I'm just gonna leave mine or the general Wikipedia but if you would like to do that obviously you just

07:10.920 --> 07:13.060
need to copy and paste this you know.

07:13.180 --> 07:13.950
Okay.

07:14.130 --> 07:15.380
So so far so good.

07:15.390 --> 07:20.030
So we have our first product our first feature product now next.

07:20.040 --> 07:24.870
What I would like to do is just copy and paste this because there's gonna be three of them.

07:24.870 --> 07:28.190
However I don't see the point of rewriting everything from scratch.

07:28.410 --> 07:34.020
If we can just copy and paste and create two more here I'm gonna say copy and we're going to copy and

07:34.020 --> 07:34.530
paste.

07:34.530 --> 07:37.700
So this is gonna be our I believe French Roast.

07:37.890 --> 07:40.870
And the last one is gonna be Colombia.

07:41.100 --> 07:47.330
Now once we are done with copying then we just need to start changing the values.

07:47.340 --> 07:54.180
So obviously here we're not gonna be looking for a house blend gonna be French roast.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.990
Then also the image we're gonna have to be different.

07:57.070 --> 08:05.250
So let's say that not a house with coffee French roast as well as remember image.

08:05.290 --> 08:10.300
So again let me look for the images and within the images we have the French Roast.

08:10.600 --> 08:15.870
And last but not least we have the alternative attribute French.

08:16.490 --> 08:17.190
Okay.

08:17.280 --> 08:23.830
That would be our second one and the last one a third but not the least one is gonna be our Colombian.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.290
But remember we can just keep this.

08:26.290 --> 08:27.940
However we would like.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.970
Meaning we can keep the link the same way.

08:30.970 --> 08:38.020
But you know what I would like to add though maybe two more line breaks after the end of the each of

08:38.020 --> 08:42.970
the items because I think is just gonna make a little bit more sense if they're going to be separated

08:42.970 --> 08:43.450
a little bit.

08:44.020 --> 08:46.740
So let me grab these two values here as well.

08:46.970 --> 08:50.350
Uh where we have Dan and I think it's right here.

08:50.350 --> 08:54.600
Let's copy these guys as well as at the end of the third link.

08:54.710 --> 08:57.110
And also just gonna add these line breaks.

08:57.280 --> 09:06.780
Like I said we still need to change this Colombian so Columbian bean and roast roast are.

09:06.940 --> 09:07.590
You know what.

09:07.630 --> 09:15.200
I can just maybe copy paste this maybe it's gonna be a little bit faster let me delete the title there.

09:15.210 --> 09:17.810
And we're also going to be looking for damage.

09:17.860 --> 09:24.080
So again I'm not a forward slash and sure enough we have Colombian and yeah I think the last thing just

09:24.080 --> 09:26.680
would be changing this alternative.

09:26.870 --> 09:33.230
Now what is that the very very end of our homepage that would be our simple paragraph.

09:33.350 --> 09:34.820
And let me show you again.

09:34.820 --> 09:36.840
Maybe we already forgot what you had.

09:36.890 --> 09:39.080
And by the way we can see right now.

09:39.080 --> 09:42.230
How old are page would look like on a bigger browser window.

09:42.590 --> 09:48.980
But at the very bottom we have our copyright 2019 and link back to the top.

09:49.610 --> 09:50.240
Okay.

09:50.330 --> 09:55.460
Now for the link back to the top maybe a little bit more line breaks here.

09:55.610 --> 09:58.270
Just because it's going to look a little bit better.

09:58.490 --> 10:04.810
And then here we're gonna have the paragraph within the paragraph there's gonna be copyright next.

10:04.880 --> 10:05.740
Let me save this.

10:05.750 --> 10:06.380
Let me show you.

10:06.380 --> 10:07.880
This is where we typing the paragraph.

10:08.450 --> 10:11.700
And then again let's use the special ed name character.

10:11.750 --> 10:12.860
Notice how.

10:12.890 --> 10:15.040
Remember it was the ampersand.

10:15.170 --> 10:16.270
Then the name of it.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.180
And in our case that was copy.

10:18.380 --> 10:22.210
And let's just say the year which would be 2019.

10:22.250 --> 10:26.610
Now if you're watching this in the future let's say 2000 whatever.

10:26.660 --> 10:30.160
Obviously right whatever year you're currently at.

10:30.230 --> 10:35.000
And last but not least we're all going to be looking forward to having having three that we'll going

10:35.000 --> 10:36.680
to include link back to the top.

10:37.220 --> 10:40.230
Now for the link again we're gonna have to have the trip.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.610
And then here we would need to navigate to a logo.

10:44.270 --> 10:50.890
So somewhere off the very top we're gonna have to create an I.D. or element with some kind of I.D. that's

10:50.900 --> 10:57.180
gonna match log and here let's just write back to to top.

10:57.260 --> 10:58.760
This is gonna be my text.

10:58.850 --> 11:03.230
Now what's happening right now is we don't have anything here that has the logo.

11:03.230 --> 11:06.080
I'm sorry the idea of Logo.

11:06.080 --> 11:10.990
So what I would like to do right now is for my image my logo image.

11:11.090 --> 11:16.420
I'm just gonna add the D and we're gonna set this equal to logo now moment.

11:16.430 --> 11:17.840
We're gonna save this.

11:17.840 --> 11:18.670
Check this out.

11:19.190 --> 11:22.730
I'm gonna scroll over and we're gonna click on it.

11:22.730 --> 11:28.140
We will gonna scroll all the way to the top so we're gonna navigate to the top of the page.

11:28.370 --> 11:34.470
And yeah we maybe should just check it out in a bigger browser window make sure that everything is working.

11:34.670 --> 11:36.470
Back to the top is fine.

11:36.500 --> 11:39.470
And now I can start working on our about page.
