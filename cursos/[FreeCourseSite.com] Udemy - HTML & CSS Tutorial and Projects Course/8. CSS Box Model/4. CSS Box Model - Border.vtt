00:00.180 --> 00:02.850
Last but not least we have the border.

00:02.970 --> 00:09.570
And again if we're checking our image we notice that the border is going to be around our edge.

00:09.570 --> 00:15.090
So who's going to be able to control how the border of our element looks like we're going to head over

00:15.090 --> 00:16.490
back to our sources.

00:16.710 --> 00:19.920
And let's start with having one now for sharing one again.

00:19.920 --> 00:25.990
We just need to type the border and then we'll going to have multiple options to choose from what we

00:25.990 --> 00:28.620
are looking for first is going to be border style.

00:29.010 --> 00:31.690
So what kind of style of the border is going to be.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.870
I'm not going to cover all these options.

00:33.870 --> 00:38.220
It doesn't make sense in most cases you are going to go probably with something like south.

00:38.850 --> 00:44.430
But we are going to look at I believe dashed or dated just to give you a kind of a taste of a different

00:44.430 --> 00:45.150
border.

00:45.180 --> 00:48.760
So first we're going to go with style and what kind of style of the border.

00:48.770 --> 00:52.140
This is going to be then the moment we're going to save it.

00:52.140 --> 00:57.910
Notice that I'm getting right now my solid border all around my own blossom.

00:57.930 --> 01:03.420
Everything is working fine and then we're going to be looking for the border and the property here is

01:03.420 --> 01:04.020
going to be with.

01:04.590 --> 01:06.810
So what would be the width of that border.

01:06.930 --> 01:09.270
Again we can use our yams.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.460
We can use the pixels.

01:11.460 --> 01:18.270
And I'm just gonna go with pixels and let's say I don't know ten pixels should cover.

01:18.540 --> 01:26.130
I have a black beautiful border around my head in one and probably the last one what I would like to

01:26.130 --> 01:32.230
show you is the fact of not only style not only with but we can change the color.

01:32.800 --> 01:36.820
I would say border color and then what we're looking for.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.840
Again we can use our G.B..

01:38.910 --> 01:42.860
We can use our GBI could use hex colors.

01:42.870 --> 01:48.700
We can use the Net color names whatever whatever you would like whatever your heart desires.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.700
In my case I'm gonna go with I don't know.

01:50.700 --> 01:54.990
Something like pink just so we can see better what's happening.

01:54.990 --> 02:01.310
And I think that is the best case because it's kind of bright let me do the yellow on which obviously

02:01.310 --> 02:03.120
also doesn't really work.

02:03.130 --> 02:04.240
I mean something.

02:04.340 --> 02:04.930
OK.

02:04.970 --> 02:07.120
The green one is going to work fine enough.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.110
One of those is gonna have this all around.

02:09.300 --> 02:10.060
Awesome.

02:10.520 --> 02:11.390
What we have next.

02:11.750 --> 02:18.410
Well next we would like to cover what happens if I don't want to type this just like this where each

02:18.410 --> 02:21.750
and every time I have the property done I look for value.

02:21.830 --> 02:26.030
So if we know already with padding and margin we have the shortcuts.

02:26.030 --> 02:28.700
What do you think that I'm trying to show you right now.

02:28.730 --> 02:34.430
I think you would probably guessing that there is some kind of a shorter version how we can write and

02:34.550 --> 02:40.610
sure enough there is no way we're going to write this we're going to save water and then the actual

02:40.640 --> 02:42.470
syntax here matters.

02:42.470 --> 02:44.490
So the order will gonna matter.

02:44.510 --> 02:47.590
So first we're gonna be looking for the width of the border.

02:47.960 --> 02:52.490
So let's say in my case we're gonna go with I don't know 10 pixels but you know let's change it.

02:52.490 --> 02:56.140
Otherwise you're gonna think that all the borders have to be ten pixels.

02:56.240 --> 03:00.410
So first is going to be the with that and we're gonna be looking for what kind of borders this is gonna

03:00.410 --> 03:00.910
be.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.900
So in our case this has been resolved and now we're looking for the color.

03:04.990 --> 03:06.140
Now what would be the color.

03:06.500 --> 03:06.860
I don't know.

03:06.860 --> 03:09.950
Let's try maybe a yellow one here.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.110
Let's say yellow.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.080
Excellent.

03:12.080 --> 03:16.140
We have our border and we didn't have to use all the property.

03:16.240 --> 03:21.020
Now there's also the option of let's say you don't want Borel around you're like looking at it in your

03:21.020 --> 03:21.790
listing.

03:21.830 --> 03:26.750
Well I have this specific element where I don't want the border all around how it can do this.

03:26.750 --> 03:30.790
Why he's just showing me all the options of all around the border.

03:30.890 --> 03:37.940
I mean no fear we can do that also to come and this out just so you can have the reference all three

03:37.940 --> 03:39.370
of them in the moment.

03:39.380 --> 03:40.170
I say it.

03:40.180 --> 03:41.480
Obviously there's no more.

03:41.510 --> 03:43.910
But we have the other options.

03:43.910 --> 03:50.360
And again I'm not gonna show you for each and every side but we can maybe test it out with let's say

03:50.360 --> 03:52.440
bottom let's red border.

03:52.550 --> 03:53.770
Now what we're looking for.

03:53.780 --> 03:57.020
Well we're looking for border and then the side we would like to stop.

03:57.660 --> 04:03.500
Let's say we're looking for border bottom style like I promised before we were going to look at different

04:03.500 --> 04:04.230
options.

04:04.340 --> 04:06.140
So let's go with dashed.

04:06.140 --> 04:07.990
Let's see how that is going to work out.

04:08.030 --> 04:15.200
Then we also have a thing for with so let's red border and you probably get the gist already bottom

04:15.800 --> 04:22.070
then the West is gonna be I don't know five pixels hopefully you're gonna be able to see and border

04:22.310 --> 04:24.710
bottom with or bottom color.

04:24.860 --> 04:28.120
Let's try hashtag let's say hashtag.

04:28.310 --> 04:28.700
I don't know.

04:28.700 --> 04:29.640
2 2 2.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.640
Let's see how this is gonna work out.

04:31.780 --> 04:35.250
And you and I have my nice dashboard.

04:35.540 --> 04:38.200
Now that is easy it says Box model.

04:38.290 --> 04:43.730
Again this is gonna be very important because you will gonna use it a lot whether it is for layout whether

04:43.730 --> 04:49.640
this is just gonna be for styling so if you're maybe not comfortable with some of these properties here

04:50.330 --> 04:55.720
maybe again rewind the videos practice a little bit more because you will gonna use this a lot.
