WEBVTT

00:00.110 --> 00:06.010
And I don't know why I was so eager to build the next section if we still haven't made this one responsive

00:06.420 --> 00:08.130
so we're going to head back over here.

00:08.340 --> 00:14.610
And we still need our media queries or we're going to say over here is we're going to say this is going

00:14.610 --> 00:21.330
to be a medium year and then we're going to say screen and then we're going to say and we're here we're

00:21.340 --> 00:24.280
all the same men with more here.

00:24.390 --> 00:29.390
And this is going to be 576 pixels like this.

00:29.460 --> 00:37.520
Then after that what you would want is skills center right and the parent skills center on this.

00:37.590 --> 00:39.330
And then we're going to say this play.

00:39.690 --> 00:42.380
I'm going to say flex I really like this.

00:42.450 --> 00:45.440
Then after that we're going to have a justified content.

00:45.660 --> 00:45.900
Right.

00:45.930 --> 00:53.050
And we're going to have a space between this and then we're going to have a flics rap rap.

00:53.110 --> 00:57.840
So when I say flex rap and I'm going to say rap I know this.

00:57.870 --> 01:00.310
Now if we say this let's check it out.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.140
We have.

01:01.440 --> 01:01.680
All right.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.900
So we say it over here and you can see it.

01:03.900 --> 01:05.230
Nothing has changed.

01:05.350 --> 01:07.410
Technically I don't worry about it.

01:07.410 --> 01:09.440
We actually we're going to do that right.

01:09.720 --> 01:16.160
So what's going to happen here with the skills and there right now we want to deal with the skill.

01:16.210 --> 01:23.190
So I'm going to say skill here and I'm going to say flex like we're here and I'm going to say again

01:23.730 --> 01:33.200
zero for growing zero for shrinking calculate and we're all going to say like this 50 percent 50 percent

01:33.570 --> 01:36.460
minus one E-M Warrior.

01:36.620 --> 01:43.670
All right then who would want to do is text align center text on line center here.

01:43.980 --> 01:47.770
We're going to say this and I know we're here for this skill paragraph.

01:47.770 --> 01:48.290
All right.

01:48.390 --> 01:50.310
We also want to make some changes.

01:50.460 --> 01:52.250
So I was just figuring out what we have so far.

01:52.250 --> 01:52.710
Right.

01:52.920 --> 01:57.450
So you can see where you are right now and text everything is in center but I want to move or hear this

01:57.450 --> 01:58.480
paragraph.

01:58.540 --> 02:06.200
So what I'm going to do here I'm going to say this is going to be scale paragraph way I like this and

02:06.190 --> 02:07.380
we're going to a margin.

02:07.430 --> 02:08.170
Zero.

02:08.180 --> 02:11.700
All right so now is going to be automatically in the middle.

02:11.700 --> 02:18.220
And you know what let's do with I to do like 80 percent 80 percent or here right.

02:18.300 --> 02:24.240
So I'm going to say this rewind this and once we refresh right now I can see that it's actually in the

02:24.240 --> 02:25.100
middle.

02:25.170 --> 02:30.510
Now one would also want to do is obviously once we get to the bigger screen we don't want it to be half

02:30.530 --> 02:31.190
the screen right.

02:31.220 --> 02:36.630
So we're going to have four of them four columns so we're going to go back over here and what we can

02:36.630 --> 02:40.890
do we can just copy and paste and we're going to change some values right.

02:40.920 --> 02:48.610
So we need to go back over here and here we're going to say for 9 9 2 0 9 and 2 pixels and on here this

02:48.790 --> 02:49.860
is the same.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.570
There's no difference or here.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.800
So we can just delete this.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.660
There's still going to be flex but oh we're here.

02:56.670 --> 03:03.540
Let's change this one to twenty five percent over here right then text the line again is the same one.

03:03.570 --> 03:04.560
So we don't care.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.590
Can we.

03:05.730 --> 03:08.480
But first gilds paragraph margin is going to be the same.

03:08.530 --> 03:09.730
Right but.

03:09.780 --> 03:11.530
So what can we do in this one.

03:11.580 --> 03:16.490
Well let's change this to 100 percent so we say this and let's check it out.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.160
We have.

03:17.380 --> 03:19.070
So we're fresh over here.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.150
I can see that this is going to be our look right.

03:21.180 --> 03:22.670
Once we get to that screen.

03:22.710 --> 03:23.130
Right.

03:23.220 --> 03:27.300
This is going to be a look then if we're in a smaller screen this is going to look like this.

03:27.660 --> 03:32.980
Or if we're actually making the screen bigger right you can see that it's a responsive.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.300
And now we actually have four of them.
