WEBVTT

00:00.590 --> 00:01.460
OK.

00:01.660 --> 00:06.340
We have the image that is in our local project so far so good.

00:06.370 --> 00:14.280
And what about if we're just gonna go on top of the image again let's use and three and let's say image.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.090
Oh you did me.

00:16.390 --> 00:17.440
You know I mean logo.

00:17.440 --> 00:18.670
Something like this again.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.350
We can write whatever we would like to.

00:21.450 --> 00:24.740
Now we have the ring three we have the image.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.110
What about the images.

00:26.160 --> 00:30.880
And we can directly access from the Web Okay let's think about it.

00:31.570 --> 00:38.920
So we have the image image has the attribute of the source and source points somewhere meaning in our

00:38.920 --> 00:46.420
case that would be to the same directory where we are working Can we maybe use the source and pointed

00:46.420 --> 00:49.120
to the image that is actually somewhere on the Web.

00:49.120 --> 00:52.650
Well it's just out first all have the having three.

00:52.690 --> 00:57.940
That would say image of youtube logo.

00:57.970 --> 00:58.990
Again we can name this.

00:58.990 --> 01:04.450
However we would like and now I can see with that I'm having three and having three and between them

01:04.450 --> 01:06.010
I have here this image.

01:06.780 --> 01:06.990
OK.

01:07.030 --> 01:07.750
Let's start out.

01:08.260 --> 01:11.940
So first of all again I'm going to open up the new browser window.

01:12.230 --> 01:15.230
Again I'm going to maximize this on what's right.

01:15.230 --> 01:19.550
YouTube not dot com logo.

01:19.930 --> 01:25.780
Then let's specifically say that we're looking for image and in this case would you like to do instead

01:25.780 --> 01:28.480
of using save us that we did before.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.270
Remember we used save images.

01:30.730 --> 01:35.670
Now we can have an option of copy image address so let's click on this.

01:35.710 --> 01:42.130
Now the address is gonna be copied to our clipboard and we can head over vectoring the amount we can

01:42.130 --> 01:45.130
again create a new image element.

01:45.250 --> 01:51.580
And in this case within the source let's copy and paste whatever we're getting back from our clipboard.

01:51.580 --> 01:58.270
Now the annoying thing is gonna be this that obviously this path is so long.

01:58.300 --> 02:03.070
So again I'll tell you right away this is gonna be very annoying whenever you're gonna be getting something

02:03.070 --> 02:04.720
like this from the web.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.110
So unfortunately this is how it is.

02:07.360 --> 02:15.470
But we can write over here it may be for alternative you to a logo or something like this.

02:15.460 --> 02:17.560
Again we just want to quickly see it and that's it.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.470
And sure enough everything works fine.

02:20.470 --> 02:27.320
We have our image but annoying part would be the fact that source would be displayed like this.

02:27.400 --> 02:33.730
So far as you can see it pretty much we would need to spend like three minutes just scroll up and see

02:33.730 --> 02:36.940
all the source that is starting here at the very top.
