WEBVTT

00:00.080 --> 00:07.000
And the next section is going to be building is going to be a forum section or so you can see or subscribe.

00:07.260 --> 00:10.230
And then we have your email and submit.

00:10.490 --> 00:15.960
So we're going to go back over here and this is the main assess but we're going to start obviously with

00:16.060 --> 00:17.010
HDMI.

00:17.340 --> 00:23.310
So here again we're going to do the same thing we're going to say this is going to be a form section.

00:23.360 --> 00:24.020
Right.

00:24.090 --> 00:28.560
Then select a line and copy and paste the line here we're going to write.

00:28.560 --> 00:32.190
And this is going to be end of form section.

00:32.220 --> 00:38.730
Then after that you'd want a section on it and we're going to say idea or here and then we're going

00:38.730 --> 00:39.800
to say form.

00:40.060 --> 00:44.380
Then once we have this then we're going to have a forum content.

00:44.460 --> 00:49.790
So I'm going to say class and this is going to be a form of content or likeness.

00:49.990 --> 00:57.990
Then within this day of the forum and then we're going to have a heading when we're here with the class

00:58.110 --> 00:59.060
of worm.

00:59.210 --> 01:07.890
We're going to say title or here within this title we're all going to have a subscribe here.

01:08.140 --> 01:16.150
So when you say some scribe I'm going to say here first time over here and I actually realize this.

01:16.290 --> 01:22.360
Now we have a heading one then after that we would actually want to create a forum.

01:22.430 --> 01:25.050
So we're then still the foreign content.

01:25.050 --> 01:27.070
We're going to save one more here.

01:27.150 --> 01:32.180
Now we're not going to have any action here so just delete this right away.

01:32.340 --> 01:38.310
And this is going to be put then over here we're going to press tab and type is going to be e-mail then

01:38.400 --> 01:39.250
ID.

01:39.390 --> 01:42.810
We're also going to say e-mail e-mail.

01:42.820 --> 01:44.890
Then after that we will have placeholder.

01:44.890 --> 01:46.860
This is going to be your e-mail.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.720
So let's say another name on here.

01:49.730 --> 01:54.090
E-mail e-mailed here and the placeholder.

01:54.140 --> 02:00.390
Right so this is what's going to be written inside the box relaying this and I'm going to say your e-mail

02:01.140 --> 02:05.240
you this and then we'll get our input right here.

02:05.250 --> 02:13.130
So next input again time and again this is going to be sub met then or here we're going to have a type

02:13.880 --> 02:16.890
and type is going to be a submit.

02:17.000 --> 02:25.880
So type sub met here and then we're going to have a value and the value is going to be submit sub me

02:26.430 --> 02:27.560
like this.

02:27.560 --> 02:28.160
All right.

02:28.160 --> 02:36.830
So once we have here our inputs in the aged you know I'll go ahead and let's actually move to see assess

02:36.830 --> 02:37.990
and start dialing.

02:38.190 --> 02:44.900
So I'm going to say this and go back to main sources here and you can see already created a comment.

02:45.190 --> 02:45.440
All right.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.580
So this is going to be a forum section over here.

02:48.580 --> 02:51.000
First things first of all going to say like this.

02:51.020 --> 02:51.710
All right.

02:51.710 --> 02:57.280
First all going to say that for the actual form or here like this we would want.

02:57.280 --> 02:57.670
All right.

02:57.700 --> 03:02.410
We're going to mean right into this is going to be the height for the whole thing.

03:02.440 --> 03:07.410
This is going to be 60 new heights or here and I can see what happened right.

03:07.430 --> 03:13.160
Right away I have 60 units that are going to have a background here and I'm going to we're going to

03:13.160 --> 03:18.470
use a image so I'm going to say you know we're not phantasm.

03:18.640 --> 03:24.060
And so I'm going to say Menges then within the images we're going to look for filler on it.

03:24.110 --> 03:25.870
So this is going to be our first one.

03:26.110 --> 03:29.020
And like before we're going to add right away linear great.

03:29.310 --> 03:37.000
So I'm going to say lean here gradient here and then we'll have parentheses karma.

03:37.290 --> 03:40.890
And here we're going to have R G B R G B.

03:41.010 --> 03:47.870
And this is going to be again 0 0 0 point let's say 5.

03:48.030 --> 03:48.740
Right.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.690
And then on here we'll do the same thing.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.660
Right so our GPA.

03:52.730 --> 03:56.100
Zero zero zero point five.

03:56.290 --> 03:59.590
Right now we added a dark overlay.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.590
Then after that we want a background attachment.

04:02.770 --> 04:09.520
So I'm going to say background and or here to see attachment and that's going to be fixed right again

04:09.520 --> 04:15.210
and we're going to cradle here this parallax effect right where the text is actually going to be moving

04:15.570 --> 04:17.530
and the image is going to stay fixed.

04:17.910 --> 04:24.780
Then we're going to have a background position center background or her position and say Sandra Oh I

04:24.790 --> 04:32.010
don't like this then we're going to have a background repeat background repeat and want to say no repeat

04:32.700 --> 04:37.470
then we'll have a background color or hair color size.

04:37.570 --> 04:40.910
So size is going to be cover like this.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.900
I'm going to we're going to have a clip.

04:43.260 --> 04:49.200
So again we're going to just make it or we're like this slanted and you see or hear and then how are

04:49.200 --> 04:49.860
you going to do that.

04:49.860 --> 04:51.010
We're going to say we're here.

04:51.220 --> 04:53.320
Clip here.

04:53.460 --> 04:57.140
Path it and I know he'll get it right.

04:57.140 --> 05:04.180
Polygon are they going here hear this and we're going to start here by zero.

05:04.460 --> 05:10.190
Then we'll get our 15 percent then we're going to have 100 percent more here than will have zero.

05:10.190 --> 05:13.870
So 100 percent zero we're this.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.200
Then we're going to have another 100 percent like this.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.260
And this is going to be 85 percent.

05:21.290 --> 05:22.880
All right now we're just starting.

05:22.880 --> 05:23.690
All right.

05:23.870 --> 05:27.160
So we have 0 15 on here like this.

05:27.230 --> 05:30.150
Then we have a hundred and zero.

05:30.440 --> 05:35.190
So basically what I'm saying is this one is slanted because of this 15.

05:35.380 --> 05:35.960
Well here right.

05:35.960 --> 05:39.970
This is the one that controls it out here you can see where I have it zero.

05:39.980 --> 05:41.030
It's not going to be sliding.

05:41.030 --> 05:42.170
This is 15.

05:42.530 --> 05:45.290
Then over here we want to control this one little bit.

05:45.290 --> 05:45.920
Right.

05:45.940 --> 05:48.510
So here we're going to say hundred and eighty five.

05:48.780 --> 05:53.140
And are you going to say zero 100 percent.

05:53.140 --> 05:53.480
All right.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.040
So this is how it's going to look like.

05:55.220 --> 05:56.960
So here we're going to have it line.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.550
And over here we're going to have a line.

05:58.790 --> 06:03.880
And what we're going to do over here we're going to have a display flex because we want to see or hear

06:03.900 --> 06:05.050
this text right.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.360
It has disappeared right now.

06:06.520 --> 06:14.690
So I want to play it or hear some say display flex like this and we're going to say justify content.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.630
And we're going to say center right.

06:16.670 --> 06:24.980
So first you can put it horizontally and then let's do vertically so line items and we're going to say

06:24.980 --> 06:29.050
Center right now is sitting exactly in the center.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.720
So then we're going to want to work with foreign title.

06:32.720 --> 06:37.730
So I'm going to say for one hand over here and what would be the rules.

06:37.930 --> 06:44.370
Well first of all I would want text align center text on line center on this right.

06:44.500 --> 06:49.630
Then I would actually want a color and I'm going to say colored is going to be white.

06:49.630 --> 06:53.870
So have five F3 F4 on this.

06:53.940 --> 07:03.640
Then we're going to do a margin 0 top 0 right 40 pixels bottom and we're going to zero.

07:04.080 --> 07:09.380
And then we're going to have a font size here this is going to be 40 pixels.

07:09.380 --> 07:14.980
Well this right tool you can see over here that actually getting a 40 pixels font size.

07:15.280 --> 07:18.640
And then now I want a text here.

07:18.740 --> 07:22.060
Transform and we're going to say uppercase right here.

07:22.060 --> 07:25.410
Now you can see that it's actually transfer to abrogates.

07:25.420 --> 07:30.060
Then over here we're going to have a hash tag e-mail e-mail.

07:30.160 --> 07:30.880
We're here right.

07:30.910 --> 07:32.510
So this would be the other one.

07:32.620 --> 07:39.970
And we're really going to say or your border first of all going to say more and none of this will have

07:40.060 --> 07:45.150
a background and we're going to have a transparent transparent background right.

07:45.190 --> 07:49.370
Because you can see that and first of all I want to get rid of the border more then I want to give you

07:49.390 --> 07:52.460
the background and then I'm actually going to start dialing.

07:52.480 --> 07:57.920
So here I'm going to say border bottom and we're going to say three pixels solid.

07:57.940 --> 08:03.550
And again we're going to use a hashtag have five have three and five.

08:03.990 --> 08:04.920
All right.

08:04.960 --> 08:10.810
So this is going to be our hair our color and we're going to have fun size and let's say we're here

08:10.820 --> 08:12.800
this is going to be 30 pixels.

08:12.800 --> 08:13.030
Right.

08:13.030 --> 08:20.970
So font size get bigger then we'll have a margin 10 pixels or here and 20 pixels.

08:21.040 --> 08:21.800
So here like.

08:21.820 --> 08:26.560
So we had a lot of margin and monocytes margin right.

08:26.650 --> 08:33.420
So let's keep on moving and let's actually what we would want to do is we would want to deal here with

08:33.660 --> 08:34.720
e-mail placeholder.

08:34.740 --> 08:35.150
Right.

08:35.470 --> 08:37.160
Because you can see that nothing appears that way.

08:37.180 --> 08:37.430
Right.

08:37.450 --> 08:43.200
Well maybe it does mean it's kind of hard for us to see what we need to do is actually target this placeholder.

08:43.390 --> 08:47.460
So I'm going to say hashtag email email here.

08:47.530 --> 08:51.380
We're going to do that and we're going to have a placeholder like this.

08:51.640 --> 08:55.980
And then we're going to have a caller and this is going to be hot color hash tag.

08:56.150 --> 08:59.680
EF 5 EF 3 5 when you like this.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.420
And then you can see that text is showing.

09:01.420 --> 09:07.860
So now we do a text transform and let's do capitalize on this.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.020
Right now we have our text.

09:10.380 --> 09:14.780
And next we're going to work with a submit button here.

09:14.910 --> 09:15.930
So let's do here.

09:15.960 --> 09:20.430
Let's work with the submit button and we're going to say we're here like this.

09:20.430 --> 09:21.570
All right so I'm going to say we're here.

09:21.570 --> 09:27.030
Hash tag sub met here and are we all going to see this play.

09:27.090 --> 09:29.230
We're going to see inline block.

09:29.700 --> 09:34.890
First of all again when we want it to be displayed inline block then the background we're going to say

09:34.890 --> 09:42.780
transparent or hearing this background transparent border I'm going to say we're here and this is going

09:42.780 --> 09:45.350
to be three pixels solid.

09:45.510 --> 09:56.900
And this is going to be white and it's going to say 5 3 5 5 have three or five like this then after

09:56.900 --> 10:04.820
that one is actually double check whether we have an idea of what I write because or here type you can

10:04.820 --> 10:06.240
see that I don't have an ID.

10:06.290 --> 10:07.850
That's why it wasn't working right.

10:08.030 --> 10:09.230
I had two types are here.

10:09.230 --> 10:16.400
So now I submit that Id submit and that's always usually occurs if you don't notice it working right.

10:16.470 --> 10:21.530
So if you're doing something in a live preview and brackets and it's not showing up here it's probably

10:21.650 --> 10:24.100
something with a class or ID.

10:24.110 --> 10:26.550
Now we have a border of their border.

10:26.540 --> 10:29.170
We were planning 10 pixels.

10:29.180 --> 10:29.640
All right.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.580
Thirty pixels on this.

10:31.610 --> 10:34.930
Right now I can see where it's moving to the next line or any.

10:34.980 --> 10:41.240
Then once we have this was going to be font size font size is going to be twenty five pixels like this

10:41.860 --> 10:44.890
that we're going to have text transform.

10:45.030 --> 10:48.600
This is going to be uppercase like this color.

10:48.770 --> 10:49.730
We're going to have hash that.

10:49.760 --> 10:54.730
F f c 9 1 for one like this.

10:54.920 --> 11:02.130
And then we'll have a margin here 10 pixels like this and 20 pixels like this.

11:02.160 --> 11:08.810
Now we have this knowledge and transition some large margin top and bottom and 10 sides is going to

11:08.810 --> 11:09.510
be 20.

11:09.740 --> 11:16.030
And here we're going to say I like this transition transition transition and it's going to be color.

11:16.190 --> 11:17.980
And again we'll do the same spiel.

11:17.990 --> 11:18.230
Right.

11:18.230 --> 11:27.540
So I say color 2 seconds ease then background we're here two seconds ease and border.

11:27.830 --> 11:30.420
Two seconds two seconds.

11:30.470 --> 11:33.760
Now once we have this let's do a submit hover.

11:33.980 --> 11:38.550
So to say here sub segment right.

11:38.570 --> 11:41.410
I don't want to say however this.

11:41.490 --> 11:50.750
And once we have that let's do a color as EF 3 EF 5 and this background here.

11:50.830 --> 12:00.470
Then let's do a hash tag F F and this is when we see 9:1 for here and then we have a border color border

12:01.340 --> 12:03.780
color here like this right.

12:03.780 --> 12:09.240
So more color would want is border color.

12:09.310 --> 12:12.160
That's why I'm struggling with the color again.

12:12.210 --> 12:16.330
Hashtag f f c 9:24.

12:16.430 --> 12:18.440
So everything is pretty much going to be.

12:18.680 --> 12:23.570
So I'm going to go back over here and let's write soon as I'm hovering You can see that it's going to

12:23.570 --> 12:29.190
be changing right now right for the hover and the last thing that actually would want to do is with

12:29.200 --> 12:31.400
me to show you how it would look on a bigger screen.

12:31.520 --> 12:33.820
Why we would be doing this right.

12:33.860 --> 12:36.710
So you're hearing we have subscribe here.

12:36.730 --> 12:37.480
Email right.

12:37.500 --> 12:40.920
But you can see the map line up exactly correctly right.

12:40.970 --> 12:44.530
You can see that because of the paddings and margins they're not even.

12:44.780 --> 12:46.160
So what we can do here.

12:46.400 --> 12:51.950
We're going to say we're a very simple form and over here we're going to say this play and we're going

12:51.950 --> 12:54.270
to say flex right.

12:54.590 --> 12:56.410
Right away lined up correctly.

12:56.420 --> 13:01.100
Now the problem is if we go to the smaller screen they're actually going to be doing this right.

13:01.190 --> 13:05.290
You can see that they're actually you know this this is not a good look.

13:05.710 --> 13:06.360
What do we need.

13:06.380 --> 13:09.270
Again these flex rap rap.

13:09.380 --> 13:12.450
And we're going to do rap and right away you can see it's rapping.

13:12.650 --> 13:17.360
And now all the bargain paddings and margins actually make a little bit more sense.

13:17.360 --> 13:17.970
Right.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.840
And now we can just say this one over here right.

13:20.930 --> 13:24.950
And we can go and check it out when we have a recording.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.350
We refresh.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.070
Right.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.840
And this is the look that we have.
