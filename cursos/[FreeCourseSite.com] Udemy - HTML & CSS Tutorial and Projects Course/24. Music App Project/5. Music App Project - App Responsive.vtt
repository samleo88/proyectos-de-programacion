WEBVTT

00:00.030 --> 00:01.640
Go for this section.

00:01.740 --> 00:05.290
As we're moving let's actually open up our own.

00:05.310 --> 00:05.580
Right.

00:05.580 --> 00:08.040
So this is already finished version right.

00:08.040 --> 00:10.740
Let's open up the file that we're actually working on.

00:11.010 --> 00:15.790
And so if I'm going to go here and in this nation you know and this is going to be here years ago.

00:15.840 --> 00:16.390
Right.

00:16.420 --> 00:18.250
So this is what we have so far.

00:18.440 --> 00:18.910
All right.

00:18.990 --> 00:20.880
Does it matter how I'm scrolling right.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.690
This is always going to look like this.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.390
And that's not something that we want.

00:24.390 --> 00:24.990
Right.

00:25.050 --> 00:31.020
So what we're going to do here is we're going to go back to see assess and we're going to apply some

00:31.020 --> 00:31.320
rules.

00:31.320 --> 00:31.560
Right.

00:31.560 --> 00:35.120
And this section is going to be probably the most interesting right.

00:35.130 --> 00:40.530
But also most challenging because there's going to be a lot of things to worry about.

00:40.530 --> 00:41.110
Right.

00:41.130 --> 00:44.150
So here we're going to say media I'm not going to say screen.

00:44.310 --> 00:47.280
So basically we're saying only when the screen changes the side.

00:47.340 --> 00:52.070
Right here we're going to say men with here.

00:52.110 --> 00:54.140
776.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.670
Right so 776 pixels.

00:56.730 --> 01:03.140
And once we have this one over here we would want to say that side have real links right.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.620
And remember these links right.

01:04.620 --> 01:11.160
By default they were just plain and because we wanted to work with this oh here button right now what

01:11.160 --> 01:17.600
I would want to do here is site nav links and what I'm going to say we're here display.

01:17.870 --> 01:18.170
Right.

01:18.210 --> 01:25.380
And block but because this button is actually clicking it right and it is actually hiding.

01:25.410 --> 01:26.140
Right.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.590
Not only we need the right side display.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.110
Block we also need to write important.

01:31.340 --> 01:31.850
Right.

01:31.940 --> 01:33.570
And then for sure we all are writing.

01:33.580 --> 01:34.170
So right.

01:34.260 --> 01:38.730
Because otherwise I write it if we're going to hide it with the button we're not going to be able to

01:38.730 --> 01:39.260
see.

01:39.460 --> 01:39.880
All right.

01:39.990 --> 01:41.160
So let's see how it works.

01:41.160 --> 01:41.680
Right.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.910
So as I go to the bigger screen right.

01:43.970 --> 01:45.090
Let me refresh.

01:45.090 --> 01:47.250
You can see the links are always going to be here.

01:47.270 --> 01:47.790
All right.

01:47.850 --> 01:52.950
Once I go through the smaller ones that display not right again if I'm going to let's say between this

01:52.950 --> 01:59.380
important point here and let's refresh right now we can see that it said the links would be gone.

01:59.550 --> 02:02.640
All right so I'm going to hide the links in here like this.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.990
Once we go to the bigger screen they're not appearing.

02:05.130 --> 02:06.980
I mean this is the reasoning for this.

02:06.980 --> 02:08.220
Important.

02:08.220 --> 02:14.340
All right so we're going to say we're here important then once we have the important now what we would

02:14.340 --> 02:17.660
want is a side button to actually be gone.

02:17.670 --> 02:17.890
Right.

02:17.910 --> 02:19.530
So this guy we don't need it anymore.

02:19.820 --> 02:23.270
So we're going to say on our side between.

02:23.460 --> 02:27.180
And we're going to say this play I'm going to say on here like this.

02:27.180 --> 02:27.600
All right.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.790
So if we're going to go to the bigger screen.

02:30.210 --> 02:32.610
Sure enough we can see that this one is gone right.

02:32.650 --> 02:39.290
So the links always appear right but the button is actually gone right now after that we would want

02:39.290 --> 02:43.900
is you remember this The button called the nav button we actually would want.

02:43.980 --> 02:49.140
It's all going to say now have BT and we're going to say this display and we're going to say block or

02:50.170 --> 02:50.860
like this.

02:50.870 --> 02:51.600
Right.

02:51.690 --> 02:53.800
So again we have it over here right.

02:53.980 --> 02:55.680
And you can see the button.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.380
Right.

02:56.460 --> 02:58.030
So everything is work.

02:58.080 --> 03:03.110
Now remember when we said this as flex direction column for the whole body.

03:03.150 --> 03:06.480
Now for the bigger screen is actually going to change this.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.910
I'm going to say body and I'm going to say men right.

03:09.930 --> 03:16.850
And again we're going to do a hundred View Heights like this this play and we're going to say flex like

03:16.860 --> 03:17.610
this.

03:17.650 --> 03:22.350
However now we're going to change the flex directional direction.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.300
I'm going to say roll it right.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.260
And let's see what we have there.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.300
Fresh right.

03:27.450 --> 03:33.640
You can see that I'm slowly but surely starting to get over here and to look that out right now.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.860
The next one wouldn't be side in half.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.580
I remember the first deciding that was this guy.

03:38.590 --> 03:39.550
All right.

03:39.560 --> 03:49.950
So I'm going to ride side of here and I'm going to say flex and 0 0 0 shrink and 20 percent or hear

03:49.950 --> 03:55.830
basis on here I'm right then I'm going to say men height 100 new heights.

03:55.840 --> 03:56.100
All right.

03:56.110 --> 04:01.630
So we always made him across a whole screen and the background we're going to say like this.

04:01.640 --> 04:10.100
This is going to be c c 9 and C I want to say right now refresh.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.280
Now I can see what we have all right.

04:12.450 --> 04:19.050
Now we got first outside now or here right now the questioning or here is this border or right.

04:19.080 --> 04:25.800
So maybe the actual value messed up or here maybe added some little paddings or here or something like

04:25.800 --> 04:26.490
this right.

04:26.490 --> 04:27.990
So we're going to figure this one out.

04:28.010 --> 04:30.310
Right so how to get them actually even.

04:30.390 --> 04:36.370
So we're going to do more here than often the sign of what we would want is to work with the main.

04:36.690 --> 04:38.910
So we decided now was the first.

04:38.920 --> 04:39.730
All right.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.530
Now we need to deal with me.

04:41.820 --> 04:44.420
So here with the main We're going to say like this.

04:44.430 --> 04:44.790
Right.

04:44.950 --> 04:53.420
So I'm going to say flex this and for the flex I'm going to say this is going to be 0 0 80 percent.

04:53.590 --> 04:55.970
When you doing this display.

04:56.250 --> 05:02.430
And we're actually going to say flex on here like this but display flex is going to be column.

05:02.580 --> 05:06.450
So I'm going to say flex direction and that's going to be column.

05:06.630 --> 05:11.310
So basically what's going to happen I'm going to make sure that they're stacking one one on top of each

05:11.310 --> 05:11.690
other.

05:11.700 --> 05:14.100
This guy is Guy and oranges guy.

05:14.140 --> 05:14.760
All right.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.550
So here let's refresh and let's see what we have so far.

05:17.550 --> 05:18.170
All right.

05:18.180 --> 05:20.160
So this is what we have so far.

05:20.160 --> 05:27.420
Then after that what we would want is logo container plays this logo here in the center because this

05:27.420 --> 05:28.910
is what we have here.

05:28.950 --> 05:35.990
So what are going to have over here is we're going to have a logo here logo.

05:36.240 --> 05:42.270
And we're going to say container like this and we're going to say justify content.

05:42.480 --> 05:48.440
And this is going to be center here and then or here the last thing that we would want to do is have

05:48.570 --> 05:51.230
a class of margin right.

05:51.390 --> 05:58.100
And this class of margin is going to be margin left and this is going to be negative 20 percent.

05:58.110 --> 06:01.040
Now why I'm adding this class of negative percent.

06:01.050 --> 06:03.970
So basically what I want is set up to query.

06:04.020 --> 06:11.610
So the moment I press this button this side I was going to get all of this margin class more here and

06:12.120 --> 06:17.600
it's going to go actually over here and the actual body.

06:17.600 --> 06:18.660
All right.

06:18.780 --> 06:21.110
The main is actually going to grow.

06:21.250 --> 06:21.800
Right.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.130
This is what I want right some this.

06:24.210 --> 06:25.860
This will be what I would want.

06:25.860 --> 06:34.890
However there is a little bit of issue right because we're working with here with a curso or curso and

06:34.890 --> 06:36.800
it's using absolute values.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.820
We also need to add over here something like this right.

06:39.980 --> 06:46.690
What we would need to have is Max with and we're going to say 80 with you.

06:46.830 --> 06:47.370
Right.

06:47.460 --> 06:54.990
Because otherwise if we're if we don't say this right our counsel is going to be spending very very

06:54.990 --> 06:56.550
long on the site.

06:56.680 --> 07:00.600
And so basically it's going to be using all the space and we're going to have to do a lot of scrolling.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.150
All right.

07:01.230 --> 07:02.390
So here we need to right.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.470
Important.

07:03.660 --> 07:04.630
So far right.

07:04.830 --> 07:11.210
For this main to that is important if you're going to be using now if you're not using Elgar's all doesn't

07:11.220 --> 07:11.930
matter.

07:11.970 --> 07:18.720
But if you're using all curso this is the way to actually make sure that our carrousel is not doing

07:18.720 --> 07:23.970
the scrolling effect right where you have basically you can scroll for like ages to actually get to

07:23.970 --> 07:24.600
the center.

07:24.650 --> 07:25.060
Right.

07:25.140 --> 07:29.870
Because they're using the absolute values and we are using the flex values right.

07:29.910 --> 07:31.480
So there's a difference here.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.100
Right now we're here.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.030
Let's deal first with this marginal.

07:35.130 --> 07:35.680
Right.

07:35.700 --> 07:38.760
So here we're going to have a margin left.

07:38.760 --> 07:45.450
Now what I would also wouldn't want to do right is to have a little bit of another class right which

07:45.450 --> 07:46.950
would be transition.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.050
But let's maybe do first the script.

07:49.050 --> 07:51.590
All right let's add this these classes.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.430
All right.

07:52.650 --> 07:54.580
So I'm going to go to my script.

07:54.780 --> 07:58.270
Now I would need to add a few more Javascript rules or.

07:58.350 --> 07:59.220
Right.

07:59.340 --> 08:05.380
So here first what I'm going to say is that this was a side and so I'm going to make a common side.

08:05.390 --> 08:11.600
Now I've signed button and I've been doing this because I messed up right.

08:11.820 --> 08:15.430
So this is going to be signed between now.

08:15.480 --> 08:20.500
This was the rule for this I'd be you know here we're going to write a Nav. median.

08:20.690 --> 08:21.270
Right.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.760
And what we were going to write over here.

08:23.250 --> 08:28.040
First of all going to say on here that this is going to be Dollar Sign here and this is going to be

08:28.220 --> 08:33.390
have between one second look at something should happen.

08:33.420 --> 08:40.620
So I'm going to say we're here click that console click here and I'm going to say function and the function

08:40.620 --> 08:47.820
is going to be print and curly braces right then I'm going to say Dollar Sign here like this and I'm

08:47.820 --> 08:50.080
going to say side now.

08:50.250 --> 08:54.580
And because once I click the button the first thing that I would want to do is do something with the

08:54.580 --> 08:55.140
site now.

08:55.170 --> 08:55.790
Right.

08:55.860 --> 09:01.620
So here I'm going to say right now and we're going to say we're here and this is going to be a doggle

09:01.890 --> 09:03.350
class.

09:03.660 --> 09:07.210
So we're going to say toggle class and the class is going to be margin.

09:07.420 --> 09:09.550
I remember this class is going to be created.

09:09.660 --> 09:09.900
Right.

09:09.900 --> 09:13.040
The last one or here this morning class or here like this.

09:13.070 --> 09:13.750
Right.

09:14.250 --> 09:18.540
So what's going to happen is when we're going to toggle this class of margin.

09:18.810 --> 09:21.410
So what's this one here.

09:21.480 --> 09:22.980
Let's go to the bigger screen.

09:23.280 --> 09:27.230
Let's refresh and let's see what we have right now we can see what happens.

09:27.380 --> 09:27.640
Right.

09:27.690 --> 09:30.300
Every time I click it it actually disappears.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.850
Right now there's two important things right.

09:32.850 --> 09:40.160
First we need to make sure that this margin is actually included or here with this media screen.

09:40.160 --> 09:40.600
All right.

09:40.690 --> 09:41.830
Let me show you why.

09:42.060 --> 09:48.080
So if I present this right and if you're going to have this margin over here.

09:48.260 --> 09:48.730
Right.

09:48.740 --> 09:54.150
What is going to happen is that as I'm going back right you can see that this is always going to be

09:54.150 --> 09:55.120
still gone.

09:55.310 --> 09:55.610
Right.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.090
It's not going to show up anyway.

09:57.100 --> 09:57.630
All right.

09:57.690 --> 10:01.140
So let's say even if I press the button right.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.830
What I would want is still the side and I've always to be here right.

10:04.920 --> 10:10.530
Otherwise if you're not going to write this margined class in actual media equerry what's going to happen

10:10.530 --> 10:11.920
you going to press the button.

10:11.970 --> 10:12.320
Right.

10:12.370 --> 10:17.190
And as you scroll back to the small screen this actually is going to be somewhere lower still the margin

10:17.190 --> 10:18.440
is going to be happening right.

10:18.480 --> 10:23.460
So we only want this margin class to be effective after this screen right now.

10:23.460 --> 10:28.110
Once we're done with this also what you would want is for the whole side now.

10:28.440 --> 10:29.950
Right we're going to say right.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.330
This is going to be a side note.

10:32.550 --> 10:36.080
And we would want that commission to take over time right.

10:36.120 --> 10:45.050
So I'm going to say side of this and we're going to say this is going to be a transition transition

10:45.200 --> 10:50.610
and let's just right and this is going to be Marjan transition to seconds and we're going to say.

10:50.860 --> 10:54.630
All right will say this will refresh and I can see what's going to happen.

10:54.630 --> 10:59.090
All right now this is going to take time actually over two seconds.

10:59.100 --> 10:59.620
All right.

10:59.720 --> 11:03.770
So as I'm pressing on here right you can see that there are going to be appearing.

11:03.900 --> 11:11.200
Now once we're done with this then the next thing we would want to do is actually change it over here.

11:11.220 --> 11:11.960
Right.

11:12.050 --> 11:13.350
You can see or hear it first.

11:13.350 --> 11:18.560
Who would want to have this change right as I'm clicking the button I would want these bars to actually

11:18.560 --> 11:19.210
do something.

11:19.220 --> 11:19.840
Right.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.430
So I'm going to go back to script Geass here.

11:23.510 --> 11:29.120
This is going to be outside of here we're going to have a dollar sign right hand will going to say that

11:29.150 --> 11:33.010
we would want for our now button right.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.950
Now of between.

11:34.970 --> 11:38.950
All right what should happen or here we're going to second toggle.

11:39.200 --> 11:44.200
We're going to say class called class and we're going to say change.

11:44.480 --> 11:50.090
Remember to change clubs that were created in the very very beginning right with our bars.

11:50.150 --> 11:52.450
So I'm going to press it over here refresh.

11:52.570 --> 12:00.740
Now I can see that not only the actual science is disappearing but also our numbers over here are appearing

12:00.830 --> 12:02.420
right now.

12:02.420 --> 12:10.370
What I also would want to do is add here this next class which is going to be max with right to my body

12:10.670 --> 12:12.700
to my actual main point.

12:12.770 --> 12:21.920
So I would need to first create this Max with class and then I need to actually add it to the main.

12:21.920 --> 12:28.370
So let's go ahead and let's actually first add the max with class and then we're going to add it to

12:28.370 --> 12:29.040
the man.

12:29.050 --> 12:30.470
We're going to go here.

12:30.700 --> 12:31.100
Right.

12:31.130 --> 12:33.920
And we're going to say and this is going to be mainsheet assess.

12:34.050 --> 12:34.410
Right.

12:34.430 --> 12:40.970
And again somewhere underneath here let's say inside now we're going to create a Manics with class and

12:40.980 --> 12:47.780
all here and we're going to write and this is going to be a max width here Max width and we're going

12:47.780 --> 12:53.690
to say this is going to be 100 you with us or here right here we're going to and this is going to be

12:53.690 --> 13:00.550
again important here and then we'll have a padding meant zero and 20 right.

13:00.620 --> 13:06.050
And again what we would want to do is I mean as we click the button we would want to add this to our

13:06.230 --> 13:12.090
main right because you can see or hear that once they click at the main and somewhere here right.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.290
We would put a macro on call or you would be able to see.

13:14.340 --> 13:14.800
Right.

13:15.050 --> 13:19.520
So what are you going to do here is going to say once I click the button.

13:19.550 --> 13:20.090
Right.

13:20.150 --> 13:25.250
The third thing that should happen is we're going to select all here the main line.

13:25.250 --> 13:27.630
So first we're going to select the main.

13:27.630 --> 13:33.780
So we're going to say Main and then we're going to say again toggle class and we're going to say target

13:33.800 --> 13:38.230
class and the class is going to be max with more here.

13:38.300 --> 13:38.540
Right.

13:38.540 --> 13:45.410
So we save this and once we refresh and now I can see that we just need to work on some things over

13:45.410 --> 13:46.100
here right.

13:46.310 --> 13:50.690
But the actual Max with glasses actually had it right.

13:50.990 --> 13:54.860
Now we're obviously going to double check once we're all going to hide.

13:54.890 --> 13:58.220
Here are our carso whether everything works right.

13:58.220 --> 13:58.940
So for now.

13:58.940 --> 14:02.280
Just leave it like it is right with this Max with.

14:02.510 --> 14:07.460
And then once we had our carrousel then we're actually going to be able to see everything better right

14:08.000 --> 14:08.210
now.

14:08.210 --> 14:11.320
The thing is over here there are a few things that I would want to fix right first.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.970
What I would want to do over here is this text right.

14:15.110 --> 14:18.360
Because so far I would just have the feature right.

14:18.590 --> 14:24.650
That would be one thing and another thing that I would want to do is actually I want to add or here

14:25.040 --> 14:28.520
is a you can see that this this is non-matching so far right.

14:28.520 --> 14:33.130
So again if we're going to go Natcore here and specked And if we can have a look right.

14:33.170 --> 14:37.340
This one says over here and this is now container's want all four.

14:37.340 --> 14:37.580
All right.

14:37.580 --> 14:44.180
So we already know that we would need to go back here on where the top is and was going to have one

14:44.180 --> 14:46.660
of four right over and say this.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.710
And now they should actually be matched.

14:48.810 --> 14:49.380
Right.

14:49.400 --> 14:53.210
And sure enough now I can see that they exactly marked right now.

14:53.230 --> 14:55.920
Another one let's change the next door here.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.460
So I'm going to go back to index actually now and we're going to change the table going to saying this

15:01.460 --> 15:03.280
is going to be featured.

15:03.480 --> 15:04.650
Right well I'm sorry.

15:04.780 --> 15:08.480
The first one is going to be featured here on this.

15:08.690 --> 15:13.380
Then we're going to say that this is going to be a great year for you.

15:13.560 --> 15:24.180
Then the next one is going to be so west so on your list then after that we're going to have a TV in

15:24.210 --> 15:25.710
the room here.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.690
Then I to know we're going to have like and this is going to be an old

15:36.840 --> 15:37.650
no.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.310
And this guy's going to be her or her history.

15:40.600 --> 15:44.040
So I'm going to say Play history right.

15:44.040 --> 15:51.060
So we said this is FRESH here now have featured radio songless TV and liked them down.

15:51.180 --> 15:53.070
So not that we are ready with this.

15:53.250 --> 15:58.560
Now we can go on and actually had all these moments here like this.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.000
Right.

15:59.190 --> 16:01.580
And then we can add the actual So.
