WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:06.360
What is going on guys and welcome to our project and this project we're going to be creating a responsive

00:06.360 --> 00:14.910
web site using H M L and C Ss and using CIRCE's fluxbox and C S as grid.

00:14.910 --> 00:22.830
So both of them for our response are also going to work with a Jake Weary plugins and the actual Querrey

00:23.160 --> 00:26.010
for some custom things.

00:26.010 --> 00:31.670
So here the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to build more here the nav bar right.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.960
And you can see that it's going to be responsive.

00:34.140 --> 00:41.370
So as we go to the smaller screen when we're going to have a toggle button we can have our links over

00:41.370 --> 00:44.310
here right and you can see these are going to be our font.

00:44.360 --> 00:45.110
Awesome.

00:45.150 --> 00:52.320
However if we go to a bigger screen right we're going to actually use a flex to have more here are now

00:52.320 --> 00:53.740
a bar like this.

00:53.790 --> 00:56.400
We're also going to have a smooth scrolling.

00:56.400 --> 01:02.030
So going out a Jake where we code for a small scrolling so you can see or hear if I press it and go

01:02.040 --> 01:08.510
to services and a portfolio back to services back at home right and or here you can see that it's happening.

01:08.850 --> 01:13.520
And after that now we're all going to have or here a position fixed it.

01:13.740 --> 01:13.970
All right.

01:13.970 --> 01:19.890
So as I started scrolling down and you can see the numbers actually staying in it doesn't matter how

01:19.890 --> 01:20.570
low I go.

01:20.570 --> 01:21.060
Right.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.540
I'm always going to have more here now.

01:23.970 --> 01:29.850
Now after that we're going to have a bad intersection here with these two buttons here like this.

01:29.970 --> 01:34.800
Then on here we're going to have this little small section and we're going to look at how we can use

01:34.800 --> 01:38.220
a C Ss to make these kinds of effects.

01:38.220 --> 01:43.740
All right so we have all had this banner but you can see here this is going to be slow and then over

01:43.740 --> 01:47.120
here we're going to war build our skills section right.

01:47.160 --> 01:53.020
And again we're going to cover how we can make with scissors all kinds of shapes over here like this.

01:53.030 --> 01:53.690
Right.

01:53.730 --> 02:00.070
So as I make the screen smaller right you can see that we're going to be having it responsive.

02:00.240 --> 02:02.080
And again we're going to look at both.

02:02.280 --> 02:07.290
We're going to look at how we can do this with a flex box and how we can do this with scissors.

02:07.510 --> 02:11.810
Right side by side there is going to be a code and you can see the difference here.

02:11.820 --> 02:13.680
Next one is going to be this action right.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.100
Some Scrabble here.

02:15.270 --> 02:19.900
We're going to create a input then we're going to look at how we can style it like this.

02:19.910 --> 02:20.140
Right.

02:20.150 --> 02:22.570
So we have only one border on the bottom.

02:22.710 --> 02:26.140
And again you can see that there's going to be a background right.

02:26.190 --> 02:31.020
The background is going to be parallax effect right so as that ASMS calling you can see the images.

02:31.290 --> 02:35.070
However the whole section is going to have the slanted effect.

02:35.170 --> 02:38.210
And then we're going to have a future project.

02:38.220 --> 02:42.450
We're going to be actually using a Jake replugging called isotopes.

02:42.540 --> 02:43.110
Right.

02:43.170 --> 02:46.080
So basically what it does is you can see that I'm going to have a button.

02:46.260 --> 02:46.590
Right.

02:46.650 --> 02:48.780
These are going to be let's say on my project.

02:48.900 --> 02:54.960
But as I click right it the city shows up then only the country then the water.

02:54.960 --> 02:55.290
All right.

02:55.290 --> 03:01.990
And in fact like all Oriol going to come back and again by default right away it's made responsa.

03:02.130 --> 03:05.670
So you can see how this action is going to look like actually make it like this.

03:05.670 --> 03:12.180
And then after that we'll going to have a About section we're going to be using or hear the accordion

03:12.510 --> 03:14.770
from a J Querrey right.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.520
That's going to be our next section.

03:16.770 --> 03:21.900
You know here we're going to have a current project section we're going to have another jay Querrey

03:22.140 --> 03:22.990
plug in.

03:22.990 --> 03:25.240
This is going to be magnifica pop up.

03:25.240 --> 03:25.470
All right.

03:25.470 --> 03:28.620
So here we have a simple portfolio.

03:28.770 --> 03:35.610
However as we click it over here can go around right and we can actually have all these all these kind

03:35.610 --> 03:40.610
of images right now after that we would want a number count section right.

03:40.710 --> 03:46.460
So again simple or here section our We're using a counter-sue right.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.790
So we have a phantasm.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.490
We have users.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.660
However the numbers are going to be counting.

03:52.830 --> 03:55.520
And this is gammoning is going to be a J.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.380
Replugged.

03:56.430 --> 03:58.760
Now again all the sections right.

03:58.800 --> 03:59.640
Response.

03:59.850 --> 04:03.110
So on the smaller screen you can see there's going to be two of them right.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.140
Can Close the novel here.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.720
And if we go them the smaller screen there's going to be actually only one.

04:09.020 --> 04:11.310
All right so they're all all going to be responsive.

04:11.310 --> 04:15.060
I'm just not going to be repeating this video because it doesn't make sense right.

04:15.060 --> 04:20.590
If I said to you that actual page is responsive then that means every section is going to be responsive

04:21.000 --> 04:22.370
where this is going to be.

04:22.370 --> 04:23.800
Our developers section.

04:23.840 --> 04:24.180
Right.

04:24.330 --> 04:29.520
So this could be our team section or here again we're going to look at how we can make cards how we

04:29.520 --> 04:32.890
can place images or hear something like this.

04:32.960 --> 04:38.000
Then over here we're going to use a flex box to place these fonts are somewhat icons like this right

04:38.540 --> 04:40.250
then or here we're going to be using again.

04:40.260 --> 04:41.840
Jake where you why.

04:42.090 --> 04:45.150
I like to make these programs more or this.

04:45.390 --> 04:48.520
Then I'm thrilled that this is going to be our prices section.

04:48.570 --> 04:54.570
We're going to have everything black right over here and this is going to be our card and it is going

04:54.570 --> 04:56.150
to have a white background.

04:56.520 --> 05:03.000
And after that we're going to have a they say so basically quotes and for this one we're going to be

05:03.000 --> 05:10.560
using a query plug in all curso here and you can see where we're going to be we will be able to slide

05:11.020 --> 05:14.120
on this and we're going to look at how we can customize.

05:14.130 --> 05:14.730
That's right.

05:14.820 --> 05:17.340
Because by default they're not going to have these colors.

05:17.590 --> 05:20.480
And after that this is going to be our photo section.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.340
We're going to have embedded Google Maps on here.

05:23.340 --> 05:26.240
This is going to be check boxes side by side with a text.

05:26.340 --> 05:29.730
And again like I said everything is responsive.

05:29.730 --> 05:33.920
So if we go to the smaller screen we're going to have them side by side here.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.120
The prices are here like this right.

05:36.120 --> 05:42.270
However if I got even smaller sized This is going to be here like a single item and the same or here

05:42.270 --> 05:44.170
goes for these check boxes.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.260
No here for Google Maps.

05:46.260 --> 05:51.140
So let's get ready and let's start working on this exciting project.
