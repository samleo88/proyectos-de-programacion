WEBVTT

00:00.030 --> 00:06.630
Now that we're ready to start working on our project we would need to do our basic set up because all

00:06.630 --> 00:10.450
our projects are going to go cowriter pretty much the same things right.

00:10.620 --> 00:14.510
Even though for different projects they will be actually customized.

00:14.670 --> 00:19.110
So all our projects we're going to need to found are some icons and we're going to need to pick some

00:19.110 --> 00:20.600
kind of font.

00:20.700 --> 00:26.210
Our hero would need some images or he'll going to pick some colors.

00:26.220 --> 00:31.800
So let's go ahead and let's start working our basic setup so he can see or hear that.

00:32.100 --> 00:39.090
I have a folder my project and it's completely empty or it's sitting on my desktop and I'm using a bracket's

00:39.090 --> 00:40.050
texter.

00:40.050 --> 00:44.490
So I'm going to do or he is going to drag this folder on here like this.

00:44.590 --> 00:44.910
Right.

00:44.910 --> 00:47.310
Drag it all the way to my text.

00:47.490 --> 00:52.290
Once it's in there what I'm going to do first I'm going to create a new file and I'm going to say this

00:52.290 --> 00:58.530
is going to be an issue here and for here we're going to make right away a live preview so we can actually

00:58.530 --> 01:00.200
start working side by side.

01:00.570 --> 01:06.240
So this is going to be my real life preview and then I'm going to make it a full screen here like this.

01:06.240 --> 01:06.880
Right.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.150
And then the first thing that we're going to do.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.890
We're going to add a mascot.

01:11.890 --> 01:17.340
So here I'm just going to say this is going to be full HD skulls and home like this.

01:17.340 --> 01:20.320
The language you're going to have is going to be English.

01:20.400 --> 01:25.760
Then over here the style sheet right this is going to be linked to our style sheet over here.

01:25.790 --> 01:31.690
And this is going to be a project and to this is going to be the name of our file we're here link.

01:31.740 --> 01:33.780
This is going to be our main CSSA.

01:33.810 --> 01:35.560
I'm going to leave a comment.

01:35.680 --> 01:39.380
Main see who says that on here you can see this is going to be doing.

01:39.420 --> 01:46.740
And here we're going to say also main CIRCE's right now we would need to create a file to send you file

01:47.210 --> 01:48.810
main success.

01:49.020 --> 01:52.130
Now that we have this we're going to leave this one for now.

01:52.390 --> 01:54.540
And we're going to go back to the next page tomorrow.

01:54.690 --> 01:56.060
And this is going to be script.

01:56.070 --> 02:01.980
This is going to be for javascript going and once in a while some type of javascript in order to make

02:01.980 --> 02:03.670
our website fun.

02:04.010 --> 02:06.060
So now that we have this set up.

02:06.210 --> 02:09.050
First things first let's get our fantastic fantastic mine.

02:09.270 --> 02:14.160
So we're going to send this one over here and we're going to go back over here and you can see that

02:14.160 --> 02:20.670
if we go to a font of some IO on here or you can just go back to Google you could see that if I'm going

02:20.690 --> 02:27.960
write the font awesome or some icons like this you can see that this is going to be the first link that's

02:27.960 --> 02:28.930
going to open up.

02:29.190 --> 02:34.470
So we bravely open up the link and we right away head for a down.

02:34.780 --> 02:35.060
Right.

02:35.070 --> 02:39.260
So here at home you can see that it's down.

02:39.570 --> 02:43.910
So we're going to say we're here and we're going to say that we would want to download.

02:43.980 --> 02:44.490
Right.

02:44.540 --> 02:50.000
You can say we're here you don't need to agree all this right with on us we just you can just say no

02:50.070 --> 02:56.070
form awesome number four and all here what's going to happen is this is going to say show in Finder

02:56.070 --> 02:57.880
and this is going to be our downloads.

02:57.930 --> 03:04.080
So once we open up our zip file or here right you can see the zip file opens and now what we need to

03:04.080 --> 03:06.600
do is drag it to a folder.

03:06.690 --> 03:12.570
So you're just going to minimize this here find the folder project and we're here with who we're going

03:12.570 --> 03:19.110
to do is going to drag this one and actually place it in a project now when it's sitting in our project.

03:19.110 --> 03:25.290
Let's go ahead and actually add a fantastic story so you can see that this is going to be my farm parson.

03:25.350 --> 03:29.850
So we're here under the main to assess what we're going to do is we're going to say this is going to

03:29.850 --> 03:30.420
be common.

03:30.420 --> 03:36.060
This is going to be Fonte awesome icons like this.

03:36.120 --> 03:40.530
So let's create a link here with a Amut.

03:40.530 --> 03:43.080
So here I'm going to say this is going to be Fonte right.

03:43.140 --> 03:46.940
So now I need to actually show where's my folder.

03:47.190 --> 03:51.120
Then we're going to go to see this and I'm going to go to farm Tarsem.

03:51.260 --> 03:54.830
Yes and on here just to test that out and everything is working.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.810
We're going to do a very basic one.

03:56.940 --> 04:03.570
We're going to say this is going to be I with the class of Hey hey hey and let's say this is going to

04:03.570 --> 04:05.310
be home when you're like this.

04:05.310 --> 04:11.820
And now I can see that I have the home and I was the side note for typing my age the e-mail I'm going

04:11.820 --> 04:18.870
to be using and met maquettes extension or here let me show you where it is basically or here it is

04:18.960 --> 04:20.250
already downloaded.

04:20.250 --> 04:26.370
Right so now you can see that we're sitting in a bracket extensions and it just takes a little bit of

04:26.370 --> 04:27.950
time to actually see right.

04:28.070 --> 04:30.270
And then if we go down here right.

04:30.390 --> 04:33.980
This is going to be high speed HD Malins see says workflow.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.020
And basically what it means is that this is going to speed up our workflow.

04:38.170 --> 04:41.990
We don't need to type all the time the full element right.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.760
The force and extra development we can just type a few things and it's basically going to do the audiophile

04:48.780 --> 04:52.440
for us but obviously at the end you're still going to be able to see what you're writing.

04:52.440 --> 05:00.900
So even if I'm even if you are not using them right you'll see what's actually being typed I would suggest

05:01.020 --> 05:07.950
for you to switch it because I'm is really going to speed up your workflow and avoid unnecessary typing

05:07.950 --> 05:10.290
class and IDs and all those kind of things.

05:10.290 --> 05:10.860
Right.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.980
So what I'm going to do will say this.

05:12.990 --> 05:15.370
Now we have found that some you see or hear.

05:15.510 --> 05:18.770
And next we're going to move one and look at what is the next thing.

05:18.990 --> 05:20.130
So now we're done with fun.

05:20.140 --> 05:20.580
Awesome.

05:20.580 --> 05:22.400
Next month would be Google phones.

05:22.510 --> 05:29.640
And again we just go here and type Google fonts and we are led off here to this page and on here I'm

05:29.640 --> 05:34.860
going to download right away rebottle because I like them and they're popular and all kinds of good

05:34.860 --> 05:35.570
stuff.

05:35.580 --> 05:41.750
However obviously you can see or hear that you have choices on choices and choices right.

05:41.830 --> 05:44.050
And here you can be more specific right.

05:44.070 --> 05:50.370
You can click whatever class you want right so you can choose the categories then you have styles right

05:50.370 --> 05:52.490
so you can choose the thickness and slant.

05:52.480 --> 05:58.500
And I mean I going to go over these options because they're very self-explanatory what you can do however

05:58.650 --> 06:00.480
how you download this right.

06:00.510 --> 06:05.130
So what are you going to do here was going out here and you can see that it's a family select.

06:05.130 --> 06:10.830
So what we do here you can see that it opens up and then it says all right to this wouldn't be doing

06:10.830 --> 06:11.990
that we would need.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.910
And this is the thing that we need to place actually in our head element and our is when we would need

06:17.910 --> 06:18.520
to add.

06:18.540 --> 06:18.950
Right.

06:18.960 --> 06:22.030
And obviously this we would have tactual body.

06:22.080 --> 06:26.220
So we're going to do here we're going to say that this is going to be phantasm.

06:26.370 --> 06:32.130
And after that we're here we're going to say this is going to be Google and we're going to say for months.

06:32.180 --> 06:32.740
Right.

06:32.790 --> 06:38.370
So here what is going to happen when the copy and paste this writing this is going to be new fonts will

06:38.370 --> 06:40.970
save this and we're going to go back over here.

06:40.990 --> 06:43.280
I don't know what to say for the whole body.

06:43.330 --> 06:46.960
We're going to go back and we're going to get this from the family rubato.

06:47.550 --> 06:54.660
So we're going to copy this and we're going to go back over here and then copy paste this font family

06:54.670 --> 06:55.590
are.

06:55.710 --> 07:03.120
So now when we have our custom phones let's check it out where we could get a images and where we can

07:03.120 --> 07:06.090
get callers so we can close this from Tarsem.

07:06.270 --> 07:09.720
And obviously you can get images from Google if you want.

07:09.720 --> 07:14.320
However there's always going to be an issue if you're actually trying to sell something right.

07:14.400 --> 07:19.310
Has your web page or something like that that you obviously need to have a copyright.

07:19.380 --> 07:19.960
Right.

07:20.290 --> 07:26.210
You cannot just willy nilly starting other people's images because they obviously belong to them.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.700
So you can always do is go to pixels.

07:28.810 --> 07:33.540
That's one of the Web sites and there's obviously few of them right where you can actually get images

07:33.540 --> 07:37.950
for free more here and they're very actually good quality.

07:38.130 --> 07:41.400
All right so we've got the pixels you can see what's happening right.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.240
You can see that these are going to be images.

07:43.260 --> 07:46.240
But obviously here you can just search right.

07:46.270 --> 07:53.570
So I'm kind to wrangle here a computer and this right and I will going to have computer images on here

07:53.610 --> 07:55.640
if I'm going to type on the city.

07:55.840 --> 08:01.610
Right and we're going to be getting a lot of my city images and I can go on and on right.

08:01.710 --> 08:07.140
So this would be a very nice site to actually get images and actually once you start getting images

08:07.140 --> 08:11.850
from here and once you're going to be surfing around the web you actually are going to notice that a

08:11.850 --> 08:16.190
lot of even well-known Web sites use these as free images right.

08:16.190 --> 08:20.970
It might come as a surprise but you're actually very soon going to notice a lot of people are using

08:20.970 --> 08:21.980
these sites.

08:21.990 --> 08:25.020
So here the next one would be Gratus the graph.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.540
Just because it gives you a lot of funky images.

08:27.750 --> 08:33.210
So if you like some type of I don't know section of your web site or the whole project you want to make

08:33.210 --> 08:34.290
it funky right.

08:34.350 --> 08:39.740
Go to grad school because you can really get some some really cool and interesting images.

08:39.780 --> 08:43.700
Then after that we have afterimages we have colors.

08:43.920 --> 08:50.210
So I'm going to call these guys over here and for the colors I would suggest over here this see and

08:50.240 --> 08:53.460
or here this is going to be two O's and then colors right.

08:53.460 --> 08:55.770
So cool person or something like that right.

08:55.950 --> 09:01.850
And a nice thing here is the generator to go back over here and we click on generator.

09:02.130 --> 09:07.320
And now what we would need to do is actually just start pressing the space bar and we're going to be

09:07.320 --> 09:08.670
giving five options.

09:08.670 --> 09:10.650
It's all here fact repassing space.

09:10.650 --> 09:13.790
But you can see that my colors are changing.

09:13.860 --> 09:18.680
However I can go back over here and let's say you can see this lock so I can lock this car.

09:18.780 --> 09:20.110
And now I'm getting four.

09:20.220 --> 09:20.790
Right.

09:20.790 --> 09:22.550
So now if I pick again something.

09:22.680 --> 09:23.000
Right.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.220
So now I'm going to be having over here.

09:25.540 --> 09:26.970
Then let's say I'm going to pick.

09:27.000 --> 09:27.840
I don't know.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.250
And the collar on.

09:29.260 --> 09:30.190
Right right.

09:30.210 --> 09:31.620
So now we have all of them right.

09:31.620 --> 09:33.810
So let's say I would just need last one.

09:33.810 --> 09:38.700
So I'm just going to keep on pressing on here wherever and till I find whatever color I want.

09:38.700 --> 09:41.480
Now obviously you don't need to use all five of them right.

09:41.640 --> 09:45.490
But what it does it actually has a good suggestions right.

09:45.570 --> 09:52.620
Which callers would actually go together and now that we're actually done with our basic setup we can

09:52.620 --> 09:55.850
go ahead and start working on our project.
