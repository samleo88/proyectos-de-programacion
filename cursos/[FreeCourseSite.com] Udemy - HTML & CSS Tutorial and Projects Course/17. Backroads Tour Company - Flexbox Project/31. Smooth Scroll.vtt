WEBVTT

00:00.520 --> 00:06.900
And last but not least we would like to set up a smooth scroll functionality where once we click on

00:06.900 --> 00:11.530
a link we in fact smooth scroll to that particular section.

00:11.530 --> 00:16.940
So let's say we're going to go for featured services about can go back home.

00:16.950 --> 00:21.330
You can also set this up on this particular link where we'd like to explore resource.

00:21.670 --> 00:27.520
So then we scroll to the stores and if we go all the way to the bottom let's say gallery and then we

00:27.520 --> 00:32.500
can also do the same thing from the footer where within the footer we do have the about.

00:32.500 --> 00:38.140
So again we can head over to about again and we click on the gallery and we go to feature and so on

00:38.140 --> 00:39.090
and so forth.

00:39.160 --> 00:43.450
So essentially which ever link we would want to be small scroll.

00:43.570 --> 00:46.200
We're gonna have a functionality for that.

00:46.210 --> 00:54.550
So in this case we are not going to work on the style Sears has in fact we're going to do our work first

00:54.550 --> 00:57.720
in the indexation email and then app J.S..

00:57.730 --> 01:04.800
So first of all in the index yes or I'm sorry indexation email we would like to set up a new class.

01:04.900 --> 01:10.660
Now the class name here is going to be smooth scroll or scrolling again.

01:11.020 --> 01:18.310
You can name this how you like as long as your later on in fact use it within the same functionality

01:18.640 --> 01:21.580
when you are in fact using the javascript.

01:21.610 --> 01:22.230
OK.

01:22.390 --> 01:29.080
So first of all let me come up with or maybe let me check for sure which class I used and I believe

01:29.080 --> 01:30.940
I use scrolling.

01:30.940 --> 01:34.090
So let's set up scroll link class.

01:34.090 --> 01:42.310
Now you're gonna have to add this particular class to all the links which you'd want to be smooth scroll

01:42.760 --> 01:48.850
meaning to all the links that you would want to have functionality where you click on the link and then

01:48.850 --> 01:50.500
you're gonna smooth scroll.

01:50.500 --> 01:54.130
So let me select this class.

01:54.400 --> 02:01.810
Currently I'm sitting with a number so I'm gonna add this to all my links so I'm about services and

02:01.810 --> 02:10.060
what we're doing again we're adding a new class with the value of scrolling and then I also like to

02:10.060 --> 02:16.090
do the same thing for my hero remember within the hero we had this explorer torch.

02:16.180 --> 02:18.960
So I'd like to add the same functionality here as well.

02:19.060 --> 02:20.410
So we have a trough.

02:20.410 --> 02:24.500
It is currently pointing to the featured and we have button of white.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.220
So let me copy and pasted.

02:26.260 --> 02:30.410
And now we're gonna have a smooth or I'm sorry scrolling as well.

02:30.430 --> 02:35.180
Now keep in mind though one thing then currently once we have our current setup with the nature trip

02:35.560 --> 02:39.290
we already are heading over to that particular section.

02:39.430 --> 02:43.150
Now the only thing is though that it is not happening smoothly.

02:43.220 --> 02:48.680
Well once we click on it we have featured we have about and all that.

02:49.030 --> 02:55.780
So keep in mind that we already are heading over to that particular section is just we do not have a

02:55.780 --> 02:56.680
smooth scroll.

02:56.860 --> 02:58.600
So that should be a hero.

02:58.660 --> 03:04.190
And also remember we had links all the way in the bottom when we had our footer.

03:04.240 --> 03:13.780
So whenever you have a photo or a link you can also add a scrolling scrolling scrolling scrolling and

03:14.440 --> 03:17.010
it scrolling as well.

03:17.020 --> 03:23.230
Let's say that and then we're going to head over back to Algiers again and we're going to have a comment

03:24.190 --> 03:24.910
on the like.

03:24.920 --> 03:28.640
So now our value is not going to be now fixed.

03:28.850 --> 03:39.070
We're going to say a smooth scroll let's first of all write smooth scroll.

03:39.260 --> 03:43.320
And then first and foremost we're going to target dealings.

03:43.370 --> 03:44.160
So it's right.

03:44.150 --> 03:47.410
Concert scroll links.

03:47.480 --> 03:56.030
Again we're just coming up with some kind of name for the variable and let's say document query selector.

03:56.030 --> 04:02.330
Now in this case we would want to select multiple items so we need to use query selector all and then

04:02.330 --> 04:06.940
we are using that class that we just added to all our links.

04:06.980 --> 04:13.040
So let's say scroll links and again let's start very simply by just looking whether our selection was

04:13.040 --> 04:13.900
correct.

04:13.970 --> 04:19.520
So let's look at the scroll links and within the console we should have a node list right now.

04:19.520 --> 04:26.510
Currently this node list is in fact telling me that while it is empty and I can clearly see that again

04:26.780 --> 04:32.410
there's something wrong with that because we should have a list of items.

04:32.420 --> 04:34.960
Now my error is very simple.

04:35.300 --> 04:42.350
I used scroll links where I should use scrolling because it should match exactly the class that I added.

04:42.740 --> 04:49.460
And again I'm just showing you a very simple examples how your functionality might actually work that

04:49.550 --> 04:55.280
if you're not targeting the correct element Well you're gonna have to you're gonna have an error.

04:55.700 --> 04:58.080
So once we console log we have a scroll links.

04:58.210 --> 05:04.990
And notice I do have my noticed that it was in fact something that I was interested in getting right.

05:05.350 --> 05:11.900
Now once I have my scroll links then I would like to use the for each method because I would like to

05:11.930 --> 05:16.030
add a vent listener for each and every link.

05:16.040 --> 05:24.500
Now when we do that is by using a link or I'm sorry not links scrolling is sorry scroll links then we

05:24.500 --> 05:26.650
use the for each method.

05:26.660 --> 05:33.800
That particular method is in fact iterating over our node list and we're gonna say that we're passing

05:33.800 --> 05:40.280
in the callback function and then each and every item is in fact representing that particular item in

05:40.280 --> 05:41.370
that list.

05:41.780 --> 05:47.420
So that is my function and in fact I could sum this up as an our function just so you can see a little

05:47.420 --> 05:48.870
bit clearer.

05:48.980 --> 05:56.660
And then once I pass in let's say the parameter that particular parameter is going to reflect each and

05:56.660 --> 05:58.270
every item in my link.

05:58.430 --> 06:04.780
So item number 0 is going to be there and 1 and all the way up to and 9.

06:05.240 --> 06:11.020
So in this case it is a parameter so I can call this like someone go with a link.

06:11.150 --> 06:16.640
Right now what I would like to do for the link is in fact add a vent listener.

06:16.640 --> 06:21.920
So each and every time we click on a link we're going to add a listener so we're going to be listening

06:21.920 --> 06:25.300
for that particular event the Click event.

06:25.490 --> 06:30.570
And once we click in fact on that particular button Well we're gonna do something.

06:30.570 --> 06:37.760
And first and foremost we're also gonna pass the event object within our callback function.

06:37.760 --> 06:42.710
So once we click on a link we're gonna in fact get our event object.

06:42.740 --> 06:48.270
Now first of all let's just check it by console logging and let's say hello.

06:48.410 --> 06:51.290
You click a link.

06:51.680 --> 06:52.600
Something like that.

06:53.920 --> 06:54.820
Let's save it.

06:54.820 --> 06:58.160
And what I would like to do right now is once we click on it.

06:58.180 --> 06:59.140
NORRIS halo.

06:59.140 --> 07:04.780
You click the link and twice third time and fourth time and all that.

07:04.780 --> 07:12.910
Now first of all you're also gonna notice that once we click on those links like I said we are right

07:12.910 --> 07:19.120
away navigating to our specific section and that is in fact not what I would want.

07:19.120 --> 07:26.830
So since we have our event object what I would like to do first is use this prevent default.

07:26.830 --> 07:27.400
Okay.

07:27.610 --> 07:29.220
So we're going to use the prevent default.

07:29.500 --> 07:35.020
So in this case what is going to happen that once we click on the link even though we are using the

07:35.020 --> 07:36.880
extra funnel that we click on it.

07:36.880 --> 07:43.000
Notice how our page is not moving to our about section okay or services or any of like that because

07:43.000 --> 07:47.920
previously this is exactly what was happening because that was the default behavior of the link.

07:47.950 --> 07:53.800
So since we would like to set up smooth scrolling we need to make sure that we use event prevent default.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.060
That's number one.

07:55.060 --> 07:57.110
Now also on a smaller screen size.

07:57.130 --> 08:01.870
Now that is not an issue for the bigger screen sizes but on a smaller screen size.

08:01.870 --> 08:08.980
What I would like to do is once we click on this particular link I would like to close again my links.

08:08.980 --> 08:10.990
So I like to hide my links.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.450
Now remember what was the functionality for that.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.600
We used a toggle for show links.

08:16.600 --> 08:22.480
So what I would like to do right now is in fact once we click on it first and foremost I would like

08:22.480 --> 08:28.560
to in fact remove that class list or class of short lengths.

08:28.600 --> 08:33.010
So instead of toggling so I just copy paste it but I'm gonna remove it.

08:33.010 --> 08:38.950
So each and every time we're gonna click on that particular link we in fact are going to close it as

08:38.950 --> 08:39.650
well.

08:39.680 --> 08:45.510
Right now we're not navigating to that particular section because again we used event prevent default.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.890
So we in fact avoided the default behavior.

08:49.900 --> 08:54.760
But what we're doing right now essentially is each and every time we're clicking on it we're also closing

08:54.760 --> 08:59.950
the number because I think it's gonna be better for the smaller screen size now doesn't matter on a

08:59.950 --> 09:01.310
bigger screen size of course.

09:01.480 --> 09:05.720
But on a small screen size it makes all the difference in the world.

09:05.830 --> 09:12.760
And once we're done setting up prevent default meaning once we're going to click on the links we're

09:12.760 --> 09:20.110
not gonna scroll there by default as well as once we are done removing the show links class from the

09:20.110 --> 09:27.770
Navarre or I'm sorry from the links then that means that we can proceed and in fact set up our logic.

09:27.790 --> 09:33.760
Now what I'm gonna do right now is in fact delete this particular console log and of course you can

09:33.760 --> 09:38.800
leave it if you like but I'm just going to delete it and then let's think about it.

09:39.190 --> 09:42.290
So for each and every link what do we have.

09:42.700 --> 09:49.870
Well we do have this H ref attribute and there is a way for us in fact to access that H ref attribute

09:49.900 --> 09:52.240
using JavaScript and the way we can do that.

09:52.240 --> 09:59.380
Again we are going to use the event object because the event object has the target property on it and

09:59.380 --> 10:05.860
by using that in fact I could access that interest attribute for each and every link that I'm clicking

10:06.250 --> 10:13.270
whether that is going to be on a no war whether that is going to be somewhere let's say within the footer.

10:13.270 --> 10:13.750
OK.

10:13.750 --> 10:15.060
Same deal.

10:15.100 --> 10:19.840
Now let's do that by in fact getting our ideas.

10:19.870 --> 10:26.690
So what I'm going to do right now is set up my idea variable like I said I'm going to use event target.

10:26.780 --> 10:31.400
And the reason why I can access the event object is because I passed it here within the callback function

10:31.970 --> 10:39.980
and then we have a method by the name of get an attribute the attribute of Morgan for is going to be

10:40.070 --> 10:44.240
a nature of and in fact what I can do is I can just cancel it again.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.200
So let's look for that particular item.

10:46.490 --> 10:51.890
So what I would like to do is just click on it and notice I'm gonna get my idea of about and I can get

10:51.890 --> 10:53.470
services featured.

10:53.570 --> 10:58.750
And essentially what we're doing is we're accessing all the traps that we have.

10:58.820 --> 11:03.820
So whatever link we click on well we get this particular picture of.

11:03.880 --> 11:09.680
Now what I would like to do though is remove that hashtag now just coming in front and the way we do

11:09.680 --> 11:12.920
that is use the slice method and we just say that.

11:12.920 --> 11:18.730
Get me everything starting from the item that is in the position of one.

11:18.830 --> 11:27.290
So we in fact removing the zero index or item that is in the zero index in our string which is that

11:27.290 --> 11:28.170
hashtag.

11:28.190 --> 11:29.550
So now once we click on it.

11:29.550 --> 11:31.340
Notice the hashtag is gone.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.400
And in fact we're just getting these ideas.

11:34.760 --> 11:42.650
Now once we have this particular idea I could select an element and I can say const element and that

11:42.650 --> 11:52.460
element is going to be document get element by I.D. and the I.D. I'm going to use is in fact this particular.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.890
And one that we just got from the target.

11:55.410 --> 12:03.630
And what we could do again is console log the element right away or we can use the offset to our property

12:03.870 --> 12:05.100
on that element.

12:05.130 --> 12:14.650
So I'm going to right away console log the offset top property so let's write element offset TARP and

12:14.740 --> 12:23.500
what is going to happen is that once we let's say click on the about so we open up our number and we

12:23.500 --> 12:25.020
click on the above.

12:25.030 --> 12:30.230
Now this tells me the pixels from the top that about section etc..

12:30.290 --> 12:33.090
And in this case this is six hundred ninety six.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.440
Now I can also check it out.

12:34.450 --> 12:40.600
Let's say featured again same deal in this case though it's two thousand seven hundred eighty two.

12:40.600 --> 12:45.200
Then if we look for two hours then we have two thousand four hundred and forty nine.

12:45.340 --> 12:47.420
And hopefully you get the gist.

12:47.440 --> 12:55.340
So once I get this particular property I know where the actual element it is sitting within the document.

12:55.390 --> 13:08.300
And once I know the distance I can use another method by the name of scroll to so window window scroll

13:08.300 --> 13:12.480
to this particular method is on the window object.

13:12.650 --> 13:21.210
So let's say we know scroll through and then within this particular method we're going to pass in the

13:21.210 --> 13:25.720
object and then within there an object we have few properties.

13:25.740 --> 13:30.840
So first one is going to be what is going to be our horizontal position.

13:30.870 --> 13:33.380
So that's the reason again we're using the left.

13:33.390 --> 13:39.870
So that is very similar how we used a position fixed for example or position absolute where we say well

13:39.930 --> 13:42.730
where we would like to be horizontally and vertically.

13:42.950 --> 13:48.090
And we're going to start with horizontal position and I'm going to say left should be zero because I

13:48.090 --> 13:50.520
wouldn't want to scroll left and right.

13:50.640 --> 13:55.510
In fact I would like to scroll up and down meaning vertically.

13:55.510 --> 13:58.300
And that's the reason where we also have a top position.

13:58.470 --> 14:04.590
And for the top position for the time being we're going to use that off set property.

14:04.620 --> 14:10.620
So each and every element has this offset property and we're going to say scroll to that particular

14:10.620 --> 14:15.140
element the one that has been selected and use that offset properly.

14:15.150 --> 14:17.210
So that's where we're going to scroll.

14:17.220 --> 14:22.850
Now we also have an option of setting up behavior so how we're going to scroll and what I'm going to

14:22.980 --> 14:26.510
use is a smooth value for that.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.770
Now there's gonna be some issues right now.

14:28.770 --> 14:29.060
All right.

14:29.050 --> 14:33.300
I can tell you right away there's still some fixes that we're going to have to do.

14:33.360 --> 14:38.750
However I just want to show that we are going to have some kind of functionality at least.

14:38.880 --> 14:42.630
So something is going to be working now like I said there's going to be some issues that we're going

14:42.630 --> 14:43.350
to fix.

14:43.440 --> 14:49.480
But once you click on it notice which caused the services and we scroll to about then we scroll to let's

14:49.480 --> 14:50.790
say a gallery and all that.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.520
Now what are the problems.

14:53.520 --> 14:57.540
Well first of all our nav bar has its own height.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.610
It has that 62 pixels.

14:59.640 --> 15:06.300
So essentially when we're scrolling we are not ending a right on the edge of that particular element

15:06.360 --> 15:07.240
or section.

15:07.290 --> 15:11.710
In fact we are in the up 62 pixels below.

15:11.790 --> 15:12.420
Right.

15:12.540 --> 15:18.540
Because like I said we are scrolling to the position of that element but we're not taking into account

15:18.900 --> 15:21.230
the actual height of the napper.

15:21.270 --> 15:27.360
Now before we do anything right now before we fix these issues first of all I would like to zoom out

15:27.680 --> 15:33.300
right because there's one more thing that I would like to fix as well because remember previously when

15:33.300 --> 15:37.130
we were looking for our links I said that it was 217 1.

15:37.200 --> 15:41.140
Remember within these stars we set this up as to 71.

15:41.130 --> 15:45.990
Now the issue was that I was zooming in back then.

15:45.990 --> 15:52.920
So what is going to happen if we're going to comment out the NAV links and show links both of the classes

15:52.920 --> 15:56.380
I'm going to show you that in fact it was wrong.

15:57.240 --> 16:05.390
If we head over to let's say nav links you're going to notice that the NAV links are 270 not to 71.

16:05.430 --> 16:13.410
So in order to in fact avoid that behavior by adding to seventy one point forty three I'm going to set

16:13.410 --> 16:19.740
it correctly because on 100 percent is in fact two hundred and seventy pixels instead.

16:19.740 --> 16:20.250
All right.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.080
So first of all let me fix that.

16:22.110 --> 16:24.420
That is the step number one.

16:24.420 --> 16:31.320
Now after that like I said we would want to fix the issue of element offset and the fact that we are

16:31.320 --> 16:36.150
having these 62 pixels and that we are going below.

16:36.210 --> 16:40.950
And again the reason is very simple because once we click on it because we scroll all the way down here

16:41.390 --> 16:47.530
now there is also a difference where there is going to be some more logic on a smaller screen size.

16:47.610 --> 16:52.860
But why don't we start with the bigger screen size so the recording right now and fix the fact that

16:52.980 --> 17:00.540
if I click on the about us I just scroll whatever 62 or one hundred and twenty four pixels below where

17:00.540 --> 17:01.440
I should be.

17:01.440 --> 17:08.700
So first of all let's set up a variable so let's let our position or position variable.

17:08.700 --> 17:09.560
Something like that.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.620
So let's say let.

17:10.620 --> 17:11.780
Position.

17:11.850 --> 17:15.990
Now I'm not going to sign any kind of value to this position variable I'm just going to leave it blank

17:15.990 --> 17:22.400
for now and then I would like to check whether the nav bar has the class or fixed.

17:22.470 --> 17:30.480
So if the NAB bar has the class of fixed well then I would like to actually set position to a element

17:30.540 --> 17:33.210
offset minus sixty two.

17:33.210 --> 17:45.900
So what I'm saying is if Navarre let me set this up properly if nav bar class list then contains if

17:45.900 --> 17:49.490
the nav bar contains the class are fixed.

17:49.550 --> 17:55.170
Essentially if we are scrolling around the page where we are sitting on the top of the page remember

17:55.170 --> 17:56.840
we added this class of fixed.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.880
Only when we started scrolling so I'm just checking whether I'm actually scrolling right now or it's

18:01.890 --> 18:03.690
sitting in a normal position.

18:03.810 --> 18:10.650
So if it has the class affixed then of course I know that I'm scrolling so we're not in a normal position

18:10.650 --> 18:11.960
we already scrolling.

18:12.060 --> 18:13.730
So if we are already scrolling.

18:13.740 --> 18:22.860
My position is going to be element then we have offset job and I'm going to in fact subtract these 62

18:22.860 --> 18:23.760
pixels.

18:23.760 --> 18:29.730
So what I'm saying if I'm scrolling and if I click on a link so if I'd like to navigate move to that

18:29.820 --> 18:34.420
element offset up but also subtract the 62 pixels.

18:34.470 --> 18:41.880
So once we set that I would like to change the top value in fact to a position like so.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.740
And you're gonna notice that.

18:43.930 --> 18:50.100
Well eventually once my def sir is going to kick into gear you're going to notice as we are scrolling.

18:50.100 --> 18:55.290
Once we click on a link we move right exactly where our section is.

18:55.310 --> 18:56.410
We move to services.

18:56.420 --> 18:58.480
Again we move there move to feature.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.380
We move right on top of the section.

19:01.440 --> 19:06.380
Now the problem is going to be when we sit in a normal position once we click on about.

19:06.390 --> 19:08.830
Well first of all we cannot navigate even there.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.620
Because we haven't set up our if statement.

19:11.730 --> 19:16.830
But even if we would just use the same position while it's going to move even more.

19:16.830 --> 19:22.710
Now the reason for that is because we're not accounting to these 62 pixels because once we start scrolling

19:22.950 --> 19:25.300
we take it out of the normal flow.

19:25.320 --> 19:29.290
So in that case we need to say if we are sitting all the way in the top.

19:29.290 --> 19:36.570
So if the position fixed is not added to our number well then we need to subtract even more than we

19:36.570 --> 19:43.950
need to say position alignment and then offset top and subtract.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.910
Hundred and twenty four.

19:46.300 --> 19:51.820
And then you're going to see that if we click on let's say about again we move exactly where our section

19:51.820 --> 19:52.630
starts.

19:52.630 --> 19:53.920
When you click on services.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.950
Now of course we already are scrolling.

19:55.990 --> 19:57.160
So we have to position fixed.

19:57.430 --> 20:03.490
So everything works regardless but we just needed to add this because once we are in the top we're not

20:03.550 --> 20:06.430
again accounting for these 62 pixels.

20:06.430 --> 20:12.130
Now last thing that I would like to point out that this particular setup is not going to work on a smaller

20:12.130 --> 20:17.070
screen size because now we're not accounting for the whole size of the number.

20:17.070 --> 20:18.280
Okay let me show you.

20:18.430 --> 20:21.150
Once we click on it notice how much lower we scroll.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.420
So we should be somewhere here right.

20:23.560 --> 20:27.400
But we scroll let's say to the services now.

20:27.460 --> 20:32.980
In this case it works because again we took out the now bar of the normal flow but if we are all the

20:32.980 --> 20:38.830
way on a back and if we click on any of the links we're going to scroll below where we would want to

20:38.830 --> 20:39.330
be.

20:39.430 --> 20:45.070
And in order to fix that we're going to have to add one more if statement more first of all I would

20:45.070 --> 20:51.940
like to check the height of my nav bar and I I would like to check what is the height of the number

20:51.950 --> 20:53.410
on a small screen size.

20:53.470 --> 21:00.160
Again the way we do that is by looking at developer tools we'll look at elements and let's find right

21:00.190 --> 21:03.210
now our home and let's look at their whole nav bar.

21:03.340 --> 21:06.980
And as far as I can see my now bar is three hundred and thirty two.

21:07.030 --> 21:15.570
So I would need to subtract 332 plus the sixty two pixels and you're going to see that in a second.

21:15.580 --> 21:17.360
So first of all let's start doing that.

21:17.440 --> 21:25.780
Let's say if and now I'd like to check if the window in a row with window in or with is in fact less

21:25.870 --> 21:27.720
than nine hundred ninety two.

21:27.880 --> 21:33.800
Because remember at nine hundred and ninety two in fact we change it around in our styling correct.

21:33.820 --> 21:40.660
Remember we had a neat media query that started to work when while when we moved to nine hundred ninety

21:40.660 --> 21:46.570
two and we know that everything works on a bigger screen size normally but we would like to fix it when

21:46.570 --> 21:49.480
the screen size is less than nine hundred ninety two.

21:49.510 --> 21:57.900
So if the actual screen size is less than nine hundred ninety two that position should be equal to a

21:57.900 --> 21:58.590
element.

21:58.940 --> 22:03.690
So that's right over here element of set up.

22:03.880 --> 22:10.240
And now we need to subtract two things First of all we need to subtract 332 pixels.

22:10.240 --> 22:12.700
That is the height of the number.

22:12.700 --> 22:20.350
Initially once or no sitting in on top as well as these 62 pixels that we have for the height of the

22:20.350 --> 22:22.740
number when we are scrolling.

22:22.750 --> 22:26.140
So now let's just not scroll all the way to the top.

22:26.170 --> 22:27.480
Let's open up our number.

22:27.760 --> 22:28.670
Let's click on it.

22:28.750 --> 22:35.240
And notice how we're nicely going to scroll to a starting point for our section.

22:35.250 --> 22:35.650
OK.

22:35.770 --> 22:41.740
Now again let's try this on the top because it's not exactly going to work as we already scrolling.

22:41.860 --> 22:45.580
Again we come to exactly where the services start.

22:45.580 --> 22:51.940
Now if we're going to start doing that as we're scrolling so noticed right now the height of our neighbor

22:52.000 --> 22:54.170
is not the 332.

22:54.250 --> 23:00.160
So we don't need to have this 300 to 32 plus the 62 and check it out.

23:00.160 --> 23:05.160
If I click on a feature notice I'm definitely not where the featured section start.

23:05.170 --> 23:11.760
So what do we would like to do is in this case also set up one more if statement where again I'm going

23:11.760 --> 23:20.570
to use this nav bar class fixed like so I'm just going to say if the nav bar class fixed is then I would

23:20.570 --> 23:27.240
like to use the position and I'm going to set position to the same thing that I had already here where

23:27.260 --> 23:29.300
I had element offset.

23:29.780 --> 23:31.580
Minus 62.

23:31.640 --> 23:35.510
So that is the case if the class is in fact there.

23:35.510 --> 23:41.690
So if I have the Flex class then I would just like to in fact move it here and then of course if not

23:41.690 --> 23:43.170
then I'm gonna use the other one.

23:43.310 --> 23:50.200
Now are my particular setup is not going to work because I need to include this health statement.

23:50.240 --> 23:53.030
So let me move this position right now within the else.

23:53.360 --> 23:56.630
And now everything is going to move actually work correctly.

23:56.660 --> 23:57.990
We're on a smaller screen size.

23:58.010 --> 24:03.680
If I click on the about from the top I'm going to correctly navigate to the start of the section off

24:03.710 --> 24:04.810
about let's say.

24:04.940 --> 24:11.210
But if I'm already scrolling noticed again we're going to nicely go to a feature towards now everything

24:11.210 --> 24:13.090
already worked on the bigger screen size.

24:13.220 --> 24:14.920
So there should be no issue.

24:15.050 --> 24:20.030
I have about I have the services featured gallery back home.

24:20.030 --> 24:26.420
I can move back home and then I can scroll directly to the services so successfully guys we added also

24:26.420 --> 24:29.870
functionality to our Flex box project.
