WEBVTT

00:00.470 --> 00:03.250
And the next section we're going to be building.

00:03.290 --> 00:05.100
It's going to be in numbers section.

00:05.370 --> 00:10.560
And like I said in one of the previous projects first we included just numbers and I can see that we

00:10.560 --> 00:12.760
have the scroll right now.

00:12.770 --> 00:17.310
We haven't really customized it you can see that all of them are moving the same pace but obviously

00:17.730 --> 00:20.370
you'll be able to see how we can actually change that.

00:20.370 --> 00:25.770
So once I refresh here right you can see that it starts counting from 1.

00:25.860 --> 00:29.110
And in this section we're going to go a little bit differently right.

00:29.110 --> 00:31.130
We can actually start with a plug.

00:31.170 --> 00:34.480
So here you can see that this is going to be numb scroller Plug-In.

00:34.620 --> 00:39.230
So we click over here and it says all in numskulls right here.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.160
This is all it says All right.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.110
So here it says we need Jeg worry.

00:43.590 --> 00:47.610
And here we need the actual number scroller more like this.

00:47.610 --> 00:51.440
And then over here actually has the span of all to actually work.

00:51.680 --> 00:52.560
All right.

00:52.560 --> 00:59.330
So now what we would need to do is actually first downloaded right here and see that we have a mode

01:00.130 --> 01:00.600
here.

01:00.630 --> 01:05.230
This is going to read to get hammered and then clone get down on zip.

01:05.270 --> 01:06.550
Are you doing this.

01:07.110 --> 01:10.390
And just remember numbskull one point.

01:10.690 --> 01:14.780
And as we're on this now we're opening it up.

01:14.950 --> 01:15.210
Right.

01:15.210 --> 01:18.430
So this is going to be a scroller.

01:18.670 --> 01:21.840
We open it up and we're here now scroll one point.

01:21.840 --> 01:22.790
Yes.

01:22.800 --> 01:28.800
So what I'm going to do over here is going to copy this guy over here and we're going to minimize this

01:28.800 --> 01:29.570
for now.

01:29.970 --> 01:37.260
And we can minimize this one and if we go back to our fast banana and we're going to paste an item right

01:37.680 --> 01:44.630
now what I'm going to do over here in my hand he is now underneath a magnifique pop up.

01:44.860 --> 01:51.320
What I'm going to say or when this is going to be scroller I'm scroller now for that scroll really don't

01:51.320 --> 01:57.790
need any kind of code and we're not going to be writing anything so the only thing we need to script

01:57.800 --> 02:03.860
or the source or hear from the source told him say score on this.

02:03.890 --> 02:07.250
Now that number scroller is actually included.

02:07.280 --> 02:11.780
Let's go back over here and let's check it out what they're asking right.

02:11.960 --> 02:18.050
So what they're saying is we would need a spanner here or here and this and this could be any element

02:18.050 --> 02:23.390
right there showing the span of what we're actually going to be placing one in paragraph right.

02:23.390 --> 02:27.300
And once we're all going to get to numbers this is how we can place them.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.660
So let's go back over here.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.970
This is going to be end of current section.

02:31.250 --> 02:33.490
We're going to start with the numbers section.

02:33.500 --> 02:38.380
So we're going to say numbers section here.

02:38.460 --> 02:42.130
Then we're going to copy and paste the line comping on here.

02:42.260 --> 02:53.530
I'm going to say and of numbers and of numbers section we're here we're going to start with a no title.

02:53.660 --> 02:53.870
Right.

02:53.870 --> 03:00.310
So really is going to say section and this is going to be an ID on him saying Mersch.

03:00.840 --> 03:08.340
And over here we have a actual article that's going to have a class of number on it to go on a class

03:08.340 --> 03:12.680
of number and within the number we're going to have three things.

03:12.750 --> 03:20.350
First of all we're going to have a phantasm and it's all going to say a far let's say 5 user here first

03:20.370 --> 03:24.440
time then we're going to have an actual number scroller.

03:24.540 --> 03:33.960
So we're going to go back over here and we're just going to say not copy all but copy this line here

03:34.740 --> 03:38.970
then I'm going to copy and paste it like I said when you don't need to use it over here.

03:38.970 --> 03:40.810
You can use that as a paragraph.

03:41.300 --> 03:42.970
So here and this is going to be a paragraph.

03:43.060 --> 03:43.510
Right.

03:43.710 --> 03:49.320
So this is going to be our scroller and we can actually test that out if we want.

03:49.390 --> 03:49.620
Right.

03:49.650 --> 03:51.990
So we can say this one over here.

03:52.170 --> 03:56.700
And what I would want to do is go back to my recording refresher here.

03:56.730 --> 03:57.200
Right.

03:57.390 --> 04:02.700
And you can see that right now it's hard to see what's the refresh one time and you can see that it's

04:02.700 --> 04:11.740
fast count right now counts really fast here because we have the increment of 10 and the late five right.

04:12.060 --> 04:19.620
We can do all here with data increment one right and let's say we're here we're going to add something

04:19.620 --> 04:20.570
like thousand.

04:20.580 --> 04:20.890
Right.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.310
So every second it's basically counting.

04:23.610 --> 04:25.720
So I'm going to we're going to refresh.

04:26.060 --> 04:28.480
Now I can see that it's one two three.

04:28.530 --> 04:28.850
Right.

04:28.890 --> 04:30.890
And so on and so forth.

04:31.140 --> 04:39.630
So basically the way it works with a number scroller more here if we have it when we have we it says

04:40.020 --> 04:40.790
data mean.

04:40.830 --> 04:41.090
Right.

04:41.160 --> 04:48.390
So this is going to be starting number data Max and number day in an increment increment by the value

04:48.470 --> 04:52.370
range so each time how many numbers it's going and they did delay.

04:52.370 --> 04:56.050
All right total seconds to complete one count.

04:56.070 --> 05:02.820
So basically when I said two thousand nine thousand milliseconds thousand milliseconds is one second.

05:02.820 --> 05:06.020
So pretty much every second right now I have this over here.

05:06.020 --> 05:08.050
All right so you can see how it's counting.

05:08.150 --> 05:10.200
And like I said I'm not going to be.

05:10.320 --> 05:13.180
I showed you how we can actually increment in yourself.

05:13.190 --> 05:13.440
All right.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.040
How you can change the values.

05:15.090 --> 05:16.530
We're not going to be focusing on that.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.410
Was going to leave them all in the same.

05:18.420 --> 05:18.940
Right.

05:19.080 --> 05:26.280
Because what we are interested in actually is fluxbox and read and write and on here all this is going

05:26.280 --> 05:33.150
to say a heading three and Hank 3 is going to say use are right press tab and now we have our first

05:33.150 --> 05:38.480
number and what we want to hear who is going to do like this we're going to copy and paste this.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.290
Let's say three times.

05:40.440 --> 05:40.850
Right.

05:41.070 --> 05:43.290
And we just want to change some values.

05:43.290 --> 05:49.470
So what I'm going to say are here numbers I'm going to use a beautify just so you can see better what's

05:49.470 --> 05:50.550
happening right.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.240
So this is going to be user.

05:52.500 --> 05:58.320
Then the next one is going to be carked plus or here the phantasm.

05:58.380 --> 06:04.420
So I'm going to start over here cart cart here plus here.

06:04.460 --> 06:11.500
And then this is going to say this is going to be downloads downloads here.

06:11.750 --> 06:17.610
Then after that we're going to have a fire extinguisher so fire.

06:18.020 --> 06:24.170
And over here we're going to say X team for sure here.

06:24.590 --> 06:26.310
And then we have an envelope.

06:26.360 --> 06:33.350
So this is going to be let's say emergencies agencies and when we say emergencies that means pretty

06:33.350 --> 06:40.970
much and then we made sure that there were no emergency emergencies that we have covered right now.

06:40.970 --> 06:48.830
We created them or we are all going to say that this is going to be messages messages here and this

06:48.830 --> 06:52.720
one is not going to be used or this is going to be all right.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.520
Once we have them for.

06:54.920 --> 07:01.010
Let's go actually to assess and style the actual numbers.

07:01.060 --> 07:01.560
All right.

07:01.820 --> 07:07.760
So this one is done the actual plug in is also downloaded.

07:07.790 --> 07:14.030
So the last thing left here for that section is going to be actually adding this again we're going to

07:14.030 --> 07:15.490
start with the comment.

07:15.690 --> 07:17.950
I want to say this is going to be a hash tag.

07:17.960 --> 07:24.890
I'm going to say number one get more hash tags here then once we're done with this I'm going to say.

07:24.890 --> 07:28.850
Class of number.

07:28.910 --> 07:30.450
Number over here.

07:30.590 --> 07:36.030
First of all going to have a text align center then it will have a background.

07:36.230 --> 07:40.570
And we're going to have hash tag 1 9 1 9 1 9.

07:41.030 --> 07:48.800
Then we're going to have a padding of 40 pixels on this and 0 pixels from the sides or it's on the top

07:48.800 --> 07:55.200
bottom and I have a color and the color isn't going to be hash tag.

07:55.220 --> 08:06.170
E D D E A for red so light or here yellow color and over here we're going to have two things with transition.

08:06.200 --> 08:12.730
When to say a background is going to be another two seconds ease and color.

08:12.860 --> 08:17.540
Two seconds is right so most of them are going to change.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.820
And let's again create more space here like this.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.710
So then we can actually work.

08:24.210 --> 08:33.920
And we are going to say number and we're going to say how we're real to say a grown R G B I'm going

08:33.930 --> 08:39.870
to say one online one or six and seventy nine.

08:40.070 --> 08:46.020
All right so this is going to be background as it were hovering and color is going to be hashtag FFC.

08:46.350 --> 08:48.920
And nine one for more here.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.810
And let's just check it out.

08:50.810 --> 08:51.080
All right.

08:51.080 --> 08:55.840
So if I say this maybe we're going to have to create something in the room again.

08:56.300 --> 09:02.910
But as you can see that's what's happening right as I'm hovering the color and the background is changing.

09:03.140 --> 09:13.860
Then we need to do with a number from and here and we're going to say font size let's say 60 60 pixels

09:13.860 --> 09:16.580
over here and this is going to be big.

09:16.860 --> 09:22.520
Then we're going to have the actual class of I'm scrolling around the actual paragraph.

09:22.620 --> 09:26.820
So I'm going to say now I'm scroller we're here.

09:27.080 --> 09:38.730
We're going to say font size 25 and margin 20 pixels and 0 and then the last thing is going to be heading

09:38.730 --> 09:39.130
3.

09:39.180 --> 09:50.160
So I'm going to say a number number and having three here and we're going to be text transform and we're

09:50.160 --> 09:51.540
going to say Asperger's.

09:51.900 --> 09:55.380
And so now we're going to actually transform to uppercase.

09:55.380 --> 09:56.570
Let's say this.

09:56.880 --> 10:00.110
And it's actually a meteor equerries.

10:00.210 --> 10:00.580
Right.

10:00.750 --> 10:06.720
So how this is going to change once the screen gets bigger basically let's make it responsive.

10:06.750 --> 10:09.820
First thing we're going to start with a 4 x marks.

10:09.900 --> 10:20.460
So I'm going to say media screen and I'm not going to say men with and this is going to be five 576

10:20.820 --> 10:22.680
576 pixels.

10:22.980 --> 10:27.590
And then all here we're going to say is that this is going to be a numbers.

10:27.970 --> 10:34.800
And so hash tag numbers and all here we're all going to say is this play flex here.

10:34.840 --> 10:38.520
I don't we can just say this and maybe go have a look.

10:38.610 --> 10:40.610
What we have right here.

10:40.680 --> 10:45.660
Now we have the flux and now obviously we need to spread them out right.

10:45.990 --> 10:53.990
So here we're going to say is this is going to be a justified contact space between then and we're going

10:53.990 --> 10:57.120
to have a flex wrap.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.650
I'm going to say wrap this.

11:00.650 --> 11:08.310
And again I can just make the size bigger here that we can see better and orient for that number.

11:08.450 --> 11:16.750
As always we're all going to have a simple flux 0 0 0 50 percent nothingness.

11:16.790 --> 11:22.910
So now that we save it if we're going to go back to shouldn't be covering 50 percent.

11:23.150 --> 11:27.650
Now obviously this is going to be for the small screen.

11:28.030 --> 11:35.280
Basically Biggert and 576 whoever we're going to do also do it for a 992.

11:35.710 --> 11:43.830
So again we're going to do very simple here copy and paste this or here and we're going to say Nine-Nine

11:43.890 --> 11:45.350
too right.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.580
And now all this stays the same.

11:49.210 --> 11:56.340
And for the number we just need to change 25 25 percent again to save it.

11:56.690 --> 11:58.210
And we're here to refresh.

11:58.420 --> 11:58.730
All right.

11:58.750 --> 12:01.090
And now it's going to be four of them.

12:01.160 --> 12:04.660
Right exactly like this and you can see how the numbers are counted.

12:05.140 --> 12:13.240
Then after that we need to do it with the grid so Id say forward slash or we're all going to come on

12:13.250 --> 12:17.890
this out forward slash we're going to do it with the grid.

12:18.180 --> 12:23.710
So when to say media screen and note here we're going to do the same thing.

12:23.730 --> 12:23.970
Right.

12:23.980 --> 12:28.160
So men with year five.

12:28.310 --> 12:30.350
So only six pixels.

12:30.360 --> 12:38.120
Then after that what we would want is for the numbers to be on display grid numbers display.

12:38.270 --> 12:44.990
When you say grid here and and grid template columns is going to be one fraction each.

12:45.020 --> 12:51.870
So we're going to say grid template columns and we're going to say one fraction one fraction on it like

12:51.930 --> 12:52.200
this.

12:52.200 --> 12:52.850
Right.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.520
And now again we need to just add another one for the bigger screen.

12:57.780 --> 13:06.880
So we're going to go back or hear men with two and we're here we're going to change a little bit differently.

13:06.910 --> 13:07.970
Can delete this.

13:08.010 --> 13:12.830
And this is going to be a repeat for one fraction I repeat here.

13:13.590 --> 13:19.230
Four and this is going to be one fraction really like this.

13:19.230 --> 13:24.860
And again if we say it if were fresh This should work exactly the same.

13:25.070 --> 13:27.370
And you can see that it doesn't.

13:27.590 --> 13:27.820
Right.

13:27.830 --> 13:30.020
So I made a mistake somewhere.

13:30.200 --> 13:35.230
So let's go back over here and see where I actually made a mistake.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.530
And we're live with the numbers.

13:37.740 --> 13:42.040
It's not a number it's numbers or number and numbers.

13:42.350 --> 13:48.070
So when we say it refresh and sure enough now we have it right.

13:48.140 --> 13:55.530
And honestly if I would actually make this smaller right this is going to be actually two of them.

13:55.970 --> 13:58.280
Now we are ready to move on to next section.
