00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,720
Alright, so what we're going to be doing
is adding a relative timestamp to each

2

00:00:03,720  -->  00:00:08,519
one of our posts and so we actually need
to change the posts model here, because

3

00:00:08,519  -->  00:00:13,889
when we're getting posts we're setting,
where is it right there, setting the name

4

00:00:13,889  -->  00:00:19,080
in the content of the post, and so what
we actually need to do as well, actually

5

00:00:19,080  -->  00:00:21,570
we're not doing that there were doing it
right here,

6

00:00:21,570  -->  00:00:25,619
so what we're doing here is we need to
be able to access it.

7

00:00:26,189  -->  00:00:30,570
So, in this instance what we're going to,
go ahead and open the controller

8

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:32,700
here,

9

00:00:32,700  -->  00:00:37,290
well maybe this will work right away.
What we're going to do is we're going to

10

00:00:37,290  -->  00:00:49,829
set under here let's open up &lt;span class="timestamp"&gt; and then

11

00:00:49,829  -->  00:01:01,260
"$ humanize.naturaltime(datetime.datetime.now)" Actually, rather than

12

00:01:01,260  -->  00:01:06,060
putting this in our templates let's do
this at the model level. So what we're

13

00:01:06,060  -->  00:01:14,250
going to do here is just print out "$post['timestamp']" and then we're going to create

14

00:01:14,250  -->  00:01:19,290
the timestamp in the posts model. So what we're going to do is we're going to

15

00:01:19,290  -->  00:01:27,840
"import humanize" and then right here
when we're getting all posts we're going

16

00:01:27,840  -->  00:01:43,439
to set "post["timestamp"] = to humanize.naturaltime( )" going to pass

17

00:01:43,439  -->  00:01:54,119
in "datetime.datetime.now( ) - post["date_

18

00:01:54,119  -->  00:01:56,759
added"])" and this should work.

19

00:01:56,759  -->  00:02:02,820
So let's go ahead and check this out.
Going to go ahead and open up a browser.

20

00:02:07,530  -->  00:02:18,420
Then you'll see that it does in fact
work exactly how it's supposed to.

21

00:02:18,420  -->  00:02:21,660
Now, the only thing i'm going to do is
I'm going to style this up a little bit

22

00:02:21,660  -->  00:02:25,110
to make it look a little pretty, and
there we go.

23

00:02:26,880  -->  00:02:29,880
So if I post a new one here

24

00:02:38,990  -->  00:02:44,510
you'll see that I posted now. If I wait a
few seconds and refresh it's going to say

25

00:02:44,510  -->  00:02:46,580
posted x seconds ago.

26

00:02:46,580  -->  00:02:50,960
If we were to wait even longer it would
say posted a few minutes ago, you know,

27

00:02:50,960  -->  00:02:55,880
etc. So that's how we're, that's how we've
improved this, now we're also going to

28

00:02:55,880  -->  00:02:59,930
build out a comments section for each
one of these posts and then I think

29

00:02:59,930  -->  00:03:03,320
that's the last thing that we're doing,
and I'm doing that show you guys how you

30

00:03:03,320  -->  00:03:08,570
can chain different
collections kinda a one object like we

31

00:03:08,570  -->  00:03:10,160
did for the user object here.
