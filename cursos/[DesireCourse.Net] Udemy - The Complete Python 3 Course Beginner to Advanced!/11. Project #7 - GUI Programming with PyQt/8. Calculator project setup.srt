00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,129
Alright, so, what I'm going to be doing in

2

00:00:02,129  -->  00:00:04,980
this video is teaching you guys how to

3

00:00:04,980  -->  00:00:09,570
cope with data loss. Well, that's just a joke

4

00:00:09,570  -->  00:00:12,540
actually because I just needed to delete all that,

5

00:00:12,540  -->  00:00:13,889
but what we're actually going to be doing is

6

00:00:13,889  -->  00:00:17,520
starting work on our calculator. So, this

7

00:00:17,520  -->  00:00:19,680
is going to probably span a few videos

8

00:00:19,680  -->  00:00:23,039
and then I also want to make a text

9

00:00:23,039  -->  00:00:25,080
editor that can actually save files

10

00:00:25,080  -->  00:00:27,210
stuff, and I also want to make a web

11

00:00:27,210  -->  00:00:29,310
browser. So those are the three projects

12

00:00:29,310  -->  00:00:30,720
we're going to be doing and I think we're

13

00:00:30,720  -->  00:00:32,399
going to learn enough in those videos

14

00:00:32,399  -->  00:00:35,700
that we can end the qt section there. I

15

00:00:35,700  -->  00:00:38,460
was on my YouTube channel and I did a

16

00:00:38,460  -->  00:00:42,930
pygtk tutorial a while ago, just for

17

00:00:42,930  -->  00:00:47,640
the sake of it, and I was under the

18

00:00:47,640  -->  00:00:51,719
impression that pygtk is not supported

19

00:00:51,719  -->  00:00:55,110
anymore. I mean it's pretty obsolete and

20

00:00:55,110  -->  00:00:56,579
I just thought you know that it was

21

00:00:56,579  -->  00:00:59,340
obsoleted, but somebody commented on my

22

00:00:59,340  -->  00:01:01,710
video and told me that it actually is

23

00:01:01,710  -->  00:01:04,589
supported and maintained through I think

24

00:01:04,589  -->  00:01:06,689
it was pygoobject,, or something like

25

00:01:06,689  -->  00:01:09,210
that. So I will check that out and if

26

00:01:09,210  -->  00:01:11,369
that's the case then we can get a fresh

27

00:01:11,369  -->  00:01:15,869
Python binding library for gtk. I'd also

28

00:01:15,869  -->  00:01:17,280
like to do some of that.

29

00:01:17,280  -->  00:01:19,830
So, what we're going to do here we're

30

00:01:19,830  -->  00:01:21,119
just going to focus on getting our

31

00:01:21,119  -->  00:01:24,240
calculator application to run. so we need

32

00:01:24,240  -->  00:01:26,880
to make some imports. So again import sys.

33

00:01:26,880  -->  00:01:31,799
Let's go ahead and import from PyQt5

34

00:01:31,799  -->  00:01:36,780
.QtWidgets we're just going to

35

00:01:36,780  -->  00:01:46,979
import everything. from PyQt5.QtGui

36

00:01:46,979  -->  00:01:53,040
we're going to import everything. And from PyQt5

37

00:01:53,040  -->  00:01:59,700
.QtCore import everything. So those

38

00:01:59,700  -->  00:02:01,439
are our imports, I just wanted to make it

39

00:02:01,439  -->  00:02:02,939
simple so that we don't actually have to

40

00:02:02,939  -->  00:02:04,500
go through each item that we need, so

41

00:02:04,500  -->  00:02:06,540
just import everything and it will be fine.

42

00:02:06,540  -->  00:02:08,819
So what we're going to do is we're

43

00:02:08,819  -->  00:02:12,360
going to create our application. So as

44

00:02:12,360  -->  00:02:13,590
with the last video it's going

45

00:02:13,590  -->  00:02:16,080
to inherit qwidget, so let's go ahead and

46

00:02:16,080  -->  00:02:23,220
type class Application, and it inherits from

47

00:02:23,220  -->  00:02:29,670
QWidget, and then we're going to

48

00:02:29,670  -->  00:02:37,410
initialize the application. And within

49

00:02:37,410  -->  00:02:39,420
the initialization function we're going

50

00:02:39,420  -->  00:02:42,450
to initialize the class that it has

51

00:02:42,450  -->  00:02:48,810
inherited, so super( ).__init__( ). And then we're

52

00:02:48,810  -->  00:02:51,299
going to set the title of our window, so

53

00:02:51,299  -->  00:02:56,099
self.setWindowTitle, and I'm just

54

00:02:56,099  -->  00:02:58,170
going to set mine to "Calculator" you guys feel

55

00:02:58,170  -->  00:03:00,569
free to set yours to whatever you want.

56

00:03:00,569  -->  00:03:03,329
So we've got the window's title set,

57

00:03:03,329  -->  00:03:04,890
nothing would happened when we run this

58

00:03:04,890  -->  00:03:06,360
yet because we're just declaring a

59

00:03:06,360  -->  00:03:10,019
class. So, what we need to do is let's go

60

00:03:10,019  -->  00:03:14,040
ahead and open our application at the

61

00:03:14,040  -->  00:03:18,750
bottom here by running if __name__ ==

62

00:03:18,750  -->  00:03:30,420
'__main__':, let's type app = QApplication, and we're

63

00:03:30,420  -->  00:03:36,269
going to pass in sis.argv.

64

00:03:36,269  -->  00:03:41,940
Our window is going to be Application, and

65

00:03:41,940  -->  00:03:44,669
then we're going to type sys.exit and so

66

00:03:44,669  -->  00:03:47,700
this system is going to make this

67

00:03:47,700  -->  00:03:51,419
application exit when the

68

00:03:51,419  -->  00:03:52,950
method that we passed it has completed,

69

00:03:52,950  -->  00:03:58,500
so it's going to be app.exec. So let's

70

00:03:58,500  -->  00:04:02,569
go ahead and run this file,

71

00:04:04,470  -->  00:04:08,190
and we didn't show it that's right. Alright,

72

00:04:08,190  -->  00:04:13,020
so, let's just type self.show right

73

00:04:13,020  -->  00:04:16,320
in the init function, and there we go,

74

00:04:16,320  -->  00:04:20,430
there's our application. So in the next

75

00:04:20,430  -->  00:04:21,600
video we're going to be talking about

76

00:04:21,600  -->  00:04:23,940
the grid layout specifically, and I'm

77

00:04:23,940  -->  00:04:27,230
going to show you guys a couple of examples.
