00:00.450 --> 00:06.950
And once we have covered justify content that was responsible for aligning our items horizontally next

00:07.010 --> 00:14.310
one up we're going to take a look at the online content that is responsible for aligning our items vertically.

00:14.310 --> 00:22.630
And also since CSX says grid is in fact using implicit grid meaning as we keep on adding items.

00:22.710 --> 00:26.230
Grid is smart and it just keeps on adding rows.

00:26.400 --> 00:33.720
Technically if we wouldn't want to we can align our items without specifically setting up any kind of

00:33.720 --> 00:34.280
rows.

00:34.440 --> 00:40.710
So I can show you right away that let's say if I'm gonna go with online content and I'm going to go

00:40.710 --> 00:42.080
with the value of center.

00:42.090 --> 00:45.900
Notice how my items are nicely sitting in the center.

00:45.900 --> 00:52.050
Now one thing we need to keep in mind though that when we are working with aligning items vertically

00:52.380 --> 00:54.820
we for sure need to have a height.

00:54.890 --> 00:56.760
So since we have hundred percent right now.

00:56.940 --> 00:59.120
That's the reason why everything is work.

00:59.220 --> 01:02.910
If it wouldn't be height so if there wouldn't be any kind of height.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.570
Well it wouldn't work.

01:04.590 --> 01:11.130
Now I also would like let you know that by default we have the stretch and I guess the best way to show

01:11.130 --> 01:17.460
that is let's say if I'm going to comment on these last three items and if we're just going to comment

01:17.460 --> 01:25.110
out also our center you're going to notice that our columns are stretching all the way from the top

01:25.200 --> 01:26.460
to a bottom.

01:26.460 --> 01:32.310
Now of course what happens since we're adding more rows than they are just dividing that space that

01:32.310 --> 01:33.450
we already had.

01:33.450 --> 01:34.140
Correct.

01:34.140 --> 01:37.530
But by default you're going to have this stretch behavior.

01:37.530 --> 01:43.080
So even though I haven't added a stretch while I still have that behavior.

01:43.110 --> 01:49.860
So if we're going to test it out let's say a line content and I'm gonna go ahead stretch notice nothing

01:49.860 --> 01:56.880
is going to change now so let me comment it out so we can keep on working and right after the stretch

01:57.300 --> 02:00.170
I'm going to take a look at the Flex start.

02:00.300 --> 02:07.050
So let's say a line content and then let's write flex start something like that.

02:07.050 --> 02:10.520
So now my columns are all the way on the top.

02:10.590 --> 02:14.580
Now I also like to let you know that of course we could set up our rows.

02:14.790 --> 02:20.110
So let's say a grid template rows numbers in a couple with some kind of values.

02:20.190 --> 02:23.720
So let's say 200 pixels and 200 pixels.

02:23.850 --> 02:28.170
But if I wouldn't want to I could just keep my auto ones as well.

02:28.170 --> 02:35.520
It is not against the law so let's write flex and now my items are going to sit all the way in the bottom.

02:35.520 --> 02:41.670
Cause we can copy paste that and check it out the values then we have space around space between as

02:41.670 --> 02:46.800
well as the space evenly also probably should be there but oversea.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.870
So let's write space around.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.960
So now we have some space around space between.

02:54.230 --> 02:59.520
Now we have space between and let's try it out space evenly.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.560
And now we have space evenly.

03:01.650 --> 03:09.270
So essentially these are the values that we can use when we use online content that is responsible for

03:09.270 --> 03:11.340
setting up our items vertically.
