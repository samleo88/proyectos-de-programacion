00:00.600 --> 00:03.280
We is however pseudo class selector.

00:03.420 --> 00:05.160
It was somewhat straightforward.

00:05.400 --> 00:09.140
So only the changes were happening as we're hovering over a deal.

00:09.870 --> 00:12.660
However with links we have a little bit more state.

00:12.750 --> 00:16.860
So Lincoln v just general link then Lincoln we visited.

00:16.860 --> 00:20.100
We can also hover over the link and the active link.

00:20.160 --> 00:22.530
So why don't we take a look again.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.490
Bye bye.

00:23.490 --> 00:24.690
You're going to be gone.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.320
And also within the next session email.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.370
What is it gonna create.

00:28.370 --> 00:29.100
Bunch of links.

00:29.110 --> 00:31.530
So let me first delete all of them.

00:31.560 --> 00:35.170
Then let's say here again this is gonna be just a general link.

00:35.430 --> 00:38.400
So let's write general and link.

00:38.730 --> 00:41.080
Then we're going to copy and paste it here.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.200
Gonna write and on now visited link.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.650
We can go with this.

00:44.670 --> 00:49.120
Can you just say visited is a dead link.

00:49.590 --> 00:50.390
The second one.

00:50.550 --> 00:57.310
Then we have the active one and the hardcover one so for the hover one again this is gonna be very simple.

00:57.310 --> 01:02.070
I was gonna say however although what's gonna happen is as we're hovering all of them you're obviously

01:02.070 --> 01:10.920
gonna be able to see anyway but that is just a side note and let's right with active one so active link

01:11.460 --> 01:12.260
something like this.

01:12.630 --> 01:18.860
So here that more with capital letter and fewer of them are is gonna be with the lowercase letter.

01:19.290 --> 01:25.220
Now this is again somewhat straightforward meaning only thing we need to do is just say that.

01:25.410 --> 01:27.150
Let's say would want to select all the links.

01:27.660 --> 01:28.640
So how you gonna write.

01:28.830 --> 01:34.280
Well we can just say that all the links that have been on a page.

01:34.280 --> 01:38.310
So let's say a link and then we're looking for something.

01:38.340 --> 01:43.030
Let's start very simply by color and let's say the color is going to be OK.

01:43.110 --> 01:47.610
Now all my links are going to have this color again very soon.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.870
Now we also have option of visiting because we can click on a link so that way we're visiting the link.

01:53.050 --> 01:55.830
Now in order to do that we're just going to say visited.

01:55.860 --> 02:01.930
So if we have clicked on a link let's say or read something like this.

02:01.990 --> 02:04.950
Now I'm gonna head over to the second one to visit anyone.

02:05.070 --> 02:09.150
But again you can click on any link and what's going to happen the moment we're going to click on it

02:09.600 --> 02:11.550
all of them are gonna be read.

02:11.550 --> 02:13.900
Now what is the reason why all of them are red.

02:14.040 --> 02:18.290
Because our H rough attribute is here to hashtag.

02:19.050 --> 02:22.360
So if we would want we wouldn't want this annoying thing.

02:22.530 --> 02:25.890
Who's gonna write ATP ATP.

02:25.890 --> 02:31.820
Then again we're gonna have to forward slashes and let's say Google dot com on the moment gonna save

02:31.830 --> 02:32.360
it.

02:32.370 --> 02:38.900
Notice this is not visit like Oh just please remember that if you're gonna have multiple links they're

02:38.910 --> 02:40.940
all going to be pointing to the same thing.

02:40.940 --> 02:46.200
If you're going to click on one of them obviously the same thing is gonna happen now again we hear we

02:46.200 --> 02:47.370
have multiple options.

02:47.670 --> 02:52.170
If you don't like the fact that all of them technically have been visited could just change this around

02:52.170 --> 02:52.850
to Google.

02:52.860 --> 02:57.130
Just remember that the moment you were gonna click on one of the Googles there are also gonna be visited.

02:57.660 --> 02:58.490
Let's save this.

02:58.510 --> 03:00.780
Okay so this is gonna be visit and link.

03:00.910 --> 03:02.010
Then what else we had.

03:02.010 --> 03:03.400
So we had a hover effect.

03:03.810 --> 03:08.120
So that was again for all of them obviously since we're all gonna be able to hover.

03:08.190 --> 03:11.520
In this case I don't know what color is gonna be blue.

03:11.640 --> 03:12.330
Now what happened.

03:12.330 --> 03:16.190
So as I'm hovering over the link obviously the color is going to turn blue.

03:16.350 --> 03:21.470
Even the one that has visited because again this just shows that we have clicked on a link.

03:21.660 --> 03:27.630
Now last but not least we have the active one and the active one happens as we're clicking on the link

03:27.710 --> 03:32.840
so there's gonna be a split second as we click on the link so link is active before.

03:32.850 --> 03:35.190
Technically it says that it was visited.

03:35.190 --> 03:42.650
So for this we can just say active again and I don't know we can have the green one and this is where

03:42.650 --> 03:47.540
we're gonna be really have to pay attention because this is gonna change literally over the second.

03:47.610 --> 03:52.680
So as what happens is as I have a rule here and if I click on it I mean yeah.

03:52.700 --> 03:58.070
And if I'm holding the left key then obviously we're gonna be able to see that this is not visited the

03:58.320 --> 03:59.200
link yet.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.760
This is not any more blue because when the hovering.

04:02.010 --> 04:03.420
So this would be the active one.

04:03.420 --> 04:07.280
So that's where we would use this pseudo class selector on the moment.

04:07.290 --> 04:13.440
I'm gonna let go of the actual obviously left key and what happens is I'm visiting the Google first

04:13.440 --> 04:17.190
and foremost because this was the link and now all of them are red.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.740
Now the reason why this is red because we already clicked on it.

04:20.190 --> 04:22.560
But rest of them were Google anyway.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.650
So now my links are showing us visited.

04:25.740 --> 04:31.650
Now this is in general how we can use pseudo class selectors with links whether that's link visited

04:31.650 --> 04:33.150
hover or active.
