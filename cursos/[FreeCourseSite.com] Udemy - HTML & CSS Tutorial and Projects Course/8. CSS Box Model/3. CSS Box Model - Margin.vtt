00:00.560 --> 00:01.360
Next one up.

00:01.400 --> 00:06.620
We're all going to have the margin on again we're just going to check it out first in the image and

00:06.620 --> 00:12.470
we see that pairing was the distance in between the edge of the element and the content and then the

00:12.470 --> 00:19.020
margin would be the distance in between let's say the screen or other elements and we can just test

00:19.020 --> 00:20.230
that out first.

00:20.240 --> 00:25.430
Now you know what I can just get rid of all these values and I was going to keep it simply by padding

00:25.900 --> 00:30.330
and let's say 20 pixels there's gonna be 20 pixels all around.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.050
And also let's do the same thing over here.

00:33.170 --> 00:39.650
I will go to common to south just so we know that this obviously works but I'm going to uncommon right

00:39.680 --> 00:46.640
now and I'm first putting analysts do exactly the same thing where it was 20 pixels awesome.

00:46.660 --> 00:48.850
Everything is working really nice with the panic.

00:48.850 --> 00:49.890
Well what about the margin.

00:50.560 --> 00:55.930
Well we have the same options we can write margin and then we again we're looking for margin but our

00:55.930 --> 00:58.910
margin left margin to maybe not.

00:58.930 --> 01:00.950
Let's test that out all of the options.

01:00.960 --> 01:04.210
Let's just say first with margin right.

01:04.270 --> 01:06.270
What do you think is going to happen right now.

01:06.280 --> 01:11.950
I have some kind of margin and this is some case already where even though we didn't at any margins

01:12.460 --> 01:15.820
the default browser stars are adding these margins.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.650
This is the reason why you see these distances in between.

01:18.990 --> 01:24.310
And this is gonna be a lot of times especially in the beginning once you start out the annoying factor

01:24.310 --> 01:29.680
where you're like oh wait a minute I'm doing all this with a layout and why this is not working why

01:29.680 --> 01:31.340
am I keep getting this margin.

01:31.780 --> 01:35.250
Well that's the case because it starts off by default.

01:35.270 --> 01:39.110
You need to be very careful with that but with margin right.

01:39.320 --> 01:43.630
What I would like to write and let's try 50 pixels.

01:43.870 --> 01:45.110
What do I have right now.

01:45.130 --> 01:49.310
So I have more than my margin on right is going to be 50 pixel.

01:49.420 --> 01:55.480
And again I can go all around like we did with the padding but I think it would be a waste of our time

01:55.480 --> 02:01.000
since we know that they wouldn't work exactly the same like we had with the padding what I do want to

02:01.000 --> 02:03.730
show you is that how we can get rid of this default.

02:04.450 --> 02:11.440
I already set the preset previously in my videos where I just select all the elements and we added the

02:11.470 --> 02:12.430
property.

02:12.580 --> 02:16.830
Now I'm not going to do this in this video because eventually we're going to come back to it anyway.

02:17.050 --> 02:22.420
But I do want to show you that if I'm gonna head over to margin and in this case I would like to have

02:22.900 --> 02:24.240
margin bottom.

02:24.310 --> 02:28.930
Now the reason why I would want to set margin bottom is because I would want to show you how we can

02:28.930 --> 02:35.030
stack one on top of each other because at the moment you notice they do have the margin in between.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.900
But we didn't work on that margin.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.250
It's obviously nowhere in our system.

02:39.850 --> 02:40.620
So how do we do.

02:41.220 --> 02:42.700
Where does the margin bottom.

02:42.700 --> 02:48.400
And instead of the value of 20 pixels 50 pixels hundred and twenty pixels.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.710
I'm going to go with simple zero.

02:50.710 --> 02:51.790
What happens.

02:51.790 --> 02:54.200
Well I'm getting my margin smaller.

02:54.280 --> 03:00.580
I do still have the margin because the key here is paragraph still has the margin on top.

03:01.180 --> 03:04.210
Okay let's get rid of it let's say margin.

03:04.250 --> 03:08.300
We're looking for margin up and margin to surprise surprise.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.990
We're gonna go with 0.

03:10.060 --> 03:11.650
What do you see right now.

03:11.650 --> 03:16.620
Did we eventually get rid of the default margin that we're getting.

03:16.720 --> 03:17.990
I think we did.

03:18.130 --> 03:24.520
So again the short way you would do it something like this you would say the Asterix and then you would

03:24.520 --> 03:30.820
say margin zero again will we will gonna be adding more properties later on but you will do something

03:30.820 --> 03:35.680
like this where you would just say whatever I'm getting I want to get rid of all the default margins

03:35.770 --> 03:38.460
and just let me work from scratch.

03:38.550 --> 03:43.270
And this is again something you would normally do and this is something we will in fact do throughout

03:43.270 --> 03:44.390
the project.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.610
So let me again.

03:45.610 --> 03:46.150
You know what.

03:46.150 --> 03:51.400
Let me comment this or comment this out just so you know that this is an option but let's keep working

03:51.400 --> 03:51.970
with these guys.

03:52.450 --> 03:56.660
So now I have margin bottom zero as well as this guy now you know what.

03:56.680 --> 04:02.690
We can also maybe get rid of this and let's look at again whether we have the same options for shortcuts

04:03.280 --> 04:08.720
because we know our lead margin top margin left and all those properties are gonna be available to us.

04:09.010 --> 04:10.600
How often we'll use it.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.710
I have no idea in most cases.

04:12.790 --> 04:18.850
I think you are gonna go with either this one where there's going to be margin around or the top bottom

04:18.930 --> 04:20.090
and left and right.

04:20.110 --> 04:22.040
So why don't we practice on these ones.

04:22.180 --> 04:29.440
So let's say or here I'm going to say margin all around is gonna be I don't know 30 pixels or something

04:29.440 --> 04:31.530
like this or that would be the margin.

04:31.540 --> 04:33.630
And I'm also going to be working with the paragraph.

04:34.060 --> 04:42.670
So for the paragraph no let's try margin top bottom is going to be 50 pixels and I don't know 20 pixels

04:42.670 --> 04:46.290
left and right that would look something like this.

04:46.360 --> 04:53.830
And once we have a margin top bottom why don't we also try all four options where we have margin all

04:53.830 --> 04:57.650
around and for this we're going to say margin again.

04:57.700 --> 05:02.110
Let's look for some kind of values hundred pixels just so we can see.

05:02.200 --> 05:05.700
I don't know 20 pixels again left and right.

05:05.710 --> 05:06.910
I mean sorry.

05:06.910 --> 05:09.620
Right not left and right the bottom.

05:09.700 --> 05:14.170
Obviously we're not going to be able to see there's nothing here right now but let's just start again.

05:14.170 --> 05:15.750
Something like 20 pixels.

05:15.810 --> 05:20.770
And last but not least we're going to be looking at a right one where we can get again something like

05:20.770 --> 05:28.740
50 pixels what service and what do I have I have hundred so I have 20 and I have all around.

05:28.750 --> 05:32.650
So this is how the margin would work in the US as Box model.
