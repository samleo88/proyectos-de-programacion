WEBVTT

00:00.510 --> 00:01.340
Excellent.

00:01.350 --> 00:07.800
Our CSX journey finally has led us to media queries and the reason why media queries are so so cool

00:07.860 --> 00:14.910
in the CSX is because they allow us to work with responsive design and in a nutshell they allow us to

00:14.910 --> 00:21.600
style elements depending on a screen size so we can have different styles on different screen size and

00:21.600 --> 00:22.570
with the projects.

00:22.580 --> 00:28.440
There is obviously going to be more complicated examples with column sizes and all kinds of things.

00:28.440 --> 00:33.450
However for now I would just want to show you the basic example where there is going to be a div and

00:33.450 --> 00:35.430
what is going to work with some properties.

00:35.430 --> 00:40.620
Now with media queries we're going to be working with men with and Max with and again rule of thumb

00:40.620 --> 00:43.530
would be that men with is going to be starting from.

00:43.530 --> 00:49.480
So just remember this and the max would be up to you and in general we're gonna do mobile first.

00:49.540 --> 00:54.390
We're all going to start all our styling from the small screen and then we're gonna be adding the media

00:54.390 --> 00:56.610
queries as our screen size gets bigger.

00:56.880 --> 01:02.880
Because that would be probably easier than working with the desktop and then going the opposite direction.

01:03.270 --> 01:08.910
But as always we're going to see all this throughout this example and in the next session email again

01:09.000 --> 01:10.690
we're gonna do a very simple one.

01:10.800 --> 01:16.740
Going to say there's gonna be Dave we can maybe add this again some class and is Dave let's call this

01:16.740 --> 01:31.090
a binary and then within the heading One we're gonna say Hello world I'm learning I'm learning CSX learning

01:31.090 --> 01:38.190
CSX once this is going to be saved I mean obviously my writing at the moment is hideous but maybe we

01:38.190 --> 01:43.560
can fix this by adding this I mean this is gonna be a little bit better or we can just add the text

01:43.560 --> 01:50.070
capitalized that we already have learned and once we head over back to the CSX we can start styling.

01:50.280 --> 01:54.560
Well let's do some again awful examples with colors.

01:54.570 --> 01:59.910
We're gonna write out here body is going to be let's say background yellow again just so you can be

01:59.910 --> 02:05.130
mad at me and then once we have the background yellow how we're gonna go with the banner.

02:05.130 --> 02:11.140
So the day of that as a class a banner and I would like to add a I don't know background Blue Note that

02:11.250 --> 02:12.480
this is going to be my choice.

02:12.570 --> 02:16.210
Now last but not least I would like to head over to having one.

02:16.260 --> 02:22.790
We know that we can use the element selector and let's color white and text.

02:22.860 --> 02:26.010
Like I said let's do not text the line or you know what.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.450
Yeah maybe let's start out.

02:27.450 --> 02:35.220
Text center then we can do text declaration and add maybe another underline as well as we have an option

02:35.220 --> 02:42.780
of text and then here I would like to work not with the commemoration not with aligning not with shadows

02:42.780 --> 02:49.180
in fact or to want to work with text text text text text text transform sorry.

02:49.320 --> 02:55.830
And that was gonna be capitalization and this is how this text is gonna look like and this screen size.

02:55.860 --> 03:00.180
Now the thing is we haven't that the media squared so what's happening is and I'm going to show you

03:00.180 --> 03:03.790
right now on a bigger screen that regardless of the screen size.

03:03.920 --> 03:11.370
This is our Web page is going to look like and let's say we decide that OK this is perfect for mobile

03:11.370 --> 03:11.860
view.

03:11.910 --> 03:18.750
So once the screen size is small and this is awesome however as the screen size gets bigger I would

03:18.750 --> 03:20.600
like to change some things around.

03:20.670 --> 03:25.100
I don't think that my users would like the yellow color and maybe some other properties.

03:25.410 --> 03:25.960
Okay.

03:26.070 --> 03:27.250
So how do we do that.

03:27.420 --> 03:30.170
Well working with media queries the syntax would be like this.

03:30.180 --> 03:33.740
We need to have the ad and then we're looking for media.

03:33.810 --> 03:37.110
Now we need to write media and then we write screen.

03:37.110 --> 03:39.900
Now it is important the syntax here.

03:40.050 --> 03:46.200
Because if you're gonna make some kind of small even syntactical error your media query is not going

03:46.200 --> 03:46.820
to work.

03:46.860 --> 03:50.130
And maybe if I were going to remember I'm going to show you this.

03:50.250 --> 03:54.600
Once we set up the media query but even the smallest space is gonna matter.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.990
And trust me because I'm getting questions already on the course.

03:57.990 --> 03:59.640
So yeah this is happening.

03:59.640 --> 04:03.950
So you need to be kind of very careful about not that mean your side is gonna break.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.260
It's just your media query is not going to work.

04:06.270 --> 04:09.170
So here we're looking for men with and will be the syntax.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.140
And now we can use whatever values you would want.

04:12.140 --> 04:17.730
Now in my case I'm going to use pixels but again remember you can use our yams if you want or anything

04:17.740 --> 04:21.240
like like you would like and let's say here 576.

04:21.690 --> 04:29.460
So what I'm saying is starting from s 576 there is gonna be some kind of rules now that can be different

04:29.460 --> 04:30.050
roles.

04:30.150 --> 04:33.000
They can be the same properties with different values.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.420
This is really up to you.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.620
So let's start here.

04:35.700 --> 04:36.510
Let's say body.

04:36.690 --> 04:40.470
So starting from 576 what is going to happen to the body.

04:40.470 --> 04:45.210
Well designers suggest me that the body should be background red.

04:45.280 --> 04:45.730
OK.

04:45.790 --> 04:47.050
That's a good start.

04:47.050 --> 04:50.380
And then I'm going to be looking for a different background for the main.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.450
So I'm going to say not Main Street banner.

04:52.670 --> 04:56.970
So I'm going to write for the banner we would want background and let's say yellow.

04:57.210 --> 05:02.790
So I'm going to kind of not flip it technically because this is our label and then for the heading One

05:03.160 --> 05:05.770
and this is where I would like to add some more styles.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.190
So I'm going to stay here.

05:07.230 --> 05:13.380
I don't know what color is gonna be black and that I'm gonna be looking for the font size font size

05:13.380 --> 05:16.020
is gonna be I don't know 60 pixels.

05:16.170 --> 05:18.170
So basically this is gonna be massive.

05:18.260 --> 05:19.030
Okay.

05:19.130 --> 05:22.330
And we don't see anything there's no changes yet.

05:22.370 --> 05:29.970
But the thing is we are not past the 576 because again when we need to remember is that this notation

05:29.970 --> 05:35.760
means that starting from that screen size and since I don't want to mess up this view we all gonna head

05:35.760 --> 05:38.810
over again to the bigger browser and you can already see the changes.

05:38.880 --> 05:46.230
Now when the changes are happening now we can see that once the screen size is less than 576 the moment

05:46.230 --> 05:48.580
we're gonna get past five seventy six.

05:48.780 --> 05:51.060
Then we're gonna be getting new stuff.

05:51.110 --> 05:52.620
Now you want to see it a little bit more.

05:52.650 --> 06:00.000
We can do obviously as always our development tools and what happens here on the right hand corner you

06:00.000 --> 06:06.040
are probably seeing here the actual width of the screen now what's happening here this is saying five

06:06.100 --> 06:06.910
minutes.

06:07.200 --> 06:13.050
Now the reason why this is happening because obviously I have zoomed in here because I already have

06:13.050 --> 06:19.920
set up my zoom so if I'm gonna set my zoom to let's say a hundred like it normally would be and just

06:19.920 --> 06:25.740
for tutorial I think it's easier if we're gonna go actually again back to develop our tools you'll see

06:25.740 --> 06:28.040
that this is actually happening from 5 10.

06:28.440 --> 06:34.060
Now let me again make the smaller then we can do and this is not what I wanted to do.

06:34.290 --> 06:35.690
My apologies.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.130
We would need to go to 127.

06:38.500 --> 06:45.340
Then I'm going to open up my developer those and then we can start looking here that starting from 576

06:45.740 --> 06:46.940
the changes are going to happen.

06:47.270 --> 06:51.840
Well there is actually a little bit better way in the developer tools how we can notice that.

06:51.860 --> 06:55.130
So let me first make this again probably bigger.

06:55.710 --> 06:58.400
And you know what I can just make this one maybe small.

06:58.690 --> 06:59.480
And you know what.

06:59.480 --> 07:05.870
What I would want while here I would like to zoom in and not over here but in actual document.

07:05.870 --> 07:07.150
So let's zoom in.

07:07.190 --> 07:10.730
Two hundred and then in the developer tools notice what we're going to have.

07:11.270 --> 07:15.670
So we're gonna have the little thing where we can be looking at the screen sizes.

07:15.920 --> 07:22.580
Now what I have right now I have the width of 400 and then of height of five hundred nine.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.100
Now if I'm gonna be expanding this check it out.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.490
So starting from five seventy six what's gonna happen.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.950
Well I'm gonna see that we're gonna have our changes.

07:30.950 --> 07:36.230
So those are the kind of two things that if you need to know that within the developer tools if you

07:36.230 --> 07:39.560
want to check it out on different screen sizes you have this option.

07:39.680 --> 07:42.060
You don't have to do the normal way.

07:42.110 --> 07:47.060
However even if you're not doing this with the screen sizes you're still gonna be able to see we're

07:47.090 --> 07:51.740
just going to be hard to see because it's going to be probably written in a small tent or something

07:51.740 --> 07:52.670
like this.

07:52.670 --> 07:54.160
Now back to the media queries.

07:54.180 --> 07:54.620
Know what.

07:54.650 --> 07:58.630
Let me just close the variable tools and let's take for this one now.

07:58.970 --> 08:07.670
And like I said within the media query if I'm not adding this tax declaration underline if I'm not overwriting

08:07.670 --> 08:13.510
this in 576 what happens is that the underlying still stays.

08:13.520 --> 08:21.380
So even though I said that starting from 576 I would want some different property values on the heading

08:21.380 --> 08:25.720
One because I didn't have this tax declaration on their line here.

08:25.730 --> 08:30.710
This is the reason why it's still states and also have an option of adding the new property.

08:30.710 --> 08:36.090
However this new property would 60 pixels is only going to work from that 576.

08:36.260 --> 08:39.330
The moment we're going to be again back in the small screen.

08:39.350 --> 08:40.220
This is not going to work.

08:40.820 --> 08:46.010
Now we also have an option of adding as many media queries we would like to how this is going to work.

08:46.050 --> 08:49.280
Well we just copy and paste it and you know what.

08:49.370 --> 08:54.040
Before we do let me just do a little bit of undoing.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.020
Let me show you where would be the mistake.

08:56.090 --> 08:57.620
So what if I'm gonna do it like this.

08:57.680 --> 09:03.330
What I'm gonna say media screen and then in between the end and the actual parentheses.

09:03.500 --> 09:08.960
I'm not going to leave any kind of space do you think the media query is going to work or remember what

09:08.960 --> 09:13.390
I told you is that even the smallest mistake is gonna make the big difference.

09:13.430 --> 09:14.780
Now check this out.

09:14.900 --> 09:20.540
It doesn't matter how big the screen size gets the media query is not Morgan and we can refresh all

09:20.540 --> 09:21.410
day long.

09:21.410 --> 09:23.120
And this is not going to change.

09:23.180 --> 09:30.740
And the reason for that is because the smallest syntax error in this case even as simple as just leaving

09:30.740 --> 09:33.650
on this place and pretty much everything is going to be messed up.

09:34.010 --> 09:37.810
Now I can tell you right away my biggest issue is always writing something like this.

09:37.940 --> 09:43.110
So I do it something like this and then I'm looking for three days whereas might be a query and I'd

09:43.140 --> 09:47.900
understand whether it's a browsers fault or anything like that because obviously my spelling is not

09:47.900 --> 09:48.340
the best.

09:48.340 --> 09:51.040
So I always have issues with the with.

09:51.050 --> 09:56.960
That's just something from my book to let you know to maybe you so you can avoid it.

09:56.960 --> 10:03.740
And now let's go back and let's say I had another one and now this is gonna be the kicker where even

10:03.740 --> 10:08.900
this is gonna be starting from men with have so many sex in this case I obviously would want to have

10:08.900 --> 10:14.840
some bigger screen set so let's say this is not going to be seven I'm sorry five only six we're going

10:14.840 --> 10:21.000
to say seven 68 so once we get seven 68 then we're going to flip it around again.

10:21.030 --> 10:24.620
So here we can do green again for the body.

10:24.870 --> 10:28.460
The background for the banner is gonna be blue again.

10:28.890 --> 10:36.300
The color I don't know could be red red and maybe let's add some another property here but I'm just

10:36.300 --> 10:43.130
thinking what kind of property a crab with a text maybe let's do next a line and not center.

10:43.140 --> 10:50.840
We can do maybe right and that is gonna work out or you know even more fun when it's at a fun family

10:50.900 --> 10:51.860
of Verdun.

10:52.040 --> 10:56.120
So the moment we're gonna get to 768 then we're gonna get over Donner.

10:56.210 --> 11:00.150
Let me double check whether I corrected my mistakes that I did on purpose.

11:00.300 --> 11:05.020
Otherwise as I was laying to work and we're gonna head over right now to the bigger browser window.

11:05.150 --> 11:07.540
So we have less than five only six.

11:07.610 --> 11:12.690
The moment we get past 576 and obviously again in my case a 5 zoomed in.

11:12.780 --> 11:17.410
This is obviously going to be on a bigger screen size but as I keep going.

11:17.420 --> 11:21.370
Notice what happened the moment we get to 776.

11:21.410 --> 11:23.360
I have all kinds of things happening here.

11:23.810 --> 11:30.800
I have Verdun I have text right and I have the backgrounds and everything all that and this is again

11:30.800 --> 11:33.510
to show you that this is how we would work with media queries.

11:33.620 --> 11:40.160
Again very very basic example throughout the project we're gonna be using a lot more different properties

11:40.490 --> 11:44.350
and this is gonna look much better but the general idea would be like this.

11:44.510 --> 11:48.000
Now we also have an option of max width now for the max with.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.510
Let me just flip this around.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.800
So first of all I'm just going to comment this out.

11:52.310 --> 11:59.830
And then what we would want is the same syntax WE'RE ALL GONNA WRITE Max with know how the max with

11:59.840 --> 12:00.700
is going work.

12:00.860 --> 12:04.020
Well the max with is saying up to.

12:04.310 --> 12:10.650
So we technically flip this around since we already had here the rules.

12:10.800 --> 12:17.390
Wherever you see us as properties and values we are saying here up to this 576 we all gonna have these

12:17.390 --> 12:18.200
values.

12:18.260 --> 12:20.060
So these are gonna be the values that are being shown.

12:20.460 --> 12:24.700
However if we're going to get past 576 notice what happens.

12:25.070 --> 12:27.170
So these are our original styles that we wrote.

12:27.920 --> 12:34.760
So what we're saying here is up to the 576 and then we're gonna go back to whatever styles we wrote

12:34.760 --> 12:35.690
over here.

12:35.690 --> 12:41.050
Now one thing that we need to be careful with Max with is that we can easily overwrite this.

12:41.050 --> 12:47.600
So if I'm gonna comment this out again and if I'm gonna say Max with rom 768 and again let me select

12:47.600 --> 12:50.240
this here let's say Max.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.860
And this is not what I wanted to do.

12:52.580 --> 12:54.590
Let's say Max with.

12:54.740 --> 12:59.030
Now once I write 768 What do you think is gonna happen right now.

13:00.170 --> 13:06.080
I'm writing here up to five seventy six and then I have another Max with 760.

13:06.650 --> 13:09.800
So if I'm writing here up to 760.

13:10.100 --> 13:10.670
Do you think.

13:10.670 --> 13:15.240
Which style is going to be shown on the screen render in the browser.

13:15.260 --> 13:19.670
Well we can already see on the right hand side that this is gonna be the 768.

13:19.670 --> 13:26.580
And again the reasoning for that would be that we're saying the max with four five seventy but seven

13:26.580 --> 13:28.270
sixty eight includes this.

13:28.370 --> 13:30.300
So we're overwriting it anyway.

13:30.420 --> 13:31.350
What we are saying is.

13:31.360 --> 13:31.930
OK.

13:32.120 --> 13:32.570
Yeah.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.290
You said five Sony Six.

13:34.310 --> 13:40.880
Well what I'm saying is that I would like to have the 768 but again the interesting thing over here

13:40.880 --> 13:47.150
is even if I'm gonna change it here and if I'm gonna say I don't know 40 pixels I'm still gonna be getting

13:47.150 --> 13:48.010
this rally.

13:48.040 --> 13:54.130
So even though I'm writing here 768 I'm overriding this I don't know what the font size right.

13:54.470 --> 13:55.730
So that's what's happening.

13:55.730 --> 14:00.830
But let's start out with some kind of property that maybe is not affected in the banner.

14:00.830 --> 14:06.780
Now we already know the border radius more radius and that could be a. not 20 pixels.

14:06.860 --> 14:09.290
Now once I say it this is what happens.

14:09.890 --> 14:16.900
So that banner even though it is Max with up to five Sunni six we're still getting this right now.

14:16.970 --> 14:21.020
The border radius because we are not overwriting it over here.

14:21.020 --> 14:25.310
So this is gonna happen with the properties that we overwriting and this is the case where you need

14:25.310 --> 14:26.640
to be really careful.

14:26.660 --> 14:33.940
So if you're going to have some kind of properties here that you're not overriding this 768 then they're

14:33.950 --> 14:35.410
obviously still going to be shown.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.500
So that's something that you need to pay attention to.
