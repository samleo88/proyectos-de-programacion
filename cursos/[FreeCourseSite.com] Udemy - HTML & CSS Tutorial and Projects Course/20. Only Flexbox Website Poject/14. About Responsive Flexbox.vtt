Your here I wrote a comment that this is going to be responsive about that before our media queries

00:05.850 --> 00:11.700
so here I'm going to say this is going to be hashed out here at media and we're going to say screen

00:12.050 --> 00:17.510
here and we're going to say and and this is going to be men with hearing this.

00:17.550 --> 00:22.290
And then we're going to say this is going to be seven hundred seventy six pixels are going to see or

00:22.290 --> 00:29.520
hear soon 7 pixels like this and then we're going to address the rules and order here we're going to

00:29.520 --> 00:34.140
say that the whole about or here is going to be display flex.

00:34.160 --> 00:40.620
So the whole thing I'm going to say this play safe works here and I so we cannot see anything because

00:40.620 --> 00:42.970
this is not only six right.

00:43.140 --> 00:50.370
Then after that we're going to have a ABOUT text and on here we're going to say about and then use text

00:50.820 --> 00:53.380
and then we're going to say mean right.

00:53.460 --> 00:55.550
And this is going to be 40.

00:55.590 --> 00:57.360
You write more like this.

00:57.360 --> 00:57.630
Right.

00:57.630 --> 01:03.090
So the actual thing this guy or here is going to be 40 view right and then or here we're going to say

01:03.090 --> 01:09.080
this is going to be flex man or he'll going to have 0 0 0 Figaro.

01:09.120 --> 01:12.050
We wouldn't want it to grow that.

01:12.110 --> 01:16.760
This is going to be zero for the shrink which means that we wouldn't want to shrink.

01:17.040 --> 01:22.310
And we're going to say 60 percent or right and we're here 60 percent.

01:22.370 --> 01:28.020
And basically what's happening is that if we would want one for growth this would be growing and or

01:28.020 --> 01:30.450
here we would want one for sharing.

01:30.450 --> 01:35.760
This would be actually shrinking but we actually want both opposite don't grow and don't shrink.

01:35.940 --> 01:41.370
And this is going to be 60 percent or here we're going to have an about and we're going to say video

01:42.360 --> 01:42.680
right.

01:42.690 --> 01:47.220
So the other side and the other side we're going to do it pretty much the same.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.610
This is going to be 40.

01:48.720 --> 01:57.760
You hide or hear or help me say flex again zero for ground zero for shrink and 40 percent or so saying

01:57.780 --> 02:02.110
this over here and now let's go ahead and let's actually look what we have.

02:02.210 --> 02:07.590
So here if I'm going to go to a project and if I am actually going to refresh rate you can see that

02:07.590 --> 02:10.430
now they're actually going to be fought side by side.

02:10.530 --> 02:10.900
Right.

02:10.920 --> 02:18.260
And you can see that video is going to be less awkward here than on here the actual paragraphs and paragraphs

02:18.260 --> 02:22.000
over here are going to be more and the video is actually going to be worse.

02:21.990 --> 02:28.240
And now we are ready to move on and work on the next section which is going to be a services section.
