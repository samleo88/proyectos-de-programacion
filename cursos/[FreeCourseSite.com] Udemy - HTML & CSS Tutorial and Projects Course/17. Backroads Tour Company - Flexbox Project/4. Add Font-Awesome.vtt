00:00.210 --> 00:03.810
Since during the project we are going to use font awesome.

00:03.800 --> 00:04.260
Wow.

00:04.280 --> 00:06.900
We're going to have to include them in our project.

00:06.900 --> 00:11.740
So I'm gonna head over to a font awesome and font awesome being font awesome.

00:11.790 --> 00:17.010
Since the last project the station project they have changed their setup.

00:17.370 --> 00:22.410
So now if you'd like to get a CDM essentially a link that we can include.

00:22.410 --> 00:24.580
We're gonna have to sign up with an email.

00:25.020 --> 00:30.360
So in this case I'm not going to do that but in fact I'm gonna download it right away.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.560
The version of font awesome icon.

00:32.670 --> 00:37.680
The reason why I'm doing that is to show that we don't have to first of all sign up for the email even

00:37.680 --> 00:44.490
though you could get a CDM and also because you might watch this in the future when the font awesome

00:44.490 --> 00:46.510
version has already changed.

00:46.710 --> 00:52.620
So I'm working with five point nine but maybe you're already watching when the font awesome version

00:52.680 --> 00:55.130
is let's say 6 or 7.

00:55.170 --> 01:01.470
So in that case I would suggest getting exactly the same font awesome from.

01:01.470 --> 01:03.310
In fact the setup files.

01:03.530 --> 01:06.550
OK so what's going to happen within the setup files.

01:06.570 --> 01:09.380
I'm going to include also the font awesome.

01:09.640 --> 01:17.540
So the way we get Phantasm without signing up well we just downloaded it and then as you see there over

01:17.550 --> 01:26.120
the option of download Phantasm yes we would like to do that and I'm going to go for free for web like

01:26.130 --> 01:32.700
so then we downloaded and of course once we don't want it we also need to see how we would need to include

01:32.700 --> 01:34.460
it in our project.

01:34.950 --> 01:41.100
And in this case we just need to click on the link post font awesome yourself and what they're suggesting

01:41.100 --> 01:43.260
is that we have multiple options.

01:43.260 --> 01:47.870
If we would like users we g then we just need to look for all just file.

01:47.880 --> 01:52.710
If we just want to work with web funds now we're just looking for all CSX.

01:52.740 --> 01:58.850
Now let's head over back to our downloads and so downloads.

01:58.890 --> 02:05.330
And let me open this up and then once I open up the folder what I'm gonna do right now is again I'm

02:05.330 --> 02:11.240
going to copy and paste this folder so I'm going to copy it and then within the backroads I would like

02:11.240 --> 02:13.540
to copy paste it and that's number one.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.630
And second I'm also gonna copy and paste it within the setup files.

02:17.630 --> 02:20.630
So for those of you who are watching in this in the future.

02:20.630 --> 02:24.500
Again if you want to follow along the project exactly the same.

02:24.620 --> 02:31.220
I would suggest grabbing the font awesome folder from the setup all right and just set it up within

02:31.220 --> 02:32.270
your project.

02:32.270 --> 02:38.170
Now once we're done with that I said we just need to include the particular CSF file.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.570
But you do need to have that folder there.

02:40.670 --> 02:41.240
All right.

02:41.300 --> 02:49.260
So just make sure that the folder is there and then grab the all c assess or all J.S. from in fact phantasm.

02:49.370 --> 02:57.860
So the way we were gonna write that is by link and then we're look for Phantasm then for to seize this

02:57.860 --> 03:01.140
folder and then we're looking for all MNC assets.

03:01.310 --> 03:07.610
And since we also would like to start out with our different awesome has been added correctly.

03:07.610 --> 03:13.830
Now we're gonna go with I element and then let's look for class if a.

03:14.300 --> 03:20.270
And then maybe let's increase the size dramatically just so we can see that particular icon clearly

03:20.600 --> 03:24.760
and the classes F.A. AND I'M GONNA GO WITH FIVE TIMES BIGGER.

03:24.760 --> 03:25.110
OK.

03:25.490 --> 03:28.190
Let's say that and yet on the right hand side.

03:28.190 --> 03:29.090
There you go.

03:29.090 --> 03:35.030
We do have our font awesome so we have successfully added font awesome to our project.
