WEBVTT

00:00.840 --> 00:02.060
So far so good.

00:02.100 --> 00:03.900
We know how we can work with group.

00:04.260 --> 00:06.820
But let's imagine a little bit different scenario.

00:06.960 --> 00:12.720
So let's say I'm going to first delete this and we're gonna write heading one is gonna be titled heading

00:13.280 --> 00:14.480
idle.

00:14.820 --> 00:18.590
And then we're gonna need some kind of paragraph we're gonna say paragraph.

00:18.630 --> 00:22.650
And within the paragraph I don't know what what's place like 20 words or something like that.

00:22.800 --> 00:27.540
And then after the paragraph let's imagine there's gonna be another heading one more.

00:27.540 --> 00:30.450
This one is just gonna be I don't know food or hearing again.

00:30.560 --> 00:35.140
It doesn't really matter how we call this the main idea is gonna be very simple.

00:35.220 --> 00:42.180
So I would like to work with adding 1 and add some kind of styles only to the heading One and let's

00:42.180 --> 00:46.910
say the other heading one the further heading is gonna have a separate styles.

00:47.270 --> 00:52.200
Well first of all let me get rid of everything that I have for now in my style sheet and knowledge to

00:52.200 --> 00:53.480
decide how we're gonna do it.

00:54.150 --> 00:57.480
So only the title heading is gonna have specific styles.

00:57.480 --> 01:00.590
And then the footer heading mode have totally different styles.

01:01.120 --> 01:07.570
So how we would do this well in the Sear says we have an option of using the IDR.

01:07.650 --> 01:11.730
Now the way we work with the selector First we would need to create an idea.

01:11.930 --> 01:19.230
In my case I know that I would need to work with a attribute in my email which would be ideal and naming

01:19.230 --> 01:23.760
here is important because we all can I use it to actually select it in CSF.

01:23.850 --> 01:27.080
So let's call this I don't know a heading.

01:27.330 --> 01:31.650
And then also we can work with a hearing one we're gonna do that in a second.

01:31.710 --> 01:36.840
Once we understand how we can select this with the idea of having so far so good.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.010
So we have the idea with a value of having.

01:40.260 --> 01:46.180
Now once we go to styles assess if we would like to like this idea the syntax would be followed.

01:46.610 --> 01:51.890
So first we will go on and go with a hashtag and then we would need to come up with a name.

01:51.900 --> 01:56.700
Now when I say we would need to come up with a name that means that a name should match whatever you

01:56.700 --> 01:58.110
have here in the value.

01:58.170 --> 02:04.690
Otherwise if you gonna call this grandma Madea the CSX is not gonna be able to select it so in our case

02:04.720 --> 02:09.960
we know that we are selecting the heading and let's maybe use the color again properly and we're gonna

02:09.970 --> 02:11.740
say the color should be green.

02:11.910 --> 02:18.040
However let's also look at the other property that we can use for colors that would be for the background.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.820
And again we're gonna cover colors and literally few videos.

02:21.840 --> 02:28.760
However just remember that with a color what you're doing is you're selecting the color of the text.

02:28.960 --> 02:33.060
Then the background is gonna be self explanatory with a background.

02:33.490 --> 02:35.140
So let's say background should be.

02:35.170 --> 02:36.510
I don't know black.

02:36.670 --> 02:39.040
Now the moment we say with notice what happened.

02:39.160 --> 02:47.170
Only the heading be heading one that had the title of the heading has over here is background black

02:47.560 --> 02:49.430
as well as the color green.

02:49.450 --> 02:53.930
Now I can go back and I can change it and maybe let's call this title hiring.

02:53.950 --> 02:57.460
Maybe that should make more sense so I can write title.

02:57.470 --> 03:04.230
However the moment I changed the name or my value in the the attribute obviously the CSX is not anymore

03:04.240 --> 03:06.280
selecting because names don't match.

03:06.640 --> 03:11.420
So in our case again we would need to head over and let's say that this is gonna be the time.

03:11.440 --> 03:17.320
Now one thing with ideas what we should remember is the simple fact that they should be unique.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.150
What I mean by this.

03:18.400 --> 03:23.260
So let's say if we're gonna be working with the other heading the photo or heading we should have the

03:23.260 --> 03:30.580
I.D. our dad I.D. should match the I.D. that we already have currently on the page so I'm gonna call

03:30.580 --> 03:32.170
this here subheading.

03:32.290 --> 03:37.780
So instead of using again the title I.D. should be unique because there is other ways how we can work

03:37.780 --> 03:43.720
with SPSS in order to work with multiple elements together not just grouping the actual select.

03:44.410 --> 03:49.420
So that's something you should always remember that if you would like to use I.D. make sure that they

03:49.420 --> 03:56.090
are unique for that specific element meaning you're not reusing them somewhere around the actual page.

03:56.170 --> 04:01.750
Otherwise if the I.D. are not unique you're kind of losing the actual meaning of what is the reasoning

04:01.750 --> 04:02.900
for using data.

04:03.190 --> 04:07.810
Now if we have the subheading much changed around a little bit let's say again we're going to be selecting

04:07.810 --> 04:09.270
hub subheading.

04:09.370 --> 04:12.070
Now we know that the naming right now is correct.

04:12.070 --> 04:15.220
Maybe let's select these styles and let's just change this color.

04:15.250 --> 04:19.880
So instead of green one is gonna go with I don't text red.

04:20.080 --> 04:21.990
And then what we should use for the background.

04:22.570 --> 04:23.960
I don't know what to decide.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.640
So for the background we can use maybe gray.

04:26.770 --> 04:28.590
So let's test this out now.

04:28.690 --> 04:30.000
The moment we're gonna save it.

04:30.010 --> 04:35.490
Notice what the title lady we are selecting and background black and the color green.

04:35.490 --> 04:40.180
And for the subheading again we're using the added selector and we're saying that the background is

04:40.180 --> 04:42.670
gonna be gray and color is gonna be red.
