WEBVTT

00:00.690 --> 00:06.120
The first section we're going to be working on is going to be all here and this nav bar with the toggle

00:06.120 --> 00:10.580
button or here and the links like this.

00:10.580 --> 00:12.540
And also the banner.

00:12.680 --> 00:19.550
And since we're going to be using the flex box one for the whole header which is going to include nav

00:19.670 --> 00:23.120
and the banner we're going to do them together.

00:23.390 --> 00:26.990
And this is going to be the longest section and the most challenging section.

00:26.990 --> 00:27.300
Right.

00:27.440 --> 00:32.150
Once we actually start working with the skills it's going to be smooth sailing after we're done here

00:32.150 --> 00:35.630
with this one right because we're going to have a few things going on right.

00:35.630 --> 00:38.300
We're going to have a flex here.

00:38.360 --> 00:42.980
This is going to be a display or here or fixed or here like this right.

00:42.980 --> 00:48.980
So once actually the nav bar is in position then it is going and get this back run over here and it's

00:48.980 --> 00:53.480
going to be fixed and we're here also to have a toggle button right.

00:53.480 --> 00:58.070
So there's going to be few things going on that's why this is going to be the longest section of the

00:58.070 --> 00:58.940
project.

00:58.940 --> 01:02.010
So let's go ahead and let's actually start working on it.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.900
So here the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to delete this right.

01:05.990 --> 01:06.580
I'm going to delete.

01:06.590 --> 01:09.000
Hello world on the phone font awesome icon.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.100
So I'm going to get rid of this.

01:11.220 --> 01:11.520
Right.

01:11.540 --> 01:14.480
And we're going to make some more room here like this.

01:14.510 --> 01:20.190
So once we have everything open now the first thing that we would want to do is actually create a header.

01:20.540 --> 01:22.690
And once we have the header.

01:22.820 --> 01:24.850
And this is going to be a header element.

01:25.040 --> 01:29.070
Then we want to actually create a comment.

01:29.160 --> 01:32.020
So I'm going to say hetero's here more here let's say.

01:32.060 --> 01:35.550
And of over here.

01:35.880 --> 01:40.930
Now once we have the header the first thing that I'm going to say is this is going to be enough.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.360
And so this is going to be in the home.

01:43.620 --> 01:49.040
And the first thing in that element we're actually going to create or stop one.

01:49.190 --> 01:52.900
And so this is going to be a logo and this is going to be the Boston area.

01:53.100 --> 01:59.670
So what I'm going to say here and this is going to be of the class of that container is going to be

01:59.670 --> 02:01.710
the with the class of container.

02:01.890 --> 02:08.140
Once we have the div here then we're going to place an image and the image is going to have a source.

02:08.210 --> 02:11.540
Right we're going to go to images and then we're going to go to Lovo.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.920
So this is going to be our logo here.

02:14.160 --> 02:18.530
Once we have our logo let's say or here we're going to write a long go.

02:18.630 --> 02:19.530
Then we'll get right.

02:19.580 --> 02:21.210
That we would want a button.

02:21.270 --> 02:22.730
How do we create a button.

02:22.890 --> 02:25.970
So here I'm going to say this is going to be a div with the button.

02:26.250 --> 02:30.900
And then when the button we're going to have a three bars here I'm going to write and this is going

02:30.900 --> 02:36.000
to be a bar one here and this and then we need two more.

02:36.120 --> 02:40.940
So I'm going to select the line and copy and paste this one here this is going to be bar two.

02:41.010 --> 02:42.570
This is going to be bar three.

02:42.620 --> 02:48.240
Right now we cannot see this right now because obviously we need to use a C Ss to actually create them.

02:48.300 --> 02:52.360
Right now this is going to be it for the knife container.

02:52.510 --> 02:54.420
And so this was the container.

02:54.690 --> 02:58.860
And then we're going to work with rest of the and more here and we're going to say this is going to

02:58.860 --> 03:00.540
be on our list.

03:00.540 --> 03:06.910
I'm going to say now I've read the links right so this is going to be the class for our list or here

03:06.930 --> 03:11.640
where we're going to say that this is going to be a list item like this.

03:11.640 --> 03:18.360
So this is going to be a list item and then the list item there is going to be a link like this and

03:18.360 --> 03:20.270
this one we're going to call a ban.

03:20.330 --> 03:20.960
All right.

03:21.030 --> 03:23.390
So we're just going to say this is going to be home.

03:23.760 --> 03:30.060
But obviously since this is the target right we're going to be actually selecting all these elements

03:30.070 --> 03:35.010
right because you can see or hear that once we got to the bigger screen this is what we're going to

03:35.010 --> 03:40.250
have once we click over here there's going to be smooth scrolling to the section.

03:40.260 --> 03:43.440
This was the skills now is smooth scrolling through this section right.

03:43.530 --> 03:48.780
If we're going to about we're going to scroll over this section and this is why we need all here for

03:48.780 --> 03:50.230
these links to have a target.

03:50.450 --> 03:52.070
So here this is going to be the banner.

03:52.080 --> 03:52.740
Right.

03:52.830 --> 03:55.350
And I already know what section names are going to be.

03:55.350 --> 03:55.560
Right.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.000
So therefore I'm going to write them more here.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.100
But you are going to add them later.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.720
Right the actual sections.

04:01.740 --> 04:06.810
Therefore just right or here the section name if you're going to be using the same section names as

04:06.810 --> 04:12.120
I will we're not going to write home and then we can start to copy and paste this.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.890
And so we're just going to copy and paste this.

04:13.890 --> 04:16.030
And we need four more times.

04:16.050 --> 04:19.180
And obviously they're not going to be banner all of them right.

04:19.200 --> 04:25.260
So this is going to be skills and let's say we're here and we're going to do these more here.

04:25.270 --> 04:26.020
Right.

04:26.050 --> 04:31.800
And the third one we're going to say this is going to be about then over here we're going to write this

04:31.800 --> 04:33.350
is going to be projects.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.030
And the last one over here is going to be team.

04:36.220 --> 04:42.060
And so these are going to be section names or here again we can go in this banner because we don't need

04:42.060 --> 04:50.790
four of them and this and here we're going to say skills then another target is going to be about and

04:50.930 --> 04:52.240
here this is going to be the project.

04:52.240 --> 04:55.670
So these are obviously the ideas that we're going to add to the sections.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.000
All of them will have a..

04:58.050 --> 05:05.520
Now once we have this order here now once we have a list items with the team now we would want the icons.

05:05.690 --> 05:05.950
Right.

05:05.950 --> 05:08.520
So this was one on our list.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.720
Now I would want a second.

05:10.810 --> 05:11.250
Right.

05:11.430 --> 05:12.980
So we're going to say we're here.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.390
This is going to be on our list.

05:15.390 --> 05:20.350
We're going to say now of icons or hear press tab and now we have now of icons.

05:20.430 --> 05:23.810
So we're going to we're going to start with a list item here.

05:24.120 --> 05:31.080
Then in a list item or we're going to say that this is going to be a link like this once we have the

05:31.080 --> 05:31.770
link.

05:31.770 --> 05:37.740
This is going to be done I think I'm not going to be actually linking it on the Facebook but over here

05:37.740 --> 05:44.660
within the link We're going to have I know here we're going to say be over here we're going to write

05:44.660 --> 05:48.560
and this is going to be another class and all here we're going to leave it like this.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.430
All right then we press it on here.

05:50.430 --> 05:56.160
Now we do want to copy and paste this line and again we would want to do it three times one to three

05:56.630 --> 06:01.530
out here and let's use all here beautifier because this is going to be a little bit easier for us to

06:01.530 --> 06:02.040
see.

06:02.220 --> 06:07.710
So I'm going to select this and we can just find where it is beautifully here like this.

06:07.710 --> 06:11.370
And I can see that I have it's much more easier for me to work right.

06:11.440 --> 06:18.170
So know I'm going to say this is going to be a Facebook Facebook or here and you can see that we're

06:18.170 --> 06:25.590
using this new FHB or here right here and this is going to be Instagram this is going to be all here

06:25.660 --> 06:28.170
linked in LinkedIn.

06:28.550 --> 06:29.990
All right LinkedIn.

06:30.210 --> 06:38.030
You know I get this and then we'll have a Google Plus Google Plus or.

06:38.520 --> 06:46.250
Then once we have our bar and the button that we can see right now or here still within the header I

06:46.580 --> 06:48.030
would want a second child.

06:48.170 --> 06:49.770
And why I say a second child.

06:49.900 --> 06:52.310
So here you can see that this is not right.

06:52.460 --> 06:56.880
And what we're going to do is we're going to select this header has display flex.

06:56.900 --> 06:57.320
All right.

06:57.320 --> 07:02.290
So now is going to be the first child here and now we're going to create the second show right here

07:02.330 --> 07:02.870
this guy.

07:02.910 --> 07:03.430
All right.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.010
So this whole thing right.

07:06.230 --> 07:08.800
This cartoon here is going to be second child.

07:09.020 --> 07:13.700
And the card is actually going to be sitting in a banner and we're here and we're going to do is this

07:13.700 --> 07:18.920
was going I have and this is going to be the banner so we're going to have a class of Vanner and idea

07:18.920 --> 07:20.850
of banter or here like this.

07:20.860 --> 07:21.210
Right.

07:21.350 --> 07:29.720
So have dinner with class or an idea or here within the of the first is going to be a banner we're going

07:29.720 --> 07:32.780
to say card it's going to be the first day.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.650
And then within this day we're going to have a few things.

07:35.730 --> 07:39.760
We're here we're going to say this is going to be heading one and our heroes is going right.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.160
And this is going to be a cold war like this.

07:43.280 --> 07:43.960
Right.

07:44.010 --> 07:50.000
We can write it like this and then we're going to have a span within the span we're going to say Masters

07:50.840 --> 07:57.800
masters or here and maybe create a little bit of space in between right and then we would want a heading

07:57.800 --> 07:58.540
three.

07:58.700 --> 08:05.800
So going to having three and we're going to say that this is going to be mastering cold everywhere or

08:06.110 --> 08:07.250
here like this.

08:07.760 --> 08:15.800
And what's happening is over here now that we have a RHC amount now we're ready to go to main success

08:16.250 --> 08:17.690
and actually start styling.

08:17.690 --> 08:18.080
That's right.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.490
So the end result would be something like this.
