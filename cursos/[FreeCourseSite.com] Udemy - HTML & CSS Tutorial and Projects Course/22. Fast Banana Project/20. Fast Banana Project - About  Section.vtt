WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:04.810
And the next section we're going to be building is going to be about us.

00:05.220 --> 00:12.420
And just for a change and just so we know that actually everything is working on just more than one

00:12.420 --> 00:14.560
browser can see or hear to.

00:14.700 --> 00:17.870
Right now our files are open and Mazola right.

00:17.920 --> 00:24.240
So you can try that too if you're using Chrome right now just see that everything is working on both

00:24.240 --> 00:26.510
browsers and or here.

00:26.520 --> 00:30.260
This is what we're going to say we're going to say first you need your mouth.

00:30.500 --> 00:37.710
Someone to saying this is going to be about and I'm going to say section here then I'm going to select

00:38.100 --> 00:45.110
a comment copy and paste the comment in I'm going to say and of about it Item that.

00:45.200 --> 00:52.260
Well the first thing that I would want to do is actually have a section here with an idea of about and

00:52.260 --> 00:59.250
once we have the section now we would want the title now here we can just go here and actually get that

00:59.250 --> 01:00.090
title.

01:00.130 --> 01:05.860
So you're going to say that this is going to be a title and we're just going to copy it out here than

01:05.910 --> 01:07.140
once we're going to go down.

01:07.140 --> 01:13.690
Copy and paste and instead of future projects this is going to be a bolt section.

01:13.920 --> 01:21.320
So we're all going to say about us if we the witness what to say about us and we're here would you want

01:21.320 --> 01:22.800
to do is actually change the font.

01:22.800 --> 01:23.790
Awesome.

01:23.820 --> 01:31.320
So here we're going to say this is going to be user soon this is going to be a new user or you know

01:31.390 --> 01:37.600
once we have this now I would want to actually build the actual About section.

01:37.650 --> 01:45.230
So once the title is over first things first you're going to have a div here with an ID.

01:45.300 --> 01:48.710
So when I say hash tag and this is going to be about.

01:49.020 --> 01:51.990
And this is going to be center like this.

01:51.990 --> 01:56.970
Then we're going to have a two articles so the first one is going to be hard to go.

01:57.150 --> 01:59.310
And so here is our photo.

01:59.340 --> 02:05.010
So this is going to be I.D. with about photo price over here.

02:05.010 --> 02:11.790
Now we have our article out here we're going to have an image again press tab and we're going to have

02:11.880 --> 02:18.170
I'm going to be using a current project image so I'm seeing images here.

02:18.210 --> 02:23.760
And we're going to say worst current project and this and then look for alternative.

02:23.820 --> 02:24.680
Also going right.

02:24.690 --> 02:30.750
This is going to be current current project and you can see that the photo is actually going to be messing

02:30.750 --> 02:32.420
up our view for now right.

02:32.430 --> 02:38.400
Because you can see that this is going to be so big and obviously at the end all right on the finished

02:38.400 --> 02:40.010
version or you can see that.

02:40.190 --> 02:41.670
Well this is going to make it smaller.

02:41.910 --> 02:46.830
So don't worry about this right now it is just by default this big.

02:46.860 --> 02:47.550
Right.

02:47.640 --> 02:53.630
And then out here we're going to write another article and this article is going to be using a query.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.620
You.

02:54.930 --> 02:56.880
Right for security.

02:57.210 --> 02:57.540
Right.

02:57.540 --> 03:02.340
So therefore there is going to be a divide that we're actually going to be using for this.

03:02.360 --> 03:02.740
Right.

03:02.910 --> 03:04.630
So this is going to be our to go.

03:05.040 --> 03:13.950
So we're going to say Article Here article and for the article I would want a hash tag and we're going

03:13.950 --> 03:21.630
to say how about text about text press tab over here and now within the article would want the actual

03:21.630 --> 03:22.470
accordion.

03:22.770 --> 03:29.340
So here I'm going to say to Dave and on here we're going to say this is going to be hash tag be an accordion

03:29.700 --> 03:30.180
now.

03:30.300 --> 03:33.160
Obviously the actual idea can be whatever.

03:33.180 --> 03:33.480
Right.

03:33.480 --> 03:39.860
I'm just using the accordion idea because this is going to be what we're going to be getting from documentation.

03:40.140 --> 03:43.050
And it's just going to make a little bit more sense what we're doing.

03:43.050 --> 03:43.710
Right.

03:43.740 --> 03:45.340
So this is going to be our accordion.

03:45.450 --> 03:48.490
And for the accordion we need a heading.

03:48.630 --> 03:49.010
Right.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.090
So here is going to say press here for more info.

03:52.140 --> 03:58.330
Some say press here for more info or here.

03:58.450 --> 04:01.220
And then the next one is going to be the actual div..

04:01.600 --> 04:07.830
So we're all going to say Dave and we're really going to write that this is going to be Warum let's

04:07.840 --> 04:09.240
say 20 right.

04:09.310 --> 04:15.940
First time now we have a text and what we want is actually three of them.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.570
Three of these sets.

04:17.580 --> 04:21.330
All right so Dave including the headings so one two.

04:21.520 --> 04:21.830
Right.

04:21.850 --> 04:24.010
And now we have actually three of them.

04:24.340 --> 04:32.080
And this actually finishes the section about which you now would want to actually go ahead and style

04:32.080 --> 04:33.780
the About section.

04:33.820 --> 04:44.070
So what we can do is say read here and go to Maine say assess and start working with a About section.

04:44.110 --> 04:50.800
So what we're going to say here is we're going to have a we're going to scroll all the way in the bottom

04:51.100 --> 04:55.210
right mean this then or you are going to have some hashtags.

04:55.520 --> 05:03.220
And so we're going to make a comment and then we're going to say about section on this and what we're

05:03.220 --> 05:09.850
going to do or here is we're going to first start with an actual about how it's all going to start over

05:09.850 --> 05:11.420
here with the full section.

05:11.620 --> 05:15.100
And over here what I'm going to say and this is going to be Monheit.

05:15.340 --> 05:21.240
Now before we do that maybe it was about and let's do about four row and right away image right.

05:21.250 --> 05:25.230
Just so we can make it actually smaller so we can see what we're doing.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.540
So I'm going to say with an I'm going to say 100 percent.

05:28.740 --> 05:29.770
I really get this right.

05:29.800 --> 05:37.210
So now you can see that I got way smaller than I'm going to say border radius and I was going to say

05:37.210 --> 05:43.830
20 pixels on this and then I'm going to say a transition transform.

05:44.070 --> 05:51.010
It's all going to say transition and we're going to say transform transform and we're going to say two

05:51.010 --> 05:52.090
seconds each.

05:52.330 --> 05:54.070
And don't worry about this transition right.

05:54.070 --> 05:56.150
We're not going to write it right now.

05:56.270 --> 05:56.470
Right.

05:56.470 --> 06:00.890
We just said it all the properties and values for now for the image.

06:01.050 --> 06:06.910
And so we can see what's happening how we're actually standing here for about we're going to say hash

06:06.910 --> 06:14.600
tag about and you know the first thing we're going to say min height 19 View Heights this.

06:14.770 --> 06:17.810
Then after that we would want a padding.

06:18.070 --> 06:22.750
And I'm going to say batting 40 pixels here and zero.

06:22.780 --> 06:25.720
So just a bottom is going to be 40 pixels.

06:25.720 --> 06:30.250
And then you want a background and all we're here for in the background we're going to say like this

06:30.260 --> 06:35.200
we're going to say background we're going to say you are real and they use the same photo that I use

06:35.200 --> 06:36.030
those here.

06:36.390 --> 06:41.800
All right so here we're going to see images and then this is going to be current project 1.

06:41.950 --> 06:48.460
And so this is going to be the same background nor here we're going to write actually in a shorter version.

06:48.460 --> 06:49.040
Right.

06:49.120 --> 06:53.830
Because there's a shortcut for all the properties and remember how we're dealing with them right.

06:53.890 --> 06:57.340
When we had a background attachment position.

06:57.340 --> 07:04.600
Repeat size and all that right now we can write them actually much more faster by actually writing them

07:04.600 --> 07:05.210
in one line.

07:05.210 --> 07:08.260
And I'm going to make this smaller and just so we can see better.

07:08.260 --> 07:10.860
All right so first I'm going to place a position.

07:10.890 --> 07:14.770
This is going to be center and then we're going to have a size cover.

07:15.100 --> 07:21.620
And the rule is that you need to write the size after position and they need to be separated here by

07:21.630 --> 07:22.630
this world.

07:22.990 --> 07:29.360
Then over here we're going to write a no repeat which is going to start from bagong repeat this and

07:29.370 --> 07:35.260
then we'll have a background attachment fixed and it's all those four things you can basically write

07:35.300 --> 07:36.420
within four words.

07:36.440 --> 07:36.910
Right.

07:36.970 --> 07:44.290
But just remember this that the actual size needs to be after the position and or here what we can do

07:44.290 --> 07:47.050
is we can right away have a clip path.

07:47.180 --> 07:53.910
We used it before so I can say clip I'm going to say path or here and we're going to say polygon we're

07:54.040 --> 07:57.350
going on here and I going to we're going to make some shapes.

07:57.350 --> 08:00.770
All right so here we're going to make these shapes are here like this right.

08:00.790 --> 08:06.440
So this is a little bit higher than this one and this is over here a little bit lower than the side.

08:06.700 --> 08:12.030
So the way we do that we already know we start with 0 2 zeroes.

08:12.250 --> 08:15.470
Then we have a 100 percent on this.

08:15.550 --> 08:19.140
Then we have a 5 percent on this.

08:19.300 --> 08:22.400
And over here again we're going to have a hundred percent.

08:22.840 --> 08:30.250
So this is going to be the x value the Y Y O U X Y U right now it's 100 the y l you start to get lower.

08:30.250 --> 08:36.670
So this is going to be five then out here this is going to be actual hundred hundred here and you can

08:36.670 --> 08:37.720
see what happens right.

08:37.720 --> 08:42.300
So this is how it would look like if you'd have only three dots.

08:42.310 --> 08:46.990
But we have actually for real going to write 0 and we're going to write 95.

08:47.410 --> 08:48.930
So this is how we're going to look like.

08:48.940 --> 08:49.480
Right.

08:49.480 --> 08:55.870
So again these two corners and actually one is higher the other one is going to be or not.

08:55.920 --> 09:00.460
We have a clip path that's actually at a linear gradient.

09:00.770 --> 09:05.070
So here we're going to do again in front in here.

09:05.240 --> 09:10.020
I'm going to say gradient here and we can place right away.

09:10.190 --> 09:13.740
And over here what we do is actually work with this color.

09:13.830 --> 09:14.280
All right.

09:14.450 --> 09:19.150
So I'm going to say we're here hashtag FFC 9 1 4.

09:19.190 --> 09:21.730
Remember that was our yellow color.

09:21.740 --> 09:25.290
Now what I can do over here is I'm going to go with quick headed.

09:25.290 --> 09:30.290
All right so this is going to be a real color and I'm just going to go with G B and what I'm going to

09:30.470 --> 09:37.990
say or here is R G B A and or here we're going to place a comma and we're going to place a zero point.

09:38.390 --> 09:40.150
Let's say three right.

09:40.220 --> 09:43.370
So maybe you know what let's say five or six.

09:43.370 --> 09:44.030
Right.

09:44.060 --> 09:50.090
So what I'm saying is I would want a linear gradient right but I don't want all the time to have a black

09:50.090 --> 09:50.650
one.

09:50.880 --> 09:51.280
All right.

09:51.280 --> 09:55.980
Because we have a choice and we can actually use other colors too.

09:56.270 --> 10:02.440
So what I'm going to say or hand out a copy and paste this are G.P.A. this.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.910
Right now I can see that I have a yellow background right.

10:05.960 --> 10:10.130
So it all depends on a color note here also this depends on opacity.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.300
The higher this number is going to be right.

10:12.300 --> 10:14.300
This is you can see completely yellow.

10:14.420 --> 10:21.130
Now we don't want that let's say this is going to be 0.3 and this is going to be much easier 0.3.

10:21.140 --> 10:29.370
Now once we're done with an actual about what we would want or here right now we would want about Center.

10:29.530 --> 10:29.940
Right.

10:29.970 --> 10:35.570
The idea of actually holding these two things inside here and again we're going to do the same thing

10:35.570 --> 10:40.380
as always we're going to say about what we're going to say center right.

10:40.400 --> 10:45.270
So this is going to be the one that actually has them both right.

10:45.290 --> 10:49.520
So this is the knave and articles are two children.

10:49.520 --> 10:54.410
So we're all going to say about Center and first we're going to have a max.

10:54.590 --> 10:58.360
I'm going to say Max with Max what is going to be 90.

10:58.430 --> 11:01.000
You with us like this.

11:01.010 --> 11:03.760
All right so now I can see that we got the 9 out of this guy.

11:03.950 --> 11:09.230
Now I would want to place it in the center so we're going to say marginata again right now we actually

11:09.230 --> 11:14.890
place them side by side in the center and then once we're actually done with an image.

11:15.030 --> 11:15.590
All right.

11:15.610 --> 11:18.800
We already wrote an image because that will be the next thing.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.710
So let me just cut this one out and paste it over here.

11:22.820 --> 11:27.950
And remember I said through transition and what we would want for and position we would want to scale.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.440
So it actually would zoom out right.

11:30.440 --> 11:37.900
So we're going to say about photo image however you know this and what should happen.

11:38.120 --> 11:47.990
So we're going to say transform and we're going to say scale here zero point eight like this and we're

11:48.080 --> 11:50.250
going to place a semi colon.

11:50.570 --> 11:56.180
So when's it going to happen is that as you can see hovering right and actually it gets smaller and

11:56.180 --> 11:59.450
then all hear from both of them we would want a little bit of margin.

11:59.650 --> 12:05.360
So I'm going to say over here about we're going to say row and over here we're going to say this is

12:05.360 --> 12:06.670
going to be next.

12:06.990 --> 12:11.840
So I'm going to say him about an intercept text right from both of them.

12:11.850 --> 12:19.940
We will do what Jim one just so I'm going to say we're here again and we're going to say 40 pixels here

12:20.090 --> 12:21.640
and 0.

12:21.680 --> 12:28.880
Now since this is all going to be styling once we get the actual J query we're going to go ahead and

12:28.880 --> 12:31.010
actually apply right away.

12:31.070 --> 12:33.860
A rules for responsiveness.

12:33.930 --> 12:34.220
Right.

12:34.220 --> 12:41.570
Because if I say this all here like this I can if I go to my recording and if we show him right you

12:41.570 --> 12:47.620
can see that right now I have one big image right here where my accordion is still not done right.

12:47.630 --> 12:52.580
So first let's add a responsiveness and then we're going to deal with the actual accordion.

12:52.570 --> 12:55.740
We're going to have to get Google CDN and all that.

12:55.740 --> 13:02.570
So let's first acquire responsiveness of this and what we're going to say or here that we would want

13:02.660 --> 13:12.440
a year here and we're going to say screen screen over here and we're going to say and and then all really

13:12.490 --> 13:22.040
going to write like this we're going to say this is going to be men with five 576 or 776 1776.

13:22.430 --> 13:27.020
Then after that we would want a about Center Center.

13:27.170 --> 13:33.380
And over here we're going to say this play I'm going to say flex I want to display flexible going to

13:33.380 --> 13:41.390
suggest the fat content space between here and we're going to have a line content and we're going to

13:41.390 --> 13:42.100
say something.

13:42.130 --> 13:43.190
All right.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.010
So again we can say this.

13:45.020 --> 13:48.550
Let's go back to recordings and let's see what we are right now.

13:48.590 --> 13:50.990
Both of them are actually side by side.

13:51.020 --> 13:54.580
Now what I would want to do is actually go back over here.

13:54.690 --> 14:03.050
We're going to say about a text and we're going to say about I don't want to say photo and so here we're

14:03.050 --> 14:03.950
going to write like this.

14:03.950 --> 14:14.240
All right so both of them once the screen gets bigger and 776 let's say flex 0 0 and 0 0 and this is

14:14.240 --> 14:17.090
going to be Kelk function or here again right.

14:17.090 --> 14:20.240
So this is going to be 50 percent minus.

14:20.420 --> 14:26.780
And again Wanny is that's arbitrary you can use Ousley pixels but it's just for me it's a little bit

14:26.780 --> 14:29.260
easier once you can go in just with one hand right.

14:29.650 --> 14:33.690
And or here on Swissair was a chicken and what we have right.

14:33.730 --> 14:36.400
So here we have both of them right.

14:36.440 --> 14:41.320
But then I would want or hear this accordion about text actually place it in the center.

14:41.330 --> 14:43.350
We already know how to do that.

14:43.400 --> 14:43.640
All right.

14:43.640 --> 14:50.390
So we're going to go back over here about moosic text and this and then we're going to say this is going

14:50.390 --> 14:57.000
to be a online self and we're going to say something like this.

14:57.010 --> 14:57.360
All right.

14:57.380 --> 14:59.210
And before we go have a look.

14:59.450 --> 15:05.900
Let me actually add two more selectors that we're not going to be tackling right now right because like

15:05.900 --> 15:11.470
I said we still need to get that accordion but we're really going to say we're here is class you high.

15:11.630 --> 15:14.420
This is going to be our accordion.

15:14.610 --> 15:21.140
We're here at our Andr and legis have a curly braces no real going out.

15:21.190 --> 15:28.180
A You I don't know where this is going to be accordion and all of this is going to be another class

15:28.500 --> 15:33.230
you high accordion and content.

15:33.520 --> 15:33.870
Right.

15:33.880 --> 15:38.020
And again like I said we're going to be styling them in the next video because then I'm going to be

15:38.020 --> 15:40.970
able to show you where I'm actually getting these correct classes.

15:41.020 --> 15:41.840
Right.

15:41.860 --> 15:45.600
Once we save this remember that we have aligned so Center.

15:45.880 --> 15:51.700
And once we refresh all here right now here you can see that everything is working right.

15:51.730 --> 15:57.380
The only thing left over here to get this accordion and make the accordion start working.
