WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:04.610
And now that we are in our services see rates are Mengesha assessed.

00:04.610 --> 00:11.460
However you can see that we have a comment services now it starts styling services and we're going to

00:11.460 --> 00:18.710
select all services services here we're going to say padding 40 pixels.

00:18.730 --> 00:20.860
When you consider what happened right.

00:20.910 --> 00:22.730
So the padding went all around.

00:23.010 --> 00:26.140
Then after that we're going to have a background here.

00:26.280 --> 00:31.410
And you know just let's leave the magnet away right because we already have the background for the whole

00:31.410 --> 00:33.750
body so we can just skip this one.

00:33.750 --> 00:37.360
So we're off today and what we would want is target the actual service.

00:37.380 --> 00:42.030
And what I want to do is place this font awesome with this text right.

00:42.150 --> 00:45.800
Because if you remember we place them in two separate divs right.

00:45.810 --> 00:47.530
Or here if you remember.

00:47.550 --> 00:50.870
Here we have a single service right here.

00:50.940 --> 00:53.100
This was the service over here.

00:53.130 --> 00:55.850
First was the icon and then was the text.

00:55.910 --> 00:59.170
Right so we purposely have them side by side or here right.

00:59.220 --> 01:01.170
So we don't have any more elements.

01:01.220 --> 01:07.200
So we're now the only thing we need to do over here as I'm going to say sir is this and I'm going to

01:07.200 --> 01:10.760
say that this is first of all this is going to have a margin.

01:10.880 --> 01:14.800
Top bottom 30 pixels over here then zero on the sides.

01:14.800 --> 01:15.450
All right.

01:15.540 --> 01:18.790
And then we're going to say very simply display flex.

01:18.860 --> 01:21.020
Now I can see right away what happened right.

01:21.060 --> 01:25.310
So the phantasm is side by side with that text.

01:25.320 --> 01:32.160
Now obviously we need to add more styles but this is the most simplest and easier easiest way how to

01:32.160 --> 01:32.810
do it.

01:32.960 --> 01:40.470
So here I'm going to say service here and I'm going to say I can I can and then I'm going to say for

01:40.980 --> 01:41.360
it.

01:41.520 --> 01:47.880
So now that we have that we're going to say font size 60 pixels right.

01:47.910 --> 01:52.830
So right away first what happened we added some font sizes that are going to have a color.

01:52.890 --> 02:00.020
And again we're going to use the blue color so this is going to be to be 9 8 0 0 like this.

02:00.090 --> 02:04.390
And then we're going to have a margin know where we're going to say margin right.

02:04.740 --> 02:06.740
Let's say on here 20 pixels.

02:06.820 --> 02:09.190
Right so we got a little bit of margin.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.990
And don't be discouraged right.

02:11.010 --> 02:16.380
If you see something like this because what's going to happen is that are some actual high cards right.

02:16.380 --> 02:17.400
There's a difference right.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.520
What kind of icon.

02:18.520 --> 02:19.160
That's right.

02:19.170 --> 02:21.870
So don't worry about this what you're actually seeing or hear.

02:21.870 --> 02:22.360
Right.

02:22.410 --> 02:27.900
So if there's a marginally different than the other one is right because the actual size 0 here is also

02:27.900 --> 02:28.690
different.

02:28.800 --> 02:34.620
And after that we're going to have a service here in fall and what we're going to say or here this is

02:34.620 --> 02:41.390
going to be a margin and we're going to see margin on top and we're going to say 10 pixels.

02:41.420 --> 02:42.840
Well that's right.

02:42.840 --> 02:48.210
So basically what I'm saying is I would want margin on here for this paragraph and here I'm going to

02:48.210 --> 02:56.010
say line height and we're going to again say 1.5 year then after that we're going to have for the actual

02:56.670 --> 02:57.530
hovering effect.

02:57.540 --> 02:58.030
Right.

02:58.230 --> 03:03.990
So what I'm going to say here that if I'm actually hovering over them right something should actually

03:03.990 --> 03:04.950
change.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.720
So I'm going to say service we're here and then I'm going to say that I would want to have a hover.

03:11.940 --> 03:12.590
All right.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.080
And that I would say fantastic.

03:15.460 --> 03:20.720
And then after that I'm going to say that I would want to service well here.

03:20.760 --> 03:24.690
And again I'm going to say however I know we're going to.

03:24.690 --> 03:31.370
This is going to be service subtile subtitle over here and what should happen.

03:31.590 --> 03:36.450
So we're going to go back over here and we're going to say color and all this is going to go back on

03:36.450 --> 03:37.110
here like this.

03:37.110 --> 03:44.510
Our B 0 0 0 0 and this is going to be zero point eight.

03:44.630 --> 03:45.250
Right.

03:45.330 --> 03:51.050
So here what's going to happen as we're actually hovering right you can see that actual colors are changing

03:51.060 --> 03:51.590
right.

03:51.630 --> 03:53.850
So the color is changing for those guys.

03:53.850 --> 03:54.530
Right.

03:54.540 --> 03:56.610
And also for the actual font.

03:56.610 --> 03:57.600
Awesome.

03:57.750 --> 04:04.820
Now that when this is actually done right you can see that I actually forgot the stylus subtitle.

04:05.010 --> 04:08.110
I went right away from phantasm right away.

04:08.250 --> 04:13.420
So here we actually need to add a service subtitle.

04:13.500 --> 04:19.810
So this is going to be heading to I don't know really going to say text really transform when you say

04:19.830 --> 04:20.550
capitalized.

04:20.550 --> 04:26.330
First of all then we're going to have a caller and I will going out another note blue color.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.710
So are you going.

04:27.720 --> 04:32.970
This is going to run this color copy paste.

04:33.000 --> 04:41.100
Right now we have the color and then we'll get our font size of 20 font size 20 pixels of this right.

04:41.250 --> 04:44.480
But the point is as I'm hovering You can see what's happening right.

04:44.520 --> 04:52.520
So basically service however right here then this is actually happening as I'm hovering over the service

04:53.790 --> 05:00.760
the icon and text both black then after that you're going to save for the service info.

05:00.780 --> 05:03.290
This all shows should turn different colors.

05:03.540 --> 05:11.720
So I'm going to say service over here or here I'm going to say service and this is going to be painful.

05:11.770 --> 05:19.360
So this is going to be the paragraph this is going to have a color of our G-B on here like this.

05:19.410 --> 05:24.760
This is going to be 1:47 1:47 1:47.

05:24.930 --> 05:26.250
So basically great.

05:26.580 --> 05:35.580
Remember with our G-B we had zero to 2:55 255 is white Zero he's black so gray would be somewhere in

05:35.580 --> 05:36.560
the middle right.

05:36.660 --> 05:37.900
Again we save this.

05:38.010 --> 05:44.360
And the point is that as I'm hovering over the whole thing right then these guys turn black over here

05:44.370 --> 05:44.980
right.

05:45.060 --> 05:47.320
And these guys going to actually turn right.

05:47.530 --> 05:52.100
So now we're ready to go on and actually at a minute queries right.

05:52.140 --> 05:53.880
So there's actually a response.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.870
So they're not displayed like this right in line.

05:56.880 --> 06:00.550
But as the screen gets bigger they actually get side by side.
