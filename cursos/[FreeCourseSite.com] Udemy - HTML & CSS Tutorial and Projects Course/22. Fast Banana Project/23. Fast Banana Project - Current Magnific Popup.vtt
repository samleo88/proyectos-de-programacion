00:00.400 --> 00:08.760
An for light box we're going to be using a magnifique papa irresponsive Jake with a light box which

00:08.760 --> 00:15.580
is basically the best one in my opinion especially for the ones that are free.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.730
You can see the ones with clicking.

00:17.740 --> 00:18.590
All right.

00:18.660 --> 00:26.330
And we have examples that we have a gallery and here we have documentation on here this would be good.

00:26.630 --> 00:30.360
So let's start over here with a documentation Morier.

00:30.540 --> 00:34.050
So first things first they say we need to include these files.

00:34.080 --> 00:34.770
Right.

00:34.800 --> 00:41.970
So here we need a magnetic pop ups who and we need to jack Querrey which we already have don't worry

00:42.420 --> 00:50.790
and use that and or here they're saying a just fine then over here they say how we can start the actual

00:50.790 --> 00:51.670
pop up right.

00:51.810 --> 00:57.120
So here you can see we still have the document ready function and or here we say image link.

00:57.150 --> 00:59.380
And this would be type image.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.250
This will be if we would want to do this way.

01:02.450 --> 01:02.800
All right.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.240
So here like this right.

01:04.260 --> 01:07.970
So let's say image or here or here this is going to be the path.

01:07.980 --> 01:14.470
So we basically have just a simple click and once we press it here this is going to open up in a light

01:14.470 --> 01:15.310
box.

01:15.330 --> 01:21.550
However we're going to pick a second version where we have a container.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.900
All right then we have the links.

01:23.910 --> 01:26.300
Remember how we have it right now.

01:26.310 --> 01:30.490
We also placed an image or here inside just for our layout.

01:30.630 --> 01:31.230
Right.

01:31.240 --> 01:34.990
However osing really needed this 2:02 image right.

01:35.040 --> 01:40.760
So you don't need if you really just want a links that would open up the gallery right.

01:40.980 --> 01:45.470
You can just have a simple gallery how are we placed our links inside here.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.990
I'm sorry our are images right.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.850
Just so we have actually this section.

01:50.200 --> 01:50.530
Right.

01:50.580 --> 01:53.670
Just for the section's sake we have these images over here.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.990
So we had a little bit of extra spice.

01:57.000 --> 01:57.540
All right.

01:57.720 --> 02:02.970
So we're going to do first is let's go ahead and let's actually download right so we can go back over

02:02.970 --> 02:08.030
here and we're going to see where's the good hub here then.

02:08.110 --> 02:15.000
We're going to is we're going to do a clone or download it on say download the zip or this and then

02:15.420 --> 02:18.870
it's going to be in our notes like this.

02:18.960 --> 02:25.510
We can just open up the actual folder under the distribution.

02:25.680 --> 02:26.420
Right.

02:26.700 --> 02:32.840
We're going to have a success and I'm going to have a genius what I'm going to do here.

02:33.330 --> 02:40.110
I'm going to have a new folder which is going to called magnifique here and let's drag this guy over

02:40.110 --> 02:40.600
here.

02:41.010 --> 02:48.690
And again we have a choice of men or actual regular Just so just for the sake of saving a little bit

02:48.690 --> 02:52.390
of space right let's have a minute fight.

02:52.500 --> 02:58.080
What I'm going to do here I'm just going to drag this folder to our folder where we work and that pretty

02:58.080 --> 02:59.510
much is done.

02:59.600 --> 03:07.320
And then after that what you would want to do is go in right away actually set everything up so it can

03:07.320 --> 03:09.540
cause the script in the index.

03:09.540 --> 03:09.780
Right.

03:09.780 --> 03:12.400
I'm going to go all the way to the bottom right.

03:12.630 --> 03:20.790
And let's say over here before our script what I'm going to say here is that this was wrong.

03:20.930 --> 03:25.680
All right what I'm going to say here I'm going to say that this is going to be a magnifique.

03:25.830 --> 03:32.640
And once I have a comment on here I'm going to say this is going to be script here tab and you can see

03:32.640 --> 03:33.330
or hear.

03:33.450 --> 03:40.940
I have my magnifique fold over here I'm going to say source then we're going to have to have a magnifique

03:41.770 --> 03:44.760
here and then we need a yes.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.640
Right so this is going to be the javascript file.

03:47.660 --> 03:53.930
Now we can say this now I need to scroll all the way up and over here let's say after the break where

03:53.930 --> 03:54.560
you.

03:54.770 --> 03:59.400
I'm going to I'm going to make a comment and we're here we're going to say this is going to be magnifique

04:00.350 --> 04:05.080
pop up says yes we're here we're going to have again.

04:05.130 --> 04:10.710
We're going to have a link right relationship style sheet and we're here we're going to say magnifique

04:11.070 --> 04:11.610
again.

04:11.970 --> 04:14.560
And let's say we're here we're going to have success.

04:14.940 --> 04:20.940
So I'll say this but then we're going to go back to the bottom right because what I don't want to place

04:20.940 --> 04:25.540
it in my script right because I don't want to keep mixing them up.

04:25.710 --> 04:30.840
So we're all going to say we're here is that this is going to be a script right.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.140
Magnifique.

04:32.490 --> 04:34.580
I'd say magnifique James.

04:35.030 --> 04:36.630
No chance.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.160
I'm not going to say we're here.

04:38.250 --> 04:42.420
We're just going to create a not magnifique pop up Mingy.

04:42.740 --> 04:50.530
But we're going to go to this folder we're here and let's say that we're going to say a new file.

04:50.550 --> 04:53.740
We're going to say Mark Afiq or here.

04:54.730 --> 04:59.470
All right so now we're here in this folder we have a Magnificat James.

04:59.630 --> 05:05.400
No really if we go back to the next page the amount here and let's say again we're going to have a script

05:06.060 --> 05:08.490
and here we're going to write a source.

05:08.970 --> 05:10.990
So here and this is going to be so harsh.

05:11.190 --> 05:13.210
I know we're going to see him again there Frank.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.590
And we're going to have a magnifica James.

05:15.590 --> 05:17.430
All right so this is going to be our custom.

05:17.430 --> 05:18.120
Yes.

05:18.150 --> 05:19.280
So now I'm going to say this.

05:19.350 --> 05:20.730
And now we're going to go back over here.

05:20.750 --> 05:21.240
Right.

05:21.420 --> 05:24.130
So this was the get happen this is where we download it.

05:24.540 --> 05:30.360
Now the next thing that we would want to do is actually go back to documentation.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.220
All right.

05:31.220 --> 05:32.960
And let's actually start.

05:33.030 --> 05:33.720
Right.

05:33.800 --> 05:38.180
So the first code that I'm going to copy to this one is going to be this document ready.

05:38.180 --> 05:38.450
All right.

05:38.460 --> 05:42.410
So we can do it here and we obviously can read it ourselves.

05:42.420 --> 05:48.210
But I'm just showing you that sometimes it's just you know sometimes you just copy and paste the code

05:48.630 --> 05:50.880
right and all hear what I'm going to do.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.310
Just delete this line right.

05:52.380 --> 05:52.810
Right.

05:52.980 --> 05:57.990
So basically again it could have easily written ourselves I'm showing you where I'm getting this from.

05:57.990 --> 06:03.420
So this was a document ready so basically all our code is going to run only when the document is ready.

06:03.420 --> 06:07.700
Now we're going to go back over here and we're going to get this line right.

06:07.710 --> 06:12.720
So basically what saying if we have this right this is how we would want.

06:12.750 --> 06:17.040
So what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to copy and paste this.

06:17.070 --> 06:17.560
Right.

06:17.850 --> 06:24.620
And what is it saying is first it's selecting something writing that selecting class with parent container.

06:24.660 --> 06:29.980
Now in our case what does the parent container it's current center.

06:30.110 --> 06:30.330
Right.

06:30.350 --> 06:33.010
Because then it's current item current item right.

06:33.020 --> 06:34.470
So this is the parent element.

06:34.820 --> 06:39.740
So I'm going to go back over here and what we're going to say is this is going to be current center.

06:39.740 --> 06:41.980
And if I'm correct this was a off.

06:42.000 --> 06:42.570
All right.

06:42.740 --> 06:49.970
This was an idea around I'm going to say Center is double check because I can tell you right away you're

06:49.970 --> 06:51.890
not going to be making mistakes here.

06:51.920 --> 06:58.240
In most cases you're mostly going to be making mistakes just by selecting the actual correct items right.

06:58.250 --> 06:59.170
Whether it's a class.

06:59.170 --> 06:59.770
Right.

06:59.780 --> 07:03.710
So make sure that it is an idea that you're using so it's current center.

07:03.710 --> 07:07.380
And over here I'm going to write and this is also going to be a magnifique.

07:07.380 --> 07:08.470
All right currents.

07:08.480 --> 07:16.010
And now once we have this right magnifica pop up we have delegate a and here we have type image.

07:16.010 --> 07:22.450
Now let me say this here and now what we need to do because it is javascript.

07:22.470 --> 07:24.480
All right we need to refresh here.

07:24.770 --> 07:30.560
And once I click it over you're right you can see that I'm not going back to the image right where it's

07:30.560 --> 07:31.290
located.

07:31.370 --> 07:34.010
You can see or hear right that I have a lightbox.

07:34.130 --> 07:36.360
Now I don't have the gallery.

07:36.470 --> 07:39.830
I just have the actual image so if I go an image I click it.

07:39.830 --> 07:41.450
Right now I get an image.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.090
So I'm going to go back over here and let's check it out.

07:44.090 --> 07:46.120
What other options we have.

07:46.120 --> 07:46.590
All right.

07:46.730 --> 07:52.670
So if we're going to be scrolling down right we're not going to be covering obviously all these right.

07:52.730 --> 07:55.370
What we're interested in is actually gallery right.

07:55.400 --> 08:01.160
So here we just keep scrolling scrolling down right and are here for Gallerie what they're saying is

08:01.700 --> 08:03.490
Gallery enabled.

08:03.710 --> 08:05.320
And what we need is true right.

08:05.360 --> 08:10.000
And again we can copy this or we can actually write it ourselves.

08:10.010 --> 08:11.660
It doesn't really matter.

08:11.660 --> 08:16.250
All right so here we're going to place a comment because this is an object and on here we're going to

08:16.250 --> 08:19.480
copy and paste it it's a gallery enabled.

08:19.490 --> 08:19.960
True.

08:20.150 --> 08:25.210
And then we need to get rid of this camera and because this is the last item on here right.

08:25.430 --> 08:26.890
So we can do it here.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.280
Can you just say this.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.390
And again we're going to go back over here.

08:30.650 --> 08:34.960
You can refresh the page and sure enough you can see or hear these arrows.

08:34.970 --> 08:39.710
Now I have my gallery so I can skip through the gallery like this.

08:39.980 --> 08:45.570
And this is how we can actually add a Magnificat pop up right to our project.

08:45.680 --> 08:50.510
And like I said from the free ones that's that's actually the best one to work with.

08:50.510 --> 08:53.120
It's actually the easiest one like you see it right.

08:53.120 --> 08:59.320
It has again a lot of options that we didn't touch on because like I said without a lot of these J-20

08:59.330 --> 09:02.230
plug ins you can make another tutorial out of this one alone.

09:02.240 --> 09:02.960
Right.

09:03.050 --> 09:10.820
Because we are mostly mainly focusing on actually working with CSSA and fluxbox and the grid and the

09:10.920 --> 09:11.780
fluxbox.

09:11.780 --> 09:16.560
So we're here this is just a matter of next how to make our project to stand out.

09:16.580 --> 09:23.470
Therefore this section was kind of simple one right just so we don't get mixed up with a magnifique

09:23.480 --> 09:28.740
pop up here which is not hard because remember that you need to do right.

09:28.970 --> 09:31.260
You just need to add both of them.

09:31.310 --> 09:32.100
Right.

09:32.180 --> 09:36.310
And so here again we technically could have done it in a script.

09:36.420 --> 09:37.070
Right.

09:37.130 --> 09:39.920
I just wanted to put it in the separate files.

09:39.980 --> 09:44.960
So then whenever you are going to be opening your source files you know what is what.

09:45.030 --> 09:48.150
Or here and now we really want to the next section.
