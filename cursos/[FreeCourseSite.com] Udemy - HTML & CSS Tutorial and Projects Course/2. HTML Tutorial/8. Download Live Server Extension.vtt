WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:06.560
Now another nagging thing about our first webpage is all the manual labor that we need to do.

00:06.600 --> 00:07.710
Now what do I mean by that.

00:08.100 --> 00:14.160
Well let's say that in my first webpage I would like to change from hello world to Hello people.

00:14.160 --> 00:15.390
Well we can definitely do that.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.960
So again we're going to head over back to our document.

00:17.970 --> 00:19.410
I'm gonna go here.

00:19.590 --> 00:22.220
Within the content that's going to be displayed on a page.

00:22.220 --> 00:26.130
So within the adding text and I'm going to say hello people.

00:26.130 --> 00:27.900
Now again we would need to say this.

00:27.930 --> 00:31.870
And again you can prefer a shortcut or the long way through the file system.

00:32.070 --> 00:38.130
And here I'm going to say this now once I save it I need to head over back to my Web page again and

00:38.130 --> 00:42.600
refresh at the moment we refresh the page obviously we have Hello people.

00:42.600 --> 00:47.670
And while this does not seem like a lot of work right now trust me the more and more we're going to

00:47.670 --> 00:53.870
be learning and working and experiencing this is going to get annoying really fast in order to fix that.

00:53.880 --> 00:57.560
We're going to install our first extension for the Visual Studio code.

00:58.080 --> 01:04.050
So I'm gonna click on this icon and now you'd need to search for our extension now if you'd like to

01:04.050 --> 01:05.370
search for extension again.

01:05.370 --> 01:07.410
We would do this in a searchable.

01:07.590 --> 01:12.240
So here I'm just going to type alive and the name of the extension is gonna be server.

01:12.270 --> 01:15.360
Now this is gonna bring up the extension that we're looking for.

01:15.440 --> 01:20.580
And as you can see the moment I make the sidebar a little bit bigger we can just see more clear what

01:20.580 --> 01:22.640
this extension is all about.

01:22.650 --> 01:28.260
Now if you want to have more information about extension which you should probably read a lot of times

01:28.530 --> 01:30.170
before you install this extension.

01:30.180 --> 01:31.860
So that is a good option.

01:31.860 --> 01:36.780
You can just click on it or double click on it and then you're going to have this info window.

01:36.780 --> 01:42.310
Now if you'd like to install the extension once again click on the installing of the extension.

01:42.450 --> 01:45.390
And now we would need to reload the Visual Studio code.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.600
So it is gonna click on reloading and sure enough.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.880
Now we have our extension available.

01:50.970 --> 01:51.830
How do I know that.

01:52.230 --> 01:57.870
Because these are the extensions that we have on our machine and these would be the recommended extensions

01:58.500 --> 02:03.960
as well as the moment I'm going to start typing Visual Studio code is gonna be suggesting me extensions

02:04.320 --> 02:07.380
obviously based on what we're typing here in the search.

02:08.160 --> 02:13.440
So with all that being said what I can do right now is first of all minimize it just so you can see

02:13.440 --> 02:15.160
a little bit better what's happening.

02:15.210 --> 02:19.220
I'm also gonna close whatever the web browser we had before.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.480
I'm going to close this browser thing.

02:21.480 --> 02:27.690
Then let's also maybe make this smaller as was open it up in the actual file system.

02:27.730 --> 02:31.250
My arms are not filesystem basically in the folder.

02:31.380 --> 02:37.890
And then once we have all that what we would need to do is right now navigate to our workspace and once

02:37.890 --> 02:40.860
we are in our workspace again we have few options.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.570
So either we can go here where we have go live.

02:44.610 --> 02:50.670
So this is gonna open up the life server or we can right click it and again we're gonna have the option

02:50.670 --> 02:57.780
of open with a life server as well as we have a shortcut on the shortcut would be commando and commando.

02:58.250 --> 03:04.630
Now I'm just gonna press the go live over here and this is gonna open up our local development sir.

03:04.680 --> 03:09.930
Now what's really nice about this why we would prefer this way instead of the previous one.

03:10.110 --> 03:15.890
Well first of all the way that course is gonna be setting up is I'm gonna setup them side by side so

03:15.890 --> 03:23.070
I'm gonna open up this guy so my visual studio code as well as my code or I'm sorry my local development

03:23.070 --> 03:24.380
server on the right hand side.

03:24.870 --> 03:29.930
So all the changes that we're gonna be doing we're all gonna be able to see right away in our life server.

03:30.390 --> 03:34.590
So let's say that I'm first of all gonna close this because it's complaining that we don't have a proper

03:34.590 --> 03:37.320
structure which we will gonna do in the next three years.

03:37.320 --> 03:42.810
And don't worry about it but let's say if I would like to change this back to the helo people I can

03:42.810 --> 03:47.040
just delete whatever I would like to change and we're gonna write Hello world.

03:47.220 --> 03:53.600
Now for now nothing's gonna change because we still don't have the proper syntax for the HDMI document.

03:53.610 --> 03:55.640
So basically there has to be structure.

03:55.830 --> 04:00.960
However later on we're gonna have an option where every time we're gonna be making some kind of change

04:01.410 --> 04:07.320
the changes are gonna be showing up right away alive here on the right hand side in our local development

04:07.320 --> 04:07.680
server.

04:08.220 --> 04:11.600
And trust me in a long run that makes our lives much more easier.
