00:00.390 --> 00:01.020
Excellent.

00:01.020 --> 00:06.870
Now that we know the syntax why don't we start with our first most basic selector.

00:06.870 --> 00:08.950
Which is gonna be the type selector.

00:09.030 --> 00:13.450
Now in order to work properly let me just delete everything that I have in a see assess.

00:13.470 --> 00:19.320
Now you don't have to do this but in my opinion I would like to start from scratch is that way you don't

00:19.320 --> 00:22.470
get confused with the previous code essentially AML.

00:22.500 --> 00:28.610
I'm gonna create a new element so there's gonna be one having one with hello world then heading to.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.680
Now let's add maybe a paragraph.

00:30.810 --> 00:36.750
Now please understand that we can add all the HCM elements we would like but in my case I'm just gonna

00:36.750 --> 00:40.050
add three of them because it's gonna work exactly the same.

00:40.050 --> 00:44.780
So there's gonna be a heading one heading to paragraph with 50 words.

00:44.850 --> 00:45.350
Okay.

00:45.600 --> 00:46.350
So far so good.

00:46.920 --> 00:52.120
Then I'm gonna head over to styles assess and make my first selection.

00:52.320 --> 00:57.600
Now whenever we're gonna be working with selectors the most basic selector is gonna be the type select

00:58.410 --> 01:03.270
now type selector reflect of the type of email element you'd like to select.

01:03.960 --> 01:09.120
So if you want to select having one you're gonna type hearing one you're going to want to select having

01:09.120 --> 01:11.940
two you're gonna type heading to.

01:12.450 --> 01:17.250
Now what do you think you're gonna have to type if you want to select paragraph.

01:17.300 --> 01:22.890
I think you probably answered b meaning for paragraph so that would be correct.

01:22.910 --> 01:27.790
Now in order to work with that we already know we would need to create a selector.

01:28.010 --> 01:34.790
In my case let's say having one and now like to say what kind of styles I would want to add or this

01:34.970 --> 01:40.880
element now in my case I'm gonna write colour again and we're gonna use color quite excessively in the

01:40.880 --> 01:44.390
beginning because that's just easier one to show you.

01:44.410 --> 01:49.070
Because you can right away see it on the browser and let's say again we're going to start very simply

01:49.070 --> 01:51.770
by having one is going to be read.

01:51.770 --> 01:57.940
So sure enough all the heading ones or in our case is just one that we have in our document.

01:58.070 --> 02:03.190
Are we gonna have the colour right now the same is gonna work if I'm gonna have the heading to.

02:03.250 --> 02:06.800
And again I'm just selecting this as my selector.

02:06.800 --> 02:13.850
So all the elements on my page that are gonna be heading to I'm gonna have colour and let's say green

02:14.090 --> 02:18.790
again nothing really earth shattering but we know that this is working.

02:18.980 --> 02:25.510
And last but not least we have the paragraph and again exactly the same way of whatever age the male

02:25.520 --> 02:32.420
element you have in my case I have a paragraph and let's say colour is gonna be great.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.830
So so far so good.

02:34.940 --> 02:41.870
Every time we would like to style some kind of HDMI element the easiest and the most basic selector

02:41.870 --> 02:48.440
would be type selector where we just select the type of the H M element we would like to style.
