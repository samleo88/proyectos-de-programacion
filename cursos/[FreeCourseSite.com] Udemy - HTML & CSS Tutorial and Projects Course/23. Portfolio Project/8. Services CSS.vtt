WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:06.570
Now once we're done with NHT I'm now let's go to the main thesis and let's actually styling this section.

00:06.620 --> 00:10.120
So here you can see that this would be the end of about section.

00:10.320 --> 00:13.850
Then we're going to create two comments of section title.

00:13.860 --> 00:18.750
So this is going to be the general title that we're working on here that said this is going to be the

00:18.750 --> 00:27.630
end of section title and then also let's create a services social services services section and are

00:27.660 --> 00:31.970
here let's do the same thing and say that this is going to be end of services section.

00:32.010 --> 00:37.850
Now we're here for the About section what we would want well or here for the section title.

00:37.980 --> 00:41.570
The first one would be like I said a generic one.

00:41.610 --> 00:45.640
So here we're going to say section that also and this was the class.

00:45.880 --> 00:53.630
So here we're going to say just text on line center or so now the text is the center and then it's actually.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.440
The section title name.

00:55.560 --> 00:59.430
So section on your title.

00:59.890 --> 01:03.150
And for the title What is title name.

01:03.250 --> 01:07.540
So to underscore his name now let's do font size.

01:07.540 --> 01:12.850
First of all font size and let's say that this is going to be for all Reems.

01:12.940 --> 01:15.750
So this is going to be the actual size of the title.

01:15.950 --> 01:24.820
Then we'll have a letter spacing 0.5 RPM over here and let's do a background like this.

01:24.880 --> 01:28.710
And for the background we're going to do the same thing we did with an About section.

01:28.930 --> 01:33.750
So first of all going to find where the image folder and then we're going to have a title BCG.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.930
So this is going to be our background then we're going to say on here that the background should be

01:37.930 --> 01:39.450
in the center or here.

01:39.620 --> 01:41.680
So we're going to actually save it.

01:41.710 --> 01:43.620
We're going to say again no repeat.

01:43.680 --> 01:48.900
So here you can see that now our background is going to be there and it's going to be Norby.

01:49.040 --> 01:57.100
After that we will have a text transform of capsulize text transform and capitalize.

01:57.280 --> 02:03.490
And after that we're going to have a font weight here of 700.

02:03.570 --> 02:05.780
And this is going to say 700.

02:06.040 --> 02:15.630
And then after that we're going to have font style it out so font style is going to be like this.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.970
So now we have Italian fonts.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.790
Now once we're actually DONE WITH A sections I.

02:22.090 --> 02:24.960
Let's do a services section.

02:25.300 --> 02:28.030
And for the first services section.

02:28.110 --> 02:30.530
So we're going to have a services.

02:30.590 --> 02:38.710
This was our actual class and let's do a background for the background was devoir here was do Section

02:38.710 --> 02:39.430
3.

02:39.490 --> 02:39.850
All right.

02:39.850 --> 02:42.250
So this is going to be our dark section.

02:42.250 --> 02:47.080
So this is why we're using the variable because later on you can actually change the color to whatever

02:47.080 --> 02:48.190
you want.

02:48.640 --> 02:53.540
And after that would is a pattern three hour exams and zero.

02:53.730 --> 02:57.930
So we're going to be padding top bottom here and left and right.

02:58.210 --> 03:03.880
And the reason left and right is zero because over here we're going to say services on here and center

03:04.350 --> 03:08.920
and for the center now we're going to do again the max with we're here in this case.

03:08.920 --> 03:12.610
This is going to be 90 view with us or here.

03:12.610 --> 03:14.620
So this is going to be always like this.

03:14.620 --> 03:21.610
And then we're going to say well you're also margin two RPMs and Arto or so and so I say you can see

03:21.610 --> 03:22.000
that.

03:22.240 --> 03:28.970
Now I have two RPMs bottom but on here this is going to be always in the center with 90 you.

03:29.200 --> 03:34.940
So once we have the actual services center let's do a single service.

03:34.960 --> 03:38.460
So this is the actual article that's holding all the items.

03:38.470 --> 03:39.040
All right.

03:39.250 --> 03:45.860
So here we're going to see services then this is going to be a single service.

03:45.910 --> 03:48.720
So this is going to be the whole article that's holding.

03:48.950 --> 03:57.070
You know we're going to do again Marjan to our CMS are no here they're all going to do a text align

03:57.710 --> 04:03.580
center then we're going to have a transition because like I said before we're we're going to have is

04:03.670 --> 04:08.080
as I'm hovering You can see that we have this box there's white background.

04:08.250 --> 04:11.250
However again I want this change to happen over time.

04:11.320 --> 04:16.620
So we're going to do the same thing we're going to say transition for transition is going to be all

04:16.760 --> 04:22.240
of the whole transitions whatever transitions we're doing for whatever properties we're changing the

04:22.240 --> 04:23.090
values.

04:23.290 --> 04:25.160
Let's do 0.5 seconds.

04:25.330 --> 04:27.310
And again you know what let's do.

04:27.490 --> 04:31.830
And as you can see or here we have ease ease in in and out ease out.

04:31.830 --> 04:35.420
So again this would be the way the actual transition is taking place.

04:35.440 --> 04:39.860
So I'd say here is it is going to be the case once I have this.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.470
Let's also do a patent.

04:41.650 --> 04:48.550
And for the parting words do again maybe it was due to our Reems an hour here we're going to say zero.

04:48.820 --> 04:54.200
So we don't want any padding on the left and right on top and bottom.

04:54.550 --> 05:01.870
So once we have the actual single service meds do a services single service and do hover.

05:02.060 --> 05:07.960
So as we hovering what should happen Well first what we're going to say here is the background is going

05:07.960 --> 05:08.900
to be light.

05:08.970 --> 05:12.000
So I'm going to say voire And here we're going to use the light.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.330
So this is going to be a light back.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.650
So as I'm hovering You can see what happens.

05:16.810 --> 05:19.150
You can see that the background is becoming light.

05:19.270 --> 05:25.240
Now I also I would want a little bit of back shadow So here we're going to see box Shanno and then we're

05:25.240 --> 05:27.630
going to have up for first value is going to be zero.

05:27.970 --> 05:32.910
Then for the second we're going to say 15 pixels 20 pixels is going to be for the blur.

05:33.020 --> 05:34.840
And now we do want a color.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.550
So for the color let's do the black one.

05:37.740 --> 05:42.230
Zero zero zero zero point 1.

05:42.250 --> 05:49.000
So we're like this ones we're going to go back or here you can see that now I have my back shadow like

05:49.000 --> 05:49.450
this.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.230
So this is going to be my box.

05:51.370 --> 05:52.340
I created.

05:52.810 --> 05:58.500
Once we have our box shadow shadowing the next one is going to be so single service icon we're we're

05:58.500 --> 06:04.980
going to say and services then we're going to have 200 course single year service and then we're going

06:04.980 --> 06:05.780
to say I.

06:05.940 --> 06:11.640
So this is going to be the icon we're actually working on now what we would want all here is a real

06:11.640 --> 06:13.330
font size.

06:13.370 --> 06:16.810
And let's do three Reems or here.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.960
So this is going to be our big icon.

06:20.040 --> 06:25.950
And once we had the font size for the icon of three R.E.M. you can see that there's some kind of mistake

06:25.950 --> 06:30.300
or because you can see that I have or hear this with the big letters.

06:30.300 --> 06:35.460
So let me go back over here and if I'm going to find or hear this creativity you can see that it has

06:35.460 --> 06:41.790
stayed out here within the div so I need in this case just moved outside and live and then everything

06:41.790 --> 06:43.350
is going to be working correctly.

06:43.380 --> 06:47.420
So let's go back to the main see assess and keep on styling.

06:47.490 --> 06:54.180
Now once we're done with an icon next one is going to be service style and this is going to be services

06:54.390 --> 06:57.710
more here than we're going to have a single service.

06:57.840 --> 07:01.130
And then instead of going on here we're going to write right.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.430
So this is what we're going to be styling right now.

07:03.720 --> 07:07.980
And for the title we're going to say text or hair transform.

07:08.020 --> 07:10.000
And this is going to be uppercase.

07:10.110 --> 07:18.990
Now once we have it uppercase then again let's do font weight and let's do it in 700 here like this.

07:18.990 --> 07:22.430
Now once we say it next one is going to be margin.

07:22.590 --> 07:28.860
And when I say we're here in margin top and for the margin double We're going to do one Reems here.

07:29.030 --> 07:33.970
So this is going to be margined up and then we're also want margin Marham.

07:34.110 --> 07:40.720
So that's right on your margin bottom and for the margin bottom and we're also going into one area.

07:40.980 --> 07:48.700
So top bottom is going to be are you going let's do better spacing which is going to be an OK 0.2 rpms

07:48.780 --> 07:49.980
or hit or miss.

07:49.980 --> 07:55.050
So this is going to be the spacing we're actually doing now and the last thing is going to be actually

07:55.110 --> 07:56.690
service next.

07:56.730 --> 08:04.980
So let's say here services and services single service and again instead of I can say over here text.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.310
So this is what class will be.

08:07.440 --> 08:12.300
And here we're going to write with 80 percent on it like this.

08:12.300 --> 08:19.920
So now you can see that my actual paragraph is going to be 80 percent or you could see that it's aligning

08:19.920 --> 08:20.830
all the way.

08:21.170 --> 08:26.240
So what I would want is margin 0 Otto or like this.

08:26.300 --> 08:31.210
What I also want to do is let's say that on a text online I'm going to say left.

08:31.470 --> 08:33.810
So I'm going to say text a line and left.

08:33.810 --> 08:36.460
So lexically what I'm going to do is I'm going to overwrite.

08:36.540 --> 08:41.480
So if this guy was everything was in the center what I would want just for the sake of it just place

08:41.490 --> 08:43.790
it all the way over here and left.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.650
And also as do a line height.

08:46.910 --> 08:48.700
So it's a real line.

08:48.740 --> 08:49.350
All right.

08:49.350 --> 08:57.300
And let's say one point five and then after that letter spacing and 0.2 RPMs are like this.

08:57.540 --> 09:00.570
So this is our actual text would look like.

09:00.810 --> 09:06.870
And now what's left to do is actually go ahead and work with a different screen set because obviously

09:06.870 --> 09:10.330
we're now again the same as how we had with an About section.

09:10.440 --> 09:13.940
Everything looks like this doesn't matter on the screen it says.

09:14.190 --> 09:19.970
So what we would want is use the flex box to actually place them side by side.

09:20.040 --> 09:25.650
So let's say we're here again this is going to be the services section and may create some more room

09:26.070 --> 09:31.610
here and let's write some more rules or so the first one is going to be a media.

09:31.710 --> 09:37.740
So we're going to have media screen and you can see that it's interesting the wrong thing on your screen

09:38.240 --> 09:38.820
here.

09:39.050 --> 09:46.020
And we're going to say and mean what happened with and what we would want for the mean with is going

09:46.020 --> 09:48.240
to be 760 pixels.

09:48.330 --> 09:52.040
So this is going to be the actual screen where you want to start with.

09:52.440 --> 09:58.860
And here again we're going to use a service center which is a parent right now for all of them and we're

09:58.860 --> 10:02.910
going to say we're here to display flex like this.

10:02.910 --> 10:07.570
So once we reach 768 this is going to be on display.

10:07.890 --> 10:11.210
Now let's go ahead and let's actually see how it's going to look like.

10:11.220 --> 10:12.880
So this is going to be our portfolio.

10:13.060 --> 10:14.220
And so we're fresh.

10:14.270 --> 10:17.150
And I can see that all of them are lined up or here like this.

10:17.170 --> 10:18.880
Now this is not what one.

10:19.020 --> 10:21.230
So we're going to first say we're here like this.

10:21.390 --> 10:23.720
First we're going to say that we would want it to wrap.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.460
So Flex rap rap.

10:26.610 --> 10:29.270
So if it needs to rap it has to rap.

10:29.460 --> 10:34.290
And also we're going to say right away just the fact connoted animals do space between.

10:34.410 --> 10:39.630
Because again we're going to be creating our own paddings and margins in between.

10:39.720 --> 10:44.130
So we would want them to actually be placed as far away from each other.

10:44.250 --> 10:48.780
So here since we have the parent and we applied already rules.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.300
Now what was our single service.

10:51.300 --> 10:52.570
So this was our child.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.010
So we had services single service.

10:56.180 --> 10:57.620
So this was our job.

10:57.980 --> 11:03.230
All of them what I'm going to say is the same thing when I say here flex that I'm going to say zero.

11:03.260 --> 11:06.120
So don't grow don't shrink.

11:06.140 --> 11:07.900
No here we're going to say calc.

11:07.910 --> 11:14.880
And for the calculational to say 50 percent minus again you know here we're going to use 0.5 our eems

11:15.300 --> 11:16.360
on this.

11:16.610 --> 11:21.600
Once I say read and if I'm going to go back over here and if you're going to refresh you can see that

11:21.600 --> 11:27.760
this is how it's going to look like starting from or here 760 pixels.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.170
Now there are going to be a lineup like this.

11:30.170 --> 11:34.960
And since there is six elements on here like this obviously there's going to be two apiece.

11:35.150 --> 11:40.850
However if I'm going to go to smaller screen once I reach the smaller screen rerolling this is going

11:40.850 --> 11:42.350
to be the single item.

11:42.620 --> 11:47.280
Now obviously I also want for the bigger screen actually change around the globe.

11:47.450 --> 11:52.280
So once I reach nine and to actually one single service to be a little bit different.

11:52.320 --> 12:00.680
So here we're going to say media and we're going to say screen and all here and I mean again with some

12:00.680 --> 12:05.580
men with what we would want for the men with.

12:05.710 --> 12:14.690
So for men with 9 9 2 or hit pixels out once again services single service because what we need to understand

12:14.690 --> 12:22.190
is that we already have the display flex flex wrap just if I counted starting from 760.

12:22.190 --> 12:27.560
So this is not going to change what I would want to change or here's this guy because I would want it

12:27.560 --> 12:34.560
for 768 to have one labeled and then one once I reach nine and do one this late.

12:34.730 --> 12:41.450
So all I have to do is actually going to copy and paste this and or rewrite copy then I'm going to paste

12:41.450 --> 12:43.570
this and I'm going to change the values around.

12:43.820 --> 12:49.720
So instead of 50 percent I'm going right over here thirty three point three three three or like this.

12:49.870 --> 12:56.060
Well let's actually make or here also this padding or this margin between them but smaller.

12:56.270 --> 13:00.030
So I'd say 0.25 more like this.

13:00.050 --> 13:01.500
So let's go back over here.

13:01.850 --> 13:07.700
And once I fresh you can see that first I have my single or your service.

13:07.790 --> 13:09.640
Then once I break the bigger screen.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.310
Now there's two of them side by side.

13:12.470 --> 13:15.730
One is I'm going to reach nine and two I was actually going to be three.

13:16.040 --> 13:24.350
So this is how we can make actual use of using the flex box and aligning the actual flex box children

13:24.560 --> 13:26.650
according to the actual screen size.
