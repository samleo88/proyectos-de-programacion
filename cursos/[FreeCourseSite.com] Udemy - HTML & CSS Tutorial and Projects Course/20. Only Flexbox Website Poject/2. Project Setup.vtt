WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:06.720
Now that we're ready to start working on our project we would need to do our basic set up because all

00:06.720 --> 00:10.630
our projects Herger ago cowriter pretty much the same things right.

00:10.740 --> 00:14.310
Even though for different projects they would be actually customized.

00:14.760 --> 00:19.470
So all our projects we're going to need to find some icons and we're going to need to pick some kind

00:19.470 --> 00:26.250
of fund that our hero when we need pick some images or he'll going to pick some colors.

00:26.310 --> 00:31.870
So let's go ahead and let's start working on our basic setup so you can see or hear it.

00:32.220 --> 00:38.700
I have a folder like Project and it's completely empty or it's sitting on my desktop and I'm using a

00:38.700 --> 00:39.930
bracket's texter.

00:40.140 --> 00:46.200
So I'm going to do or I'm just going to drag this folder on here like this like drag it all the way

00:46.200 --> 00:51.870
to my text for once it's in there what I'm going to do first I'm going to create a new file and I'm

00:51.870 --> 00:54.040
going to say this is going to be the next page.

00:54.500 --> 00:59.670
And for here we're going to make right away a live preview so we can actually start working side by

00:59.670 --> 01:00.260
side.

01:00.660 --> 01:06.350
So this is going to be my real life preview and that I'm going to make it a full screen here like this.

01:06.360 --> 01:06.990
Right.

01:07.020 --> 01:11.950
And then the first thing that will do we're going to add hd a mascot.

01:11.970 --> 01:17.430
So here I'm just going to say this is going to be full HD all sculpt and home like this.

01:17.430 --> 01:22.890
The language you're going to have is going to be English then or here the style sheet right.

01:22.950 --> 01:25.790
Is going to be linked to our style sheet that's out here.

01:25.880 --> 01:30.630
And this is going to be project rent and this is going to be the name of our file.

01:30.710 --> 01:31.760
We're here link.

01:31.790 --> 01:33.820
This is going to be our main success.

01:33.870 --> 01:35.720
I'm going to leave a comment.

01:35.800 --> 01:39.550
Main see it says that on here you can see this is going to be doing.

01:39.570 --> 01:42.540
And here we're going to say also main CIRCE's.

01:42.600 --> 01:49.010
Right now we would need to create a space as file to send you file maned see this.

01:49.110 --> 01:52.270
Now that we have this we're going to leave this one for now.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.650
And we're going to go back to the next page tomorrow.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.140
And this is going to be script.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.870
This is going to be for javascript.

01:57.890 --> 02:04.120
We're all going out once in a while some type of javascript in order to make our website function.

02:04.140 --> 02:06.160
So now that we have this set up.

02:06.300 --> 02:09.050
First things first let's get our fantastic.

02:09.280 --> 02:13.980
So going to we're going to save this one over here and we're going to go back over here and you can

02:13.980 --> 02:20.270
see that if we go to a farm or some IO well here or you can just go back to Google you can see that

02:20.320 --> 02:27.570
if I'm right the font or some or some icons like this you can see that this is going to be the first

02:27.570 --> 02:29.160
link that's going to open up.

02:29.310 --> 02:34.220
So we bravely open up the link and we right away head for a down.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.180
All right.

02:35.190 --> 02:39.350
So here at home you can see that it's down.

02:39.660 --> 02:44.010
So it's going to say we're here and we're going to say that we would want to download.

02:44.070 --> 02:44.590
Right.

02:44.610 --> 02:49.000
You can say over here you don't need to agree all this right with all new messages.

02:49.110 --> 02:55.560
You can just say no phone number four and or hear what is going to happen is this going to say show

02:55.560 --> 02:57.980
in Finder and this is going to be our downloads.

02:58.020 --> 03:04.200
So once we open up our zip file or here right you can see the zip file opens and now what we need to

03:04.200 --> 03:06.360
do is drag it or fold.

03:06.810 --> 03:09.240
So here are just going to minimize this.

03:09.350 --> 03:16.110
Here find the folder project and on here with we're going to do is going to drag this one and actually

03:16.110 --> 03:17.560
place it in a project.

03:17.560 --> 03:22.400
So now when it's sitting in our project Let's go ahead and actually add a fantastic.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.310
So here you can see that this is going to be my farm Tarsem.

03:25.470 --> 03:29.850
So here and there the main thing is this what we're going to do is we're going to say this is going

03:29.850 --> 03:30.510
to be common.

03:30.520 --> 03:36.150
This is going to be Fonte awesome icons here like this.

03:36.210 --> 03:40.520
So let's create a link here with a Amut.

03:40.620 --> 03:43.160
So here I'm going to say this is going to be Fonte right.

03:43.220 --> 03:47.170
So now I need to actually show where's my folder awesome.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.960
Then we're going to go to see assess.

03:49.050 --> 03:51.170
And we're going to go to phantasm.

03:51.270 --> 03:51.960
Yes.

03:52.110 --> 03:54.920
And all here just to test that out and everything is working.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.960
We're going to do a very basic one.

03:57.030 --> 04:01.900
We're going to say this is going to be high with a class of hey here.

04:01.990 --> 04:05.400
Hey And let's say this is going to be home when you're like this.

04:05.400 --> 04:11.910
And now I can see that I have the home and I was the side note for typing my age the e-mail I'm going

04:11.910 --> 04:18.960
to be using and met bracket's extension or here let me show you where it is basically or here it is

04:19.050 --> 04:20.340
already downloaded.

04:20.380 --> 04:24.340
Right so now you can see the fish sitting in a bracket extensions.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.890
And it just takes a little bit of time to actually see right.

04:28.140 --> 04:34.080
And within that if we go down here right this is going to be high speed HD Malins see this workflow.

04:34.320 --> 04:38.190
And basically what it means is that this is going to speed up our workflow.

04:38.370 --> 04:42.050
We don't need to type all the time the full element right.

04:42.090 --> 04:48.870
The force and or development we can just type few things and it's basically going to do the out of feel

04:48.870 --> 04:49.500
for us.

04:49.620 --> 04:52.560
But obviously at the end you're still going to be able to see what you're writing.

04:52.560 --> 05:00.070
So even if I'm even if you are not using them right you'll see what's actually being typed.

05:00.100 --> 05:06.760
I would suggest for you to switch it because it is really going to speed up your workflow and avoid

05:06.850 --> 05:10.390
unnecessary typing class and IDs and all those kind of things.

05:10.390 --> 05:10.960
Right.

05:11.020 --> 05:16.240
So what I'm going to do here I'm going to say this now we have found us when we see or hear and next

05:16.240 --> 05:18.870
we're going to move one and look at what is the next thing.

05:19.090 --> 05:20.300
So now we're done with fun.

05:20.300 --> 05:20.670
Awesome.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.480
Next what would be Google fonts.

05:22.560 --> 05:29.740
And again we just go here and type Google fonts and we are led all here to this page and on here I'm

05:29.740 --> 05:34.960
going to download right away rebottle because I like them and they're popular and all kinds of good

05:34.960 --> 05:35.670
stuff.

05:35.680 --> 05:41.130
However obviously you can see or hear that you have choices upon choices of choice.

05:41.180 --> 05:41.880
Right.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.150
And on here you can be more specific right.

05:44.170 --> 05:50.510
You can click whatever class you want right so you can choose the categories or you have styles right.

05:50.510 --> 05:55.260
Or you can choose the thickness and slant and I mean I going to go over these options because they're

05:55.270 --> 06:00.580
very self-explanatory what you can do however how you download this right.

06:00.610 --> 06:05.220
So what you can do here was going out here and you can see that it's a family select.

06:05.230 --> 06:10.570
So what we do here you can see that it opens up and then it says all right to this is we wouldn't be

06:10.570 --> 06:11.950
doing that we would need.

06:12.100 --> 06:17.770
And this is the link that we need to place actually in our head element and our hand is when we would

06:17.770 --> 06:18.620
need to add.

06:18.640 --> 06:19.020
Right.

06:19.060 --> 06:22.130
And obviously this we would have tactual body.

06:22.180 --> 06:23.740
So what you going to do here.

06:23.830 --> 06:26.330
We're going to say that this is going to be phantasm.

06:26.470 --> 06:32.250
And after that or here we're going to say this is going to be Google and we're going to say for months.

06:32.260 --> 06:32.800
Right.

06:32.880 --> 06:38.470
So here what is going to happen when the copy and paste this writing this is going to be new fonts will

06:38.470 --> 06:41.030
save this and we're going to go back over here.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.400
I don't know what to say for the whole body.

06:43.420 --> 06:49.390
We're going to go back and we're going to get this from the family room Otto So here I'm going to copy

06:49.390 --> 06:55.690
this and we're going to go back over here and and copy paste this font family everybody.

06:55.810 --> 07:03.220
So now when we have our custom fonts Let's check it out where we could get a images and where we can

07:03.220 --> 07:04.660
get colors and clothes.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.100
This from Tarsem.

07:06.370 --> 07:09.820
And obviously you can get images from Google if you want.

07:09.820 --> 07:14.430
However there's always going to be an issue if you're actually trying to sell something right.

07:14.500 --> 07:19.420
Has your web page or something like that that you obviously need to have a copyright.

07:19.470 --> 07:20.030
Right.

07:20.350 --> 07:26.310
You cannot just willy nilly starting other people's images because they obviously belong to them.

07:26.380 --> 07:28.800
So you can always do is go to pixels.

07:28.920 --> 07:33.640
That's one of the Web sites and there's obviously few of them right where you can actually get images

07:33.640 --> 07:38.110
for free more here and they're very actually good quality.

07:38.290 --> 07:41.500
All right so we've got the pixels you can see what's happening right.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.410
You can see that these are going to be images.

07:43.430 --> 07:46.360
But obviously here you can just search right.

07:46.360 --> 07:50.320
So I'm kind of right on your computer doing this right.

07:50.320 --> 07:55.700
And I was going to have computer images on here if I'm going to type on City.

07:55.880 --> 08:00.770
Right and we're going to be getting a lot of my city images and I can go on and on.

08:00.790 --> 08:01.750
Right.

08:01.810 --> 08:05.100
So this would be a very nice site to actually get images.

08:05.110 --> 08:09.910
And actually once you start getting images from here and once you're going to be surfing around the

08:09.910 --> 08:15.870
web you actually are going to notice that a lot of even well-known Web sites use this as free images

08:15.880 --> 08:16.270
right.

08:16.270 --> 08:21.210
It might come as a surprise but you're actually very soon to notice a lot of people are using these

08:21.210 --> 08:22.080
sites.

08:22.090 --> 08:27.660
So here the next one would be Gratus the graphy just because it gives you a lot of funky images.

08:27.850 --> 08:32.980
So if you have like some type of I don't know section of your web site or the whole project you want

08:32.980 --> 08:34.390
to make it funky right.

08:34.450 --> 08:39.840
Go to grad discover it because you can really get some some really cool and interesting images.

08:39.880 --> 08:45.950
Then after that we have afterimages we have colors so I'm going to call these guys here.

08:46.240 --> 08:52.540
And for the colors I would suggest over here this see and over here this is going to be two O's and

08:52.540 --> 08:53.540
then colors right.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.810
So cool person or something like that right.

08:56.050 --> 09:02.020
And or a nice thing oh here is the generator to go back over here and we click on generator.

09:02.230 --> 09:07.420
And now what we would need to do is actually just start pressing the space bar and we're going to be

09:07.420 --> 09:08.750
giving five options.

09:08.780 --> 09:13.870
It's all anti-fracking repressing spreadable you can see that my colors are changing.

09:13.960 --> 09:17.270
However I can go back over here and let's say you can see this lock.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.200
So you can lock this car and now I'm getting for.

09:20.320 --> 09:20.840
Right.

09:20.890 --> 09:23.090
So now if I pick again something right.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.310
So now I'm going to be having over here.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.090
Then let's say I'm going to pick.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.160
I don't know.

09:28.490 --> 09:29.350
And the collar on.

09:29.350 --> 09:30.290
Right right.

09:30.310 --> 09:31.720
So now we have all of them right.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.810
So let's say I would just need last one.

09:33.910 --> 09:38.800
So I'm just going to keep on pressing all here wherever and till I find whatever color I want.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.610
Now obviously you don't need to use all five of them right.

09:41.750 --> 09:45.590
But what it does it actually has a good suggestions right.

09:45.670 --> 09:52.720
Which colors would actually go together and now that we're actually done with our basic setup we can

09:52.720 --> 09:55.270
go ahead and start working on our project.
