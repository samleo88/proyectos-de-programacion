00:00.120 --> 00:00.840
Hi guys.

00:00.840 --> 00:05.100
In this video I would like to talk about keyboard shortcut now.

00:05.160 --> 00:12.990
In general the main idea is to save you time of not using the mouse because the more more web development

00:12.990 --> 00:16.580
with HDMI hours is so javascript you're going to do.

00:16.740 --> 00:22.140
You'll notice that instead of reaching for the mouse each and every time you need to do something.

00:22.200 --> 00:27.420
If you're going to use a keyboard that we're going to save you a lot of time in along.

00:27.420 --> 00:33.030
Now I have to warn you right off the bat that in the beginning they might seem like a hassle so you

00:33.030 --> 00:35.640
might be like well this does not make sense.

00:35.640 --> 00:41.120
I can just use the mouse and you can but I would suggest incorporating them one by one.

00:41.220 --> 00:44.770
Let's say I learned one of them and then every time you needed to start using it.

00:44.940 --> 00:52.140
And then eventually pick it up more and more and you'll see how your workflow is going to improve dramatically.

00:52.140 --> 00:54.870
Now first and foremost where we can get all of them.

00:54.900 --> 01:00.440
So if you'd like to know all your keyboard shortcuts in a visual studio called where you can find them.

01:00.480 --> 01:04.550
Well you need to open the Visual Studio code in new time.

01:04.560 --> 01:10.620
Then we're gonna get the welcome screen and notice here we have principal keyboard teacher.

01:11.070 --> 01:14.680
And this is where we're looking for a keyboard shortcut.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.040
Now what's going to happen the moment you open open up.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.090
These are gonna be your shortcuts.

01:19.170 --> 01:22.170
Now nobody's expecting you to remember all of them.

01:22.210 --> 01:28.410
Obviously it's impossible especially like first day and I wouldn't suggest memorizing them from for

01:28.440 --> 01:29.730
some kind of reason.

01:29.730 --> 01:34.640
Instead I like I said I would suggest incorporating the most interesting ones.

01:34.710 --> 01:38.010
And then one by one pick it up more and more.

01:38.130 --> 01:44.220
Now what I'm gonna show you is just a few of the ones that I'm using may be the ones that I kind of

01:44.220 --> 01:44.710
feel.

01:44.820 --> 01:47.450
Most important ones I don't know it's really up to you.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.650
You will see again.

01:48.660 --> 01:49.940
You want to use them.

01:50.070 --> 01:50.740
Great.

01:50.760 --> 01:51.850
You don't want to use them.

01:51.870 --> 01:52.940
It's also fine.

01:53.010 --> 01:54.320
It's really up to you.

01:54.600 --> 02:01.230
Now whenever I'm gonna be talking about the option key I also can mentioned that this probably would

02:01.230 --> 02:01.940
be all.

02:02.190 --> 02:08.550
I'm pretty sure because as I'm looking right now at my mac keyboard it says option but I'm quite certain

02:08.550 --> 02:10.890
that it would also me not.

02:11.070 --> 02:18.300
And also I'd like to mention that whenever I'm gonna say command in most cases on the windows this is

02:18.300 --> 02:19.450
gonna mean control.

02:19.620 --> 02:26.160
Again I cannot guarantee either but in most cases I'm quite certain that this is gonna be the case.

02:26.160 --> 02:32.250
Now let's start with the most basic one which in fact probably has nothing to do with Visual Studio

02:32.250 --> 02:38.550
code but you can still use it here and that is command Zi which is for undoing stuff.

02:39.390 --> 02:44.760
So let's say I'm going to write something someone said there's gonna be a hearing One and heading one

02:44.760 --> 02:47.280
is going to be the world.

02:47.310 --> 02:50.240
Now I'm going to copy and paste the line which we're going to learn later.

02:50.520 --> 02:51.300
And you know what.

02:51.300 --> 02:56.530
At some point I'm going to decide that I don't need this line so I'm gonna delete this line.

02:56.550 --> 03:00.920
Now what would happen if I would change my mind again and if I would want to get a line.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.840
No actually I can create a new one.

03:03.060 --> 03:06.620
But the fastest way option would be pressing commands.

03:07.080 --> 03:11.240
And it pretty much undo is everything that I did last.

03:11.250 --> 03:18.770
Now again we also have an options of command C for copying and command plus V or pacing.

03:18.950 --> 03:21.170
So also those would be the basic ones.

03:21.270 --> 03:26.520
And if you want to check some commands let's say for editing as you can see you have the undo and the

03:26.520 --> 03:32.600
shortcut would be command Z and we have redo again that would be shift command plus the.

03:32.730 --> 03:35.370
And then I have copy cut copy and paste.

03:35.790 --> 03:37.640
So again those would be very basic ones.

03:38.250 --> 03:44.190
However even though they seem basic trust me Andrew is gonna save you a lot of times whenever you make

03:44.190 --> 03:45.750
some kind of mess.

03:45.750 --> 03:50.090
Now very interesting one would be creating multiple cursors.

03:50.400 --> 03:57.210
So let's say that I have some kind of I don't know text and let me copy and paste more lines and if

03:57.210 --> 04:03.420
I would decide that you know what not only I want to change hello world help people on one line but

04:03.420 --> 04:05.520
let's say in all six of them here.

04:05.820 --> 04:10.890
Now what we can do is we can hold the option key or hold.

04:11.170 --> 04:16.330
And then as we're holding it then start pressing on the different lines.

04:16.330 --> 04:19.370
So notice I would like to place the cursor cursor here.

04:19.460 --> 04:24.980
I'd like to place a cursor here as well as I would like to place the cursor right here.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.630
So now my cursor instead of one line is on six lines.

04:29.050 --> 04:34.940
So what I can do right now is I can just delete the world and then just type whatever I would like.

04:35.230 --> 04:40.660
As you can see this saves me a time of jumping from one line to another one and then adding hello people

04:40.660 --> 04:48.040
hello people hello people again that shortcut would be holding the option plus kick clicking whenever

04:48.040 --> 04:54.610
you like to place the cursor obviously in this case I would like to place my cursors where I have the

04:54.610 --> 04:59.980
end of the word but in general again you can place them anywhere you would like.

05:00.250 --> 05:05.340
Now also let's look at how we can select the whole line as that will be our next.

05:05.350 --> 05:09.220
So let's say if I would like to select that or not the second line.

05:09.220 --> 05:15.730
Now of course I can use the mouse and I can do something like this or has we're navigating I could just

05:15.730 --> 05:21.250
press command and plus I notice right away I have my line selected.

05:21.430 --> 05:25.620
So if I would like to delete it I can just delete the line select another one.

05:25.630 --> 05:25.940
OK.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.620
Sure enough select another one.

05:27.790 --> 05:33.340
Select the last one we just move the cursor down as well as just deleting the line.

05:33.520 --> 05:39.440
And now case we're not touching the mouse at all once we know how to select the one.

05:39.540 --> 05:44.920
We can also look at how we can navigate meaning move where the words start or end.

05:45.460 --> 05:51.130
So let's say that we are in the beginning of the line and we would like to move to the end of people.

05:51.130 --> 05:56.240
Now lastly we have an option of just moving the cursor or clicking it with the mouse.

05:56.260 --> 06:03.400
However we have also an option of holding the option key and then as we're holding the option key we

06:03.400 --> 06:06.640
can move either to the right or to the left.

06:06.650 --> 06:07.900
Notice what happens.

06:07.900 --> 06:15.430
Now I'm moving with the word not with just one move the cursor or with the actual mouse.

06:15.430 --> 06:17.550
So again this is gonna save you a lot of time.

06:17.710 --> 06:25.180
Whenever you have big line but you would like to move with the words not with actual cursors and stuff

06:25.180 --> 06:26.230
like that.

06:26.260 --> 06:31.390
Now also we have an option of right away moving from the end of the line to the beginning and going.

06:31.450 --> 06:35.120
So if I'm gonna press command and again cursor left or right.

06:35.160 --> 06:40.130
NORRIS Now moving from the one side of the line to the other side of light.

06:40.210 --> 06:43.250
Now also I can move up and down the whole document.

06:43.660 --> 06:49.110
So if I'm going to press command up as you can see right now we're on top of the document.

06:49.360 --> 06:57.940
And if I'm gonna press command and down now we're gonna be in the bottom of the document also very interesting

06:58.030 --> 07:01.920
is command and D which gets the same selection.

07:01.990 --> 07:08.560
So let's say not only we're going to have we having one as a to second having one but we're going to

07:08.560 --> 07:16.060
have let's say heading to a low world and then again let's copy and paste a line let's maybe change

07:16.060 --> 07:19.540
this to allow people people.

07:19.660 --> 07:25.180
But in this case I would like to change the ending one again back to having one.

07:25.180 --> 07:27.450
I'm sorry heading to back to having one.

07:27.730 --> 07:32.670
Now what would happen if I would like to select all the heading ones in this case.

07:32.860 --> 07:38.770
Again not the heading to it and being in the middle that has the whole world but only the heading ones.

07:38.780 --> 07:39.830
Well I have an option.

07:39.850 --> 07:46.180
As you notice as I'm hovering right now with my cursor over the heading One if I'm gonna press Amanda

07:46.660 --> 07:52.270
then I'm gonna select what I would like to start selecting and if I'm going to keep on pressing command

07:52.660 --> 07:55.440
D then I'm selecting the second one.

07:55.510 --> 08:00.150
So now I have two heading ones that I have the third one and then I have the fourth one.

08:00.750 --> 08:05.350
So in this case if I would like to change this to let's say heading for I can just change on all of

08:05.350 --> 08:06.040
them.

08:06.040 --> 08:11.620
And again this is really powerful when you have 15 of them or something like that and really gonna save

08:11.620 --> 08:12.760
you time.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.790
Now also we have an option of copying pasting the same line.

08:16.480 --> 08:22.720
Now this keyboard shortcut for that would be shift option and down key.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.750
So if I'm keyboard now.

08:25.270 --> 08:30.750
So if I'm gonna press shift option and then eyeball down check this out.

08:30.820 --> 08:37.000
So if I have a second line third one fourth one and this is basically how we can do that now we can

08:37.000 --> 08:40.420
also have an option of moving the actual line up or down.

08:41.020 --> 08:47.570
So let me just navigate to the bottom here then let's start in New Line and let's say that this is gonna

08:47.590 --> 08:54.000
be having sex so I'm Erin 6 so something like this.

08:54.010 --> 08:56.170
Well let's say that I would like to move again.

08:56.180 --> 08:58.980
They're setting six somewhere here in the middle.

08:59.130 --> 09:01.140
Let's say the third line or something like that.

09:01.680 --> 09:06.410
Now obviously we have an option we can maybe select a line we can cut it out.

09:06.420 --> 09:09.920
We can go over here and copy and paste.

09:10.170 --> 09:11.390
That is always an option.

09:11.400 --> 09:19.070
However we have a faster way we can hold the option key and then just press keyboard up or down.

09:19.110 --> 09:23.150
NORRIS Now I'm just moving this heading six up or down as much as I would want to.

09:23.550 --> 09:24.680
I want to move it out.

09:24.680 --> 09:25.520
You can move it out.

09:25.520 --> 09:26.870
You want to move it here in the comments.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.610
We can move it in the comments.

09:28.670 --> 09:31.640
This is really powerful and you will gonna use this a lot.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.610
Once you are going to start using the keyboard shortcut also we have an option of creating the comments.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.170
I think we already covered this though.

09:39.540 --> 09:44.300
Remember when I said that we can always use the command and forward slash and this is gonna create us

09:44.300 --> 09:44.800
to comment.

09:45.170 --> 09:47.630
So if you would like to write some gibberish over here.

09:47.690 --> 09:49.870
Sure enough you can go ahead and do that.

09:49.880 --> 09:54.790
Now let me select a line and let's just delete the line without a touch of the mouse.

09:54.790 --> 10:00.830
Also if you'd like to start a new line somewhere in the middle let's say that I'm navigating somewhere

10:00.830 --> 10:03.690
here and I'm at the end of the hello.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.440
However I would like to start a new line.

10:06.560 --> 10:12.020
Now one of the options would be again we can move with the command press or turn or enter and we're

10:12.020 --> 10:12.930
going to start new line.

10:13.190 --> 10:14.500
However there is a faster way.

10:14.970 --> 10:19.130
Let me do this first of all let me again navigate somewhere in the middle.

10:19.130 --> 10:22.110
And if we're gonna press command plus enter and MySQL.

10:22.130 --> 10:23.940
So you need to hold the command.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.270
Then we're gonna start right away in your line.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.680
So again we wouldn't have to navigate to the end of line.

10:29.960 --> 10:33.720
Now there is also an option of changing the shortcut.

10:33.740 --> 10:40.100
So if we're going to hold command K plus then we're gonna press first time command Okay then we're gonna

10:40.100 --> 10:47.030
press command s this is gonna open us the shortcut and we can obviously change them.

10:47.090 --> 10:53.080
So if you'd like to change how the shortcut would be entered you can obviously do it over here.

10:53.190 --> 10:57.730
And as you can see this would basically tell you what the shortcut is doing.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.370
And you can change these keys.

10:59.630 --> 11:06.680
So this would be insured about the shortcut and I would suggest at least starting one by one using them

11:07.070 --> 11:10.360
because they will gonna save you a lot of time in the long run.
