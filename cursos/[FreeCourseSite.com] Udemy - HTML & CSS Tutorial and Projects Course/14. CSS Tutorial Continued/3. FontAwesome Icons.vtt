WEBVTT

00:00.820 --> 00:05.500
As you are going to be creating more and more web projects in most cases you will going to need some

00:05.500 --> 00:06.460
kind of.

00:07.060 --> 00:08.800
The service that I really like to use.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.900
Is font awesome icon.

00:11.320 --> 00:15.510
Just a disclaimer there is many many icons you can get out there.

00:15.520 --> 00:21.700
Well the reason why I like using Phantasm because they're free they are easy to get up and running and

00:21.700 --> 00:27.150
they have a very straightforward and simple syntax as always we're going to get rid of everything that

00:27.160 --> 00:28.940
we had within the census.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.640
Then the same with an ancient e-mail.

00:31.910 --> 00:36.100
I'm just gonna say that we're looking for them let's say we're going to be looking for adding one having

00:36.100 --> 00:37.070
three.

00:37.090 --> 00:38.280
This is all gone.

00:38.320 --> 00:42.310
You know what also I'm going to clean up a little bit my head because we're all gonna be copying pasting

00:42.310 --> 00:48.130
this so I'm going to say that I'm going to copy and paste it and then I'm gonna change this not to Google

00:48.130 --> 00:48.610
fonts.

00:48.610 --> 00:53.650
We're gonna say icons or we can say font awesome doesn't really matter.

00:53.960 --> 00:55.190
We'll save it.

00:55.300 --> 00:58.060
Now we have a clean document what's next.

00:58.060 --> 01:06.070
We always go to our good old friend Google and we're gonna be looking for font some dot com and we can

01:06.070 --> 01:08.510
type font awesome icons and doesn't matter.

01:08.650 --> 01:13.890
In my case I think I'm right or we're going to have font awesome icon and this is gonna be your startup

01:13.910 --> 01:14.650
screen.

01:14.890 --> 01:18.360
Now within the star screen if you never have worked with Phantasm icons.

01:18.360 --> 01:24.550
We can go to the docs where they explain everything that you need to do and the basic use would be very

01:24.550 --> 01:30.700
similar to what we have done already before meaning there's gonna be some kind of element and the difference

01:30.700 --> 01:31.780
would be you.

01:31.780 --> 01:34.790
We were going to have to include the phantasm to our document.

01:34.850 --> 01:37.170
Is going to be the first step which we're gonna do in a second.

01:37.420 --> 01:42.050
But the moment we have it included in the document we need to create an AI element.

01:42.070 --> 01:46.960
So this is where I'm saying something similar because we would need to create an element and then for

01:46.960 --> 01:50.860
this element we're going to have the classes depending on the name of your icon.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.580
This is where you're gonna be choosing different class color.

01:53.620 --> 01:55.030
Don't skip on this first one.

01:55.030 --> 02:00.940
You need to include IFRS or if there's gonna be different type of icons that would need F A B.

02:00.970 --> 02:05.440
Now there might be and also the pro one that's the one you need to pay more.

02:05.440 --> 02:06.430
This one says regular.

02:06.430 --> 02:10.770
But as far as I remember and this was for the pro one you had to pay.

02:10.790 --> 02:13.700
And this was the FIA.

02:13.990 --> 02:14.890
What else what else.

02:14.890 --> 02:18.840
As we're scrolling down that night tell us pretty much what would be defined.

02:18.830 --> 02:22.020
Wait we don't really care about that styling.

02:22.130 --> 02:23.440
We're going to cover in a second.

02:23.440 --> 02:28.810
The moment we're going to have actually in a document this is gonna be another styling.

02:29.110 --> 02:33.250
Yeah that would be pretty much when the docs here we would have the icons.

02:33.520 --> 02:39.490
So whenever you want to search for icons you just click on icons and go ahead just pick whatever icon

02:39.490 --> 02:41.610
you would like or if I would want.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.170
I don't know Amelia or Android.

02:43.180 --> 02:48.370
I just click on it and you're gonna get the syntax now like I said for Android let's say this is gonna

02:48.370 --> 02:51.580
be a baby and then the name FAA Android.

02:52.180 --> 02:57.990
Now if we're gonna head over back to the old icons let me show you just one with their face just so

02:57.990 --> 03:02.000
you don't think that I'm pulling the wool over your ears.

03:02.260 --> 03:06.620
Let's say archive maybe hopefully this is gonna be a face and yes it is.

03:06.620 --> 03:13.620
So this is gonna be a face that would be another type of syntax How can I start working with Phantasm

03:13.820 --> 03:14.620
no guy.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.550
Let's have a look.

03:16.630 --> 03:21.730
We have the start option so let's clip on the star option and the first thing they provide you is right

03:21.730 --> 03:25.240
away C.D. in the moment we're gonna understand the general syntax.

03:25.240 --> 03:30.190
I'll show you how to download and I'm also gonna explain why am I downloading.

03:30.190 --> 03:34.120
You don't have to download but I'll get to give you my reasons for it.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.160
Let's copy this right away.

03:36.190 --> 03:38.980
So it tells us that it has been copied.

03:39.040 --> 03:44.840
We're going to head over back to the head element and in this case above the style sheet and maybe let's

03:44.950 --> 03:53.030
add the some kind of comment here let's say customs here says Just so we can see not comes time and

03:53.080 --> 03:56.600
this is gonna be our sources within the body what we're gonna do.

03:56.650 --> 04:03.010
Well let's create these two icons let's say in the beginning because I don't think we need anymore to

04:03.010 --> 04:08.020
actually understand the basics of it on the first one like I said this would be the element and we can

04:08.020 --> 04:08.920
still use the iMac.

04:09.040 --> 04:15.130
So this hasn't changed and then we're gonna have the AI and they're all gonna be looking for class in

04:15.130 --> 04:21.130
my case I'm going to say Hefei Yes I have a home that would be a name that the icon that I'm looking

04:21.130 --> 04:22.960
for a moment I'm going to save it.

04:22.960 --> 04:28.600
Notice what's gonna happen in the document in the browser I'm gonna have my whole icon I'm just to give

04:28.600 --> 04:34.460
you a heads up if you want to control the height of the icon you can use their own classes.

04:34.570 --> 04:39.640
I always prefer to do it in my CEO says because I feel like I have more control over it because then

04:39.640 --> 04:44.920
I don't have to jump back in from the document and actually changing in here because I understand you're

04:44.920 --> 04:46.670
changing this in the HCM mail.

04:46.870 --> 04:52.540
So if you're going to add that in let's say 15 places I find it easier if we're going to set up actual

04:52.540 --> 04:55.110
class with the actual value.

04:55.210 --> 05:01.590
But again this is your option so you can say something like 5 x there's gonna be different values you

05:01.590 --> 05:07.800
can go with 1 X let's say this is going to be 1 x then we have 10x that would be the biggest one and

05:07.800 --> 05:09.260
so on and so forth.

05:09.480 --> 05:15.150
Again if that's really something you're interested you can head over the documentation export more.

05:15.330 --> 05:17.390
I don't prefer doing this way again.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.410
I told you my reasons but you can do really whatever you'd like.

05:21.450 --> 05:22.590
Awesome.

05:22.600 --> 05:27.990
We have our basic one and you know what I will gonna leave the size just so we can see actually better

05:27.990 --> 05:29.280
in a browser at the moment.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.700
So I'm gonna say something like 5 x.

05:31.710 --> 05:37.170
So now we're gonna have the big icon if we want to add some custom styling we can just head over back

05:37.170 --> 05:43.410
to the C assess and then remember we had a class name we have this class of f a home we can actually

05:43.410 --> 05:45.430
styled this in CFA.

05:45.770 --> 05:51.810
Now the name is important again if you're going to name this FAA orange obviously I'm gonna get in the

05:51.810 --> 05:52.610
class.

05:52.600 --> 05:57.510
However if I'm going to be targeted this class I'm going to say that the color of my home on corn is

05:57.510 --> 05:58.460
gonna be green.

05:58.470 --> 06:00.070
What do you see in a browser.

06:00.070 --> 06:02.070
Here is the green color icon.

06:02.100 --> 06:06.390
We also have an option of working some with some kind of a parent element.

06:06.410 --> 06:12.420
Second say span here and then let's maybe add the Facebook icon just so you can see that we can work

06:12.420 --> 06:13.610
with FNB.

06:13.620 --> 06:18.960
Now I'm gonna do a little bit of a shortcut that I haven't been doing and I'm gonna show you that actually

06:18.960 --> 06:24.560
in amateur video where we can just have the element and then dot and then we're adding the classes.

06:24.630 --> 06:27.470
So in my class we're gonna see a phase book.

06:27.500 --> 06:33.000
The result is gonna be exactly the same all going to be getting our element with our classes and I will

06:33.000 --> 06:39.590
gonna show you that in the video but in general this is how it's gonna speed up your workflow.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.360
We have the icon of the parent element.

06:42.360 --> 06:47.950
Why don't we add the class and let's say you're probably all the same class and we can use the idea

06:47.970 --> 06:49.620
we can target the actual element.

06:49.740 --> 06:56.370
Again it's really up to you and we're going to call the social icon and within the styles we can do

06:56.370 --> 07:01.320
the same thing we already did with a social icon.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.460
And now let's.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.780
I don't know what the font size.

07:03.770 --> 07:09.580
Like I said we can add the font size bigger so in our case since this is gonna be font awesome icons

07:09.940 --> 07:17.050
we can use the font size because we're all gonna be able to access the size with the this property and

07:17.050 --> 07:19.150
then let's say for our yams.

07:19.150 --> 07:25.740
So now there's just gonna be much more bigger and we can maybe add the color of I don't know Blue.

07:26.050 --> 07:28.350
This is gonna be my icon with a bold color.

07:28.660 --> 07:35.020
So those of these two options how we can access it with AC it says now I'd like to head over back to

07:35.290 --> 07:42.040
my Phantasm documentation and go why I would like to download especially why am I downloading for the

07:42.040 --> 07:42.770
project.

07:42.910 --> 07:44.620
The font awesome icon.

07:44.620 --> 07:51.430
Well here's the thing I really like font awesome icons but what's really sometimes annoying is the fact

07:51.430 --> 07:58.000
that they're updating their versions and they're changing some type of syntax just to give you an example

07:58.360 --> 08:01.900
when they switch to fire some five in the beginning.

08:01.900 --> 08:07.810
You only could styled with the parent element in the font awesome for you were actually able to access

08:07.810 --> 08:10.730
the class like this when it was sitting in high element.

08:10.930 --> 08:17.920
But then once they rolled out the font some 5 in the beginning you can style this only by accessing

08:17.920 --> 08:18.860
the parent on.

08:19.030 --> 08:21.840
Now they're back again where you can style the class.

08:21.960 --> 08:28.540
What happens is that if you include the CDM the CDM technically is just going to be dealing with whatever

08:28.540 --> 08:29.500
icons you have.

08:29.650 --> 08:30.460
So far so good.

08:30.460 --> 08:35.790
So that would be good enough for your project but in my case if somebody is watching that story all

08:35.790 --> 08:42.880
day are including their own CDO unless they're obviously using the source files but what happens is

08:42.880 --> 08:48.880
that they're using their own CDM and then the version has already updated and then they're trying to

08:48.880 --> 08:55.870
let's say styles their icons with just accessing the class of a home and for that particular reason

08:55.870 --> 09:02.170
they cannot do it for that particular version and they're mad because they're like well excuse me you

09:02.170 --> 09:07.960
are doing this material and you are able to access your font awesome icons directly with this class

09:08.260 --> 09:12.520
you're on the font awesome but then I would have to do it here with the parent.

09:12.580 --> 09:18.550
So that's the reason why I always like to include actually download different awesome icons include

09:18.550 --> 09:22.640
them in a set of files and then once they're in a set of files I can say hey listen.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.780
So I'm doing this Oriel if you want to follow along.

09:25.780 --> 09:26.680
Exactly.

09:26.680 --> 09:32.140
I don't know whether the font or some version has changed but you can always access the ones that I

09:32.140 --> 09:34.550
was using again long story short.

09:34.630 --> 09:40.300
It just saves me a time later on as they roll out the new versions of phantasm.

09:40.510 --> 09:47.470
After all this talking and yammering about unnecessary stuff maybe for you I'm gonna head over to download

09:47.740 --> 09:50.080
because that's where we get the icons.

09:50.080 --> 09:54.820
You can click on over here and first all that we're gonna tell you right away what files you would need

09:54.820 --> 09:55.750
to include.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.100
You want to use the SPG.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.010
Use this file.

09:58.210 --> 10:00.930
You want to use this RSS version use all CSA.

10:01.300 --> 10:07.410
However one thing that is very important is to have the whole folder there.

10:07.480 --> 10:14.480
So don't just drag and drop the file because the file is going to be looking for the actual folder.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.770
Now in order to do that let's just actually click it.

10:17.770 --> 10:23.350
Now we're starting to download I'm going to head over back to my actual documents and find out I'm gonna

10:23.350 --> 10:30.180
go to download and this is gonna be my Phantasm and I'm going to open up the zip file I'm just gonna

10:30.190 --> 10:37.390
say that I would like to copy this and let's copy this and within the sources not just copy and paste.

10:37.780 --> 10:39.480
Now this is gonna be my fantasy.

10:39.910 --> 10:40.570
Good.

10:40.630 --> 10:41.710
I have my fantasy.

10:41.730 --> 10:42.640
Now what's next.

10:42.980 --> 10:46.130
Well first of all let me show you what happens if we don't have the link.

10:46.360 --> 10:50.960
So I'm gonna delete this and Phantasm icons are gonna be gone.

10:51.250 --> 10:58.750
But then remember we have the option of looking for this file whether all GSL also says well let's look

10:58.750 --> 10:59.530
for it.

10:59.530 --> 11:01.980
So here again we would need to use the link.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.370
And then what am I doing.

11:03.490 --> 11:05.210
Well I'm looking for phantasm.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.420
That's my folder.

11:06.420 --> 11:10.870
Now I already know that CSL is going to be located there so I'm just gonna head over for to see assess

11:11.320 --> 11:12.950
and then I'm looking for all CSL.

11:13.290 --> 11:14.350
That's gonna be my.

11:14.770 --> 11:21.010
If you named your folder differently here then I understand that you need to look for the folder where

11:21.010 --> 11:22.870
you have your fantasy icon.

11:22.870 --> 11:24.300
And now I have no.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.960
And that's pretty much going to be in short how we can include fonts.

11:28.010 --> 11:33.220
My constant project and start using them and we will gonna use them a lot throughout our project.

11:33.220 --> 11:35.920
So you will really get to know font awesome icons.
