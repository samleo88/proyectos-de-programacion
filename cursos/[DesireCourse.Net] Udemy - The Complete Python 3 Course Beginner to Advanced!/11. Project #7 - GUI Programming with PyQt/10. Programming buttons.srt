1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,199
Alright, so, what we're going to be doing

2

00:00:01,199  -->  00:00:04,049
now is entering these buttons in a more

3

00:00:04,049  -->  00:00:06,509
dynamic way. Now when we think about how

4

00:00:06,509  -->  00:00:09,000
we're going to be adding the buttons we

5

00:00:09,000  -->  00:00:10,740
don't want to be typing all of them out

6

00:00:10,740  -->  00:00:12,300
right there. So what we're going to do is

7

00:00:12,300  -->  00:00:15,240
remove all this, so remove the button

8

00:00:15,240  -->  00:00:17,730
declarations and the adding the widgets.

9

00:00:17,730  -->  00:00:20,130
What we're going to do is we're going to

10

00:00:20,130  -->  00:00:23,910
create a list called buttons, and it's

11

00:00:23,910  -->  00:00:25,800
going to be in the order of the buttons

12

00:00:25,800  -->  00:00:29,130
we want. So on the top row we want to see

13

00:00:29,130  -->  00:00:33,390
an AC button, this is going to reset it,

14

00:00:33,390  -->  00:00:36,630
it's going to be a placeholder for now,

15

00:00:36,630  -->  00:00:45,030
placeholder, and division. On the next row

16

00:00:45,030  -->  00:00:48,840
we want the numbers 7, 8, 9, and

17

00:00:48,840  -->  00:00:57,090
multiply. On the next row we want 4, 5, 6,

18

00:00:57,090  -->  00:01:05,189
and minus, put the plus down under it. On

19

00:01:05,189  -->  00:01:09,750
the next row we want 1, 2, 3, and

20

00:01:09,750  -->  00:01:16,170
then plus, and on the very bottom line we

21

00:01:16,170  -->  00:01:22,140
want 0, a decimal, and then the equal

22

00:01:22,140  -->  00:01:27,450
sign. So what we're going to do with this

23

00:01:27,450  -->  00:01:30,329
is we're going to say for button in buttons,

24

00:01:30,329  -->  00:01:33,930
add a button to the grid. So how

25

00:01:33,930  -->  00:01:35,430
we're going to do that we need to know

26

00:01:35,430  -->  00:01:39,270
how many rows and columns have been used

27

00:01:39,270  -->  00:01:46,799
up. So, let's go ahead and for button in

28

00:01:46,799  -->  00:01:49,649
buttons: we are going to need a few

29

00:01:49,649  -->  00:01:53,040
variables. So, row, the current row that

30

00:01:53,040  -->  00:01:54,960
we're on, and then column is going to be the

31

00:01:54,960  -->  00:01:56,640
current column we're on, so they're both going

32

00:01:56,640  -->  00:01:58,799
to start at zero. So what we're going to

33

00:01:58,799  -->  00:02:04,290
do here is grid.addWidget and we're

34

00:02:04,290  -->  00:02:07,969
going to add the button itself,

35

00:02:09,509  -->  00:02:13,080
but we're going to add a QPushButton.

36

00:02:13,080  -->  00:02:21,959
So, the widget that we're going to

37

00:02:21,959  -->  00:02:23,430
be adding to the grid is a QPush

38

00:02:23,430  -->  00:02:26,250
Button with the button's value in it because

39

00:02:26,250  -->  00:02:29,340
we're accessing that through here. Now some of

40

00:02:29,340  -->  00:02:30,870
these are going to be strings and some

41

00:02:30,870  -->  00:02:33,450
of them are integers, so what we need to

42

00:02:33,450  -->  00:02:37,019
do is manually create strings just in

43

00:02:37,019  -->  00:02:41,280
case it is an integer. And now we need to

44

00:02:41,280  -->  00:02:47,220
set the rows and column number. So, for

45

00:02:47,220  -->  00:02:53,760
instance it's going to be row, column,

46

00:02:53,760  -->  00:03:00,480
and then 1 and 1. And then what we

47

00:03:00,480  -->  00:03:04,859
need to do is increase row, so row +=,

48

00:03:04,859  -->  00:03:13,379
actually no col += row, and we

49

00:03:13,379  -->  00:03:19,799
need to be able to set the row

50

00:03:19,799  -->  00:03:23,280
based on how many columns have been

51

00:03:23,280  -->  00:03:25,290
used. So, this is going to be a little

52

00:03:25,290  -->  00:03:28,290
confusing. In the beginning of this

53

00:03:28,290  -->  00:03:31,680
loop here we're going to say if column

54

00:03:31,680  -->  00:03:33,750
is more than 3,

55

00:03:33,750  -->  00:03:39,299
we're going to set column = to 0, so

56

00:03:39,299  -->  00:03:40,799
we're going to start over again, then we're

57

00:03:40,799  -->  00:03:43,199
going to set row += 1 so this is going

58

00:03:43,199  -->  00:03:47,549
to make it skip rows.

59

00:03:47,549  -->  00:03:52,079
Let's go ahead and save this, and run the

60

00:03:52,079  -->  00:03:55,530
application, and as you can see we've

61

00:03:55,530  -->  00:03:58,079
magically built our calculator already

62

00:03:58,079  -->  00:04:01,470
within a grid simply by iterating

63

00:04:01,470  -->  00:04:03,120
through these numbers. One thing you'll

64

00:04:03,120  -->  00:04:06,150
notice though is at the bottom here it

65

00:04:06,150  -->  00:04:09,060
doesn't really look right. So, what we're

66

00:04:09,060  -->  00:04:10,590
going to do is we're going to make this

67

00:04:10,590  -->  00:04:13,319
take up two columns, and the way we're

68

00:04:13,319  -->  00:04:18,930
going to do that is basically if button

69

00:04:18,930  -->  00:04:21,680
== 0:

70

00:04:21,680  -->  00:04:23,330
we're going to do something different. So,

71

00:04:23,330  -->  00:04:28,430
grid.addWidget(QPushButton) and it's

72

00:04:28,430  -->  00:04:33,080
going to take in string button, and then the other

73

00:04:33,080  -->  00:04:36,800
parameters we're going to say row, column, it's

74

00:04:36,800  -->  00:04:39,860
going to take up 1 row and 2 columns.

75

00:04:39,860  -->  00:04:44,000
So that's what's going to happen if our

76

00:04:44,000  -->  00:04:47,389
button is the 0, otherwise it's just going to

77

00:04:47,389  -->  00:04:49,940
do what we just told it to do before we

78

00:04:49,940  -->  00:04:51,080
added that bit of code.

79

00:04:51,080  -->  00:04:55,340
So now we should see that our 0 is two spaces wide,

80

00:04:55,340  -->  00:04:58,160
and what we're going to have to do is we

81

00:04:58,160  -->  00:05:00,080
need to tell it that we've just used two

82

00:05:00,080  -->  00:05:01,699
spaces so that the next one should go

83

00:05:01,699  -->  00:05:04,639
into the next column, and so we're going

84

00:05:04,639  -->  00:05:11,960
to set column here += 1 again. This

85

00:05:11,960  -->  00:05:14,000
is going to increment it by the correct

86

00:05:14,000  -->  00:05:16,460
amount, and basically what's happening,

87

00:05:16,460  -->  00:05:20,360
what happened before is 0 was set to

88

00:05:20,360  -->  00:05:22,910
column 0, and the period was still set to

89

00:05:22,910  -->  00:05:25,699
column 1 even though this one is

90

00:05:25,699  -->  00:05:27,949
taking up two spaces, so we just add an

91

00:05:27,949  -->  00:05:30,949
additional 1 into the column variable,

92

00:05:30,949  -->  00:05:33,889
in addition to the other one that we're

93

00:05:33,889  -->  00:05:35,870
already adding. I hope that makes sense.

94

00:05:35,870  -->  00:05:41,270
Now what we've got here is the basic

95

00:05:41,270  -->  00:05:45,320
calculator itself but it's not going to

96

00:05:45,320  -->  00:05:48,979
work just yet, and that's because there's

97

00:05:48,979  -->  00:05:52,550
no button event. So, what we're going to

98

00:05:52,550  -->  00:05:54,680
do is to wrap up this video we're just going

99

00:05:54,680  -->  00:05:59,240
to create a line edit up here on the

100

00:05:59,240  -->  00:06:04,940
top. So, our results is going to be equal

101

00:06:04,940  -->  00:06:11,000
to QLineEdit, and then before we start

102

00:06:11,000  -->  00:06:12,740
adding the buttons and everything we're

103

00:06:12,740  -->  00:06:18,110
going to say I grid.addWidget, and we're

104

00:06:18,110  -->  00:06:24,979
going to add the results in row 0, 0,

105

00:06:24,979  -->  00:06:29,750
actually, yeah we can do this. It's going to

106

00:06:29,750  -->  00:06:31,910
take up 4 rows, and

107

00:06:31,910  -->  00:06:33,320
4 lines, and then we're going to

108

00:06:33,320  -->  00:06:35,720
manually adjust the row here so that

109

00:06:35,720  -->  00:06:39,020
the buttons start on row 1. We're going

110

00:06:39,020  -->  00:06:40,580
to rerun the application, and we're going

111

00:06:40,580  -->  00:06:42,290
to see something that's a little bit

112

00:06:42,290  -->  00:06:48,230
messed up. So what we're going to do is

113

00:06:48,230  -->  00:06:55,310
we're going to set this to use one row,

114

00:06:55,310  -->  00:06:58,010
yeah that's my mistake, that was set to

115

00:06:58,010  -->  00:06:59,660
use four rows instead of one. So now

116

00:06:59,660  -->  00:07:02,060
our calculator is looking a bit better and

117

00:07:02,060  -->  00:07:04,310
we can actually type stuff in, but it

118

00:07:04,310  -->  00:07:07,930
doesn't do anything just yet.
