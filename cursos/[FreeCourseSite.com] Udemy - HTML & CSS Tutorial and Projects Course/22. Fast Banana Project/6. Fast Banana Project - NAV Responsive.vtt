WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:04.660
And for the responsiveness the first thing that we would need is media screen.

00:04.660 --> 00:12.640
So I'm going to say what the media are going to say screen and say and our hero can write men with you

00:12.640 --> 00:15.300
know this and this is going to be 576.

00:15.390 --> 00:15.890
Right.

00:15.960 --> 00:19.990
You know what's our servants six 776 pixels.

00:20.000 --> 00:20.850
All right.

00:21.030 --> 00:24.640
Then after that we would want the actual cursor curly braces right.

00:24.920 --> 00:26.150
And here we're going to write a rule.

00:26.180 --> 00:33.740
So I'm going to say Nav. hang on here I'm going to say border first rights of water top say border up

00:33.810 --> 00:41.980
and this is going to be five pixels solid no real going to say F F C and this is going to be 9 1 4.

00:42.090 --> 00:44.260
Right so this is going to be the code.

00:44.490 --> 00:49.650
Then after that we're going to have a display and we're going to say flex on here and we're going to

00:49.650 --> 00:51.130
have a background.

00:51.420 --> 00:57.030
So first we're going to have display flex just so they wouldn't be here in a column and we're here to

00:57.030 --> 01:02.950
say background's going to be hash tag it's going to be too easy for you too.

01:03.060 --> 01:04.870
And then we're going to have a two.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.790
Hate you.

01:07.260 --> 01:13.970
So we say this and this and if we go back over here we're fresh right now I can see what we have.

01:13.970 --> 01:14.400
Right.

01:14.550 --> 01:18.810
So first of all this is going to be you can see that this is displaying flex right.

01:18.840 --> 01:24.580
And here you can see that what we have right here we have these links over here right here.

01:24.600 --> 01:30.240
We just need to set them in flex so we're going to go back over here and we're going to go and work

01:30.240 --> 01:31.900
with the help.

01:31.980 --> 01:33.150
And we're going to solve now.

01:33.190 --> 01:40.530
You will have on our list or here we're going to say first that we would want a display and we're going

01:40.530 --> 01:44.030
to say flex and or here we're going to right away important.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.800
And we're actually at a comment here right.

01:46.950 --> 01:50.340
Because I'm going to show you why we are doing this important that I can show you this.

01:50.520 --> 01:56.940
Once we have all this button working with Jake we here we're going to say first that we would want a

01:56.940 --> 02:03.580
flex right over here and we would want actually 1 0 or 0.

02:03.660 --> 02:04.680
And what I mean by that.

02:04.680 --> 02:05.110
Right.

02:05.250 --> 02:09.060
So basically what's happening is that we would want.

02:09.120 --> 02:09.760
Right.

02:09.780 --> 02:12.960
We know that not only this is a flex parent right now.

02:13.140 --> 02:15.230
But this is also a child right.

02:15.330 --> 02:21.860
And we would want actually for the child to grow and not shrink and to have all the bases.

02:21.970 --> 02:24.810
So we're going to go back over here because the pressure here.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.150
Right.

02:25.170 --> 02:27.460
And you can see what we have right.

02:27.540 --> 02:33.340
So what I'm going to say here is I'm going to say this I'm going to say that this is going to be flex.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.600
So this is I'm still talking as a trial.

02:36.150 --> 02:40.440
Here zero and this is going to be all this.

02:40.500 --> 02:46.080
Then after that would we would want is actually have a justified content.

02:46.080 --> 02:46.350
Right.

02:46.390 --> 02:49.400
And we're going to have a space around this.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.350
This is going to be for links like this right.

02:52.360 --> 02:55.030
And I can see space around and you know what.

02:55.050 --> 03:00.030
Right away what we can do is just get rid of this and get rid of links and get rid of it.

03:00.180 --> 03:09.870
But I'm going to say over here that this is going to be a icons and I'm going to say this play non sense

03:09.940 --> 03:14.790
so I'm getting rid of them now so I can get rid of toggle button so I'm going to say I'm here.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.750
Hash tag tar go we're here to say between and it's all going to say this.

03:21.820 --> 03:26.600
Now once we go back to the bigger screen and you can see that both of them are disappearing right.

03:26.770 --> 03:31.740
And I can see that we have all of them actually space around right hand.

03:31.750 --> 03:34.750
You can see that list is taking the whole space.

03:34.760 --> 03:39.760
Then will when one is would want to go back over here with the space around and first of all going to

03:39.760 --> 03:41.040
say a line center.

03:41.150 --> 03:43.380
And so we're going to place him actually in the center.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.810
You can see that they're not sitting in the center right now.

03:45.910 --> 03:53.180
So I'm going to say a line and I'm going to say a line on line self here.

03:53.240 --> 04:00.940
Place them in a base line so isn't there or you know this then we're going to have a flex wrap right.

04:01.090 --> 04:05.190
Just in case as I'm actually going to the smaller screen right.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.620
You need to wrap.

04:06.650 --> 04:08.730
They were actually going to go to the new line.

04:08.830 --> 04:09.080
Right.

04:09.190 --> 04:15.310
So I'm going to say we're here for X wrap and we're going to say we're here wrap like this and then

04:15.310 --> 04:16.850
we're going to have a little bit of padding.

04:17.080 --> 04:25.440
So I'm going to say a padding 0 and 10 pixels on this and we were fresher here right.

04:25.450 --> 04:27.220
And now we have wings.

04:27.310 --> 04:30.550
Then after that we would want a list item.

04:30.610 --> 04:32.020
So I'm going to say we're here like this.

04:32.020 --> 04:37.520
I'm going to say first for a have on our list list item.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.200
What I would want right.

04:39.340 --> 04:41.320
Actually I would want again flex.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.220
So I'm going to say over here grow as much as you can.

04:44.470 --> 04:50.870
Don't shrink and have 100 hundred pixels or here as your base what are you going to refresh.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.690
Right now you can see what happens right.

04:52.810 --> 04:55.780
So now we're taking the whole space or here with these links.

04:56.050 --> 05:04.470
But over here probably what we would want is for this link read to have a text align center.

05:04.770 --> 05:08.640
So I'm going to say here now if you will lie.

05:08.930 --> 05:17.200
Hey we're here we're going to write more we're going to say whatever it is first right we're going to

05:17.200 --> 05:22.270
say important really if this is going to be five pixels so it has those rounded edges and then we're

05:22.270 --> 05:29.710
going to say text line say Center and we say this and then we were fresh.

05:29.710 --> 05:35.220
Now I can see it all our links actually have the text line center right.

05:35.260 --> 05:39.610
You can see that they're taking the whole space right because I was hovering You can see how they're

05:39.610 --> 05:41.380
actually going side by side.

05:41.530 --> 05:41.970
Right.

05:42.160 --> 05:46.910
And you can see that actually everything isn't working and as I'm going the screen gets bigger.

05:47.010 --> 05:47.250
Right.

05:47.260 --> 05:50.590
You can still see that they're actually growing as much as they can.

05:50.590 --> 05:54.850
But as I'm going to the smaller screen right this is how it's going to look like right.

05:54.880 --> 05:59.590
You can see the end we're going to switch back and forth right now mostly now and we would want is actually

05:59.590 --> 06:01.150
to work with the toggle button.

06:01.350 --> 06:01.670
All right.

06:01.690 --> 06:02.910
And this is what we're going to do.

06:02.910 --> 06:04.930
Next video we're going to create this toggle button.
