00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:05,640
Hey guys, welcome back. So between the
last video and this video I've added a

2

00:00:05,640  -->  00:00:09,719
bit of style to make it look a bit
better, hopefully you guys have added at

3

00:00:09,719  -->  00:00:15,389
least a navbar as well. I'm going to go
ahead and show you guys what I've done,

4

00:00:15,389  -->  00:00:18,390
and if you want to pause the video and
do something similar,

5

00:00:18,900  -->  00:00:22,320
go for it.

6

00:00:22,320  -->  00:00:25,650
I just don't want to take up too much
time like doing things that you might

7

00:00:25,650  -->  00:00:31,080
not want to do, so most of the styling
and additional stuff i'm probably going

8

00:00:31,080  -->  00:00:39,840
to do between videos and then we will review it in the next video. So, in each video at

9

00:00:39,840  -->  00:00:43,079
the end I'm going to tell you guys what
you should have ready for the next video,

10

00:00:43,079  -->  00:00:47,399
and you can do that stuff on your own. So
I've created a nav bar &lt;div class="navbar

11

00:00:47,399  -->  00:00:53,039
navbar.info navbar-fixed-top"&gt; "&lt;a class="navbar-brand"&gt;CodeWizard,/a." and then I've

12

00:00:53,039  -->  00:00:59,520
created navigation here, and I've got
"Home Feed" "discover "profile" and "settings"

13

00:00:59,520  -->  00:01:03,359
these are all pages that we are going to
create here, i've also got a button over

14

00:01:03,359  -->  00:01:08,430
here this says "register" Now, the bootstrap material if you haven't used it yet it

15

00:01:08,430  -->  00:01:14,460
comes with his awesome waves affect, and how we use that is just add the

16

00:01:14,460  -->  00:01:23,130
class="waves-effect" to buttons and links and stuff, and it will do that ripple thing

17

00:01:23,130  -->  00:01:23,939
that you see.

18

00:01:23,939  -->  00:01:28,500
However, before we do that we've actually
got to get jquery going and we need to

19

00:01:28,500  -->  00:01:33,030
initialize the JavaScript here for
material, and so what I'm going to do is

20

00:01:33,030  -->  00:01:45,030
go to "jquery.com" and i'm going to
download jquery3.1.0, here it is right

21

00:01:45,030  -->  00:01:57,659
there. I'm going to go back in to static, css going to drag that right over here,

22

00:01:57,659  -->  00:02:02,130
oh, into the javascript file actually,
there we go.

23

00:02:02,130  -->  00:02:08,369
So if i go into the JavaScript we'll see
which javascript files i'm going to have

24

00:02:08,369  -->  00:02:13,660
to include. It's going to be a jquery, and
then bootstrap,

25

00:02:13,660  -->  00:02:21,190
and then material, and also the ripples.
So, we're going to do that similar to the

26

00:02:21,190  -->  00:02:43,120
css files, so "$var static/js/jquery-3.1.0.min.js

27

00:02:43,120  -->  00:02:47,200
static/js/

28

00:02:48,070  -->  00:03:00,070
bootstrap.min.js static/js/material.min.js

29

00:03:00,070  -->  00:03:10,750
static/js/ripples.min.js" Alright, there.

30

00:03:10,750  -->  00:03:14,650
we go. These are the four javascript
files that we we are going to need to

31

00:03:14,650  -->  00:03:20,890
include. It's common practice with jquery
to include it just before the closing

32

00:03:20,890  -->  00:03:25,480
body tag here, so let's go ahead and do
something similar to what we did up here

33

00:03:25,480  -->  00:03:35,560
with the css. So, "$if.js:" we're
going to go "$for

34

00:03:36,310  -->  00:03:45,489
scripts in self.js.split( )" we're
going to split it here, and then we're going

35

00:03:45,489  -->  00:03:55,450
to print out "&lt;script src="$script&lt;&gt;/script&gt;" and we're going

36

00:03:55,450  -->  00:04:02,290
to save it. And then outside of here
we're going to create our own script to

37

00:04:02,290  -->  00:04:06,850
initialize I material. So,

38

00:04:12,160  -->  00:04:18,670
"$.material.init( );" I might have to put that
into a document, i'm not sure. Let's go

39

00:04:18,670  -->  00:04:25,870
ahead and restart this, and we've got an
issue on line 45.

40

00:04:27,970  -->  00:04:32,080
Alright, I think it's because we're using
a dollar sign here and it doesn't know

41

00:04:32,080  -->  00:04:36,460
what that is because we're using jquery,
so we're going to do is we're actually

42

00:04:36,460  -->  00:04:43,210
going to just create our own external
javascript file for use in here, it's going to

43

00:04:43,210  -->  00:04:44,380
make it a lot easier.

44

00:04:44,380  -->  00:04:50,590
So, what I'm going to do is go ahead and
create a new javascript file, and i'm going

45

00:04:50,590  -->  00:05:03,880
to name it "scripty" and I'll
paste this in here. So in MainLayout i'm

46

00:05:03,880  -->  00:05:09,010
going to add that "static/js/

47

00:05:11,290  -->  00:05:21,370
scripty.js so that will get it loaded
into the page on its own. So what we're

48

00:05:21,370  -->  00:05:28,419
going to do now is we've got our
JavaScript included we're going to

49

00:05:28,419  -->  00:05:32,800
create a form, so what we need to do is
in the controller here let's create another

50

00:05:32,800  -->  00:05:33,700
route, and

51

00:05:33,700  -->  00:05:42,160
let's call it '/register', and it's going to
connect to the 'register' class here. So

52

00:05:42,160  -->  00:05:45,160
let's go ahead and define that "class register:" "def GET(self): "return render.Register( )"

53

00:05:52,020  -->  00:06:09,720
Now let's go ahead and create the
"Register" page, and in here i'm just going to

54

00:06:09,720  -->  00:06:17,639
create a form. So, I believe the container
is in the page of the pages themselves.

55

00:06:17,639  -->  00:06:20,610
What I'm going to do is get this out of
here because I don't want to add that to

56

00:06:20,610  -->  00:06:28,889
every page, and i'm just going to paste
it right here, and this basically makes

57

00:06:28,889  -->  00:06:33,870
it where the navbar is floating, it
doesn't, the content doesn't go

58

00:06:33,870  -->  00:06:42,810
underneath it. So, what I'm going to do
is "&lt;div class"container"&gt;" and i'm going to

59

00:06:42,810  -->  00:06:52,080
add a "&lt;h2&gt;Register Account&lt;/h2&gt;" and on this page we are going to need a

60

00:06:52,080  -->  00:06:57,870
few fields of information. So what we're
going to do is we're going to create

61

00:06:57,870  -->  00:07:10,080
some material drop inputs, and as you can see I want this one right here, so

62

00:07:10,080  -->  00:07:17,039
I'm just going to look at this, and it's
just a regular input with the label

63

00:07:17,039  -->  00:07:26,039
static, yeah. It also has a hint there, I
don't know if I like the hint or not, we

64

00:07:26,039  -->  00:07:34,919
could use that though, so. Let's go ahead
and create a username input "&lt;div class=

65

00:07:34,919  -->  00:07:43,860
'form-group label-static"&gt;"

66

00:07:47,529  -->  00:08:00,039
and it's going to be empty by default so
"is-empty" as well "&lt;label for="username"

67

00:08:00,039  -->  00:08:15,729
class="control-label"&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;"
&lt;input id="username"

68

00:08:15,729  -->  00:08:29,439
class="form-control" type="text" placeholder="Choose a username" /&gt;"

69

00:08:29,439  -->  00:08:43,899
Let's go ahead and save this,
going to rerun the application here,

70

00:08:43,899  -->  00:08:50,860
refresh this, and go to the register page. So as you can see I've got the register

71

00:08:50,860  -->  00:08:56,800
account and it's now starting to ask for
information. So I'm actually going to

72

00:08:56,800  -->  00:09:06,309
drop down a little bit between the title
and that field, going to create another

73

00:09:06,309  -->  00:09:07,990
input for email address

74

00:09:07,990  -->  00:09:14,199
we're going to want that, and then down
here we need a button. So "&lt;button class=

75

00:09:14,199  -->  00:09:27,819
"btn btn-info waves-effect ripple"&gt;Submit &lt;div class=

76

00:09:35,459  -->  00:09:59,970
"ripple-container"&lt;/button&gt;" Go ahead and save this and reload, something

77

00:09:59,970  -->  00:10:10,350
happened there that I don't like, oh "from
group" right there, that's what it was.

78

00:10:10,350  -->  00:10:16,110
Alright, reload here and we'll see it looks
a little better, and a submit button right

79

00:10:16,110  -->  00:10:16,769
there.

80

00:10:16,769  -->  00:10:22,470
Still those ripples are not working. I
will troubleshoot that between now and

81

00:10:22,470  -->  00:10:28,679
the next video and yeah we'll figure
that out. So i'm going to make this into an

82

00:10:28,679  -->  00:10:39,179
actual form just by adding the word "&lt;form&gt;" around it, and I'm going to have to

83

00:10:39,179  -->  00:10:47,790
indent the entire form itself, i'm going
to move over to the JavaScript and

84

00:10:47,790  -->  00:10:57,779
basically the ID for this is going to be
"register-form" and this button is going

85

00:10:57,779  -->  00:11:03,119
to be a "submit" button, there we go.

86

00:11:03,119  -->  00:11:08,160
So that's our HTML. What we're going to
do is come over to scripty here and we're

87

00:11:08,160  -->  00:11:25,649
going to type in "$(document).on("submit", "#register-form",

88

00:11:30,130  -->  00:11:35,200
function( )" and we are going to be sending a ajax request to another route that we

89

00:11:35,200  -->  00:11:45,490
set up, it can accept posted data. So,
let's go ahead and just "console.log("form

90

00:11:45,490  -->  00:11:55,030
submitted")" that's as far as we're going
to take this video here, and I got to

91

00:11:55,030  -->  00:12:09,430
prevent default "e.preventDefault( )", that's right. Refresh and as you can see form submitted and it

92

00:12:09,430  -->  00:12:14,920
prevented the default submit type. So in the next video we're gonna be basically

93

00:12:14,920  -->  00:12:19,120
taking these fields, we're going to be
building a separate route for handling

94

00:12:19,120  -->  00:12:23,260
the data, and we're going to be putting
this into PyManga. So we're also going

95

00:12:23,260  -->  00:12:26,710
to have to build out a PyMongo class
to import.
