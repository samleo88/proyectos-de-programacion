WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:00.770
All right.

00:00.970 --> 00:06.750
While still on the subject of the units in the C assess why don't we take a look at the calc function

00:06.840 --> 00:10.450
which is really gonna help us out in a lot of cases.

00:10.620 --> 00:14.790
Now what's happening in the next session you know we're gonna set up two elements.

00:14.790 --> 00:16.650
One of them is going to be Navarre.

00:16.650 --> 00:22.220
So I'm going to say Dave and then for the class and let's give it a class number and ledges right.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.790
This is no.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.210
This obviously is not going to be real nav bar.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.530
We're just gonna set it up as a element.

00:28.530 --> 00:29.990
We are the class of number.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.320
So far so good.

00:31.350 --> 00:32.040
What else we have.

00:32.040 --> 00:36.810
Well let's say there's gonna be another Dave with a glass of Banner and then you know what.

00:36.810 --> 00:41.610
We're not going to type any kind of text in here because we're gonna be adding the background color

00:41.610 --> 00:42.870
anyway.

00:42.870 --> 00:43.360
Okay.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.140
What do we have in the CSF.

00:45.840 --> 00:50.290
Well first of all I'm going to head over back and I'm going to reset the browser styles.

00:50.290 --> 00:55.470
Any default ones because I would like to show you something with view height and I think this is just

00:55.470 --> 00:58.590
gonna make a little bit of sense if I'm going to say margin is gonna be zero.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.720
So now we're resetting the default style.

01:02.480 --> 01:02.820
Okay.

01:02.820 --> 01:03.450
What's next.

01:03.450 --> 01:09.120
Well let's say for the number since this is gonna be the class we know how to selected and we can maybe

01:09.120 --> 01:16.800
add some background first maybe background is gonna be blue and and height would be something like a

01:16.800 --> 01:18.020
hundred pixels.

01:18.130 --> 01:23.190
Well let's say I'm pixels and then we also would like to have a little bit of color.

01:23.520 --> 01:28.800
Color could be white and maybe add on a font size on our three arms.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.790
So this is gonna be our maneuver.

01:30.930 --> 01:32.170
So far so good.

01:32.310 --> 01:33.330
What is happening next.

01:33.330 --> 01:38.280
Well let's say that for Navarre I would like to hear I'm sorry for the banner.

01:38.280 --> 01:43.110
No we already styled it but for the banner I would like to add first of all the background.

01:43.860 --> 01:48.780
So let's write background is gonna be red and then we would need to have some kind of height.

01:49.110 --> 01:55.890
Well we already know we can use min height or is if the content doesn't support whatever we're having

01:55.890 --> 02:00.580
right now then at least a minimal height is gonna be whatever we're typing here.

02:00.600 --> 02:04.980
So the difference would be between the height you're just setting the height with the mean height if

02:04.980 --> 02:10.550
the content is gonna be enough in the actual element then it's obviously going to be bigger.

02:10.770 --> 02:16.370
Meaning if we're gonna be placing a bunch of text here within the banner if it gets bigger then hundred

02:16.620 --> 02:19.350
new height then obviously this is gonna be bigger.

02:19.680 --> 02:24.810
However if the content doesn't provide that much height which is this case of course because we haven't

02:24.810 --> 02:28.800
provided any kind of content then we're just sitting here what would be the value.

02:29.430 --> 02:33.350
So I'm going to say here hundred view right now what's happening.

02:33.360 --> 02:38.520
Well I can see that there's going to be an amber but then I need to scroll down for my hundred views.

02:39.210 --> 02:45.870
And that is an issue because let's imagine the situation where I would want my nav bar as well as my

02:45.870 --> 02:52.290
banner shared a hundred percent here on the screen because right now I'm having a hundred percent plus

02:52.290 --> 02:53.820
these hundred pixels correct.

02:54.330 --> 02:57.250
Well this is where the call function comes to rescue.

02:57.360 --> 03:01.620
And what's really neat about call function we can perform math operations.

03:01.620 --> 03:08.250
So addition subtraction multiplication and division as well as we make and mix and match values.

03:08.280 --> 03:14.420
So how this is gonna look like so instead of using the main height four hundred view height what I can

03:14.420 --> 03:19.190
write oh here I can say OK so this is going to be the function and then all is going to perform the

03:19.190 --> 03:20.380
math operation.

03:20.590 --> 03:21.370
And in this case.

03:21.380 --> 03:27.320
Well first of all I misspelled it but we can write whatever values we would like to be calculated so

03:27.320 --> 03:32.090
we can mix and match them I can say yeah my manhood should be hundred view height.

03:32.150 --> 03:35.330
However I would like to subtract the hundred pixels.

03:35.390 --> 03:36.560
So what I'm saying here is.

03:36.590 --> 03:42.780
Yeah make this hundred percent but get rid of whatever number what value was all here.

03:43.160 --> 03:48.590
So the moment we're going to save it now we have exactly hundred percent and this is for most cases

03:48.590 --> 03:52.390
we're all going and doing a project we're all gonna be setting up the banner and then we're going to

03:52.390 --> 03:59.220
make sure that the actual welcome page is exactly hundred percent or on review height.

03:59.390 --> 04:05.720
And for that we're gonna use the division to get rid of these whatever value would be for no color.

04:05.720 --> 04:10.700
Be careful though if you're just gonna make something if you're gonna say something like this then the

04:10.700 --> 04:11.660
cork is not gonna work.

04:12.140 --> 04:16.640
So what's happening right away it spits you back there or we can do something like this and again this

04:16.640 --> 04:17.640
is not going to work.

04:17.780 --> 04:23.970
So we need to make sure that whenever you're doing the actual calculation that there's space in between.

04:23.990 --> 04:26.920
So these assets can say what is the operator.

04:26.960 --> 04:31.250
So that would be a shorthand to a assess called function.
