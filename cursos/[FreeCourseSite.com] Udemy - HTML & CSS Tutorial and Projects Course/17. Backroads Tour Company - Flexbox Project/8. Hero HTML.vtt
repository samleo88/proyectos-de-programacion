00:00.270 --> 00:04.350
No like I said we're gonna start with our hero element.

00:04.490 --> 00:10.430
And as far as hero element is concerned we're gonna have some background here.

00:10.440 --> 00:14.170
There's gonna be also a linear gradient or background image.

00:14.460 --> 00:20.910
Then they're going to be some banner text in the center as well as the button.

00:20.910 --> 00:27.840
Now it'll also like to point out that on a smaller screen I wouldn't want to force this massive image.

00:27.900 --> 00:32.680
So that's the reason why we're gonna have only extra small screen and small screen.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.790
In fact just a primary color background.

00:35.790 --> 00:36.420
All right.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.060
Now let's start working on it.

00:39.150 --> 00:42.730
First things first we're gonna have to set up our indexation.

00:42.960 --> 00:49.650
Now the way it's going to work is I'm gonna delete right now right away the font awesome as well as

00:49.650 --> 00:50.600
this heading one.

00:51.140 --> 00:52.200
That's number one.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.470
Then let's set up some comments again.

00:54.690 --> 00:58.050
Just so it is easier for us to navigate later on.

00:58.050 --> 01:05.170
We have the header and let's write and off better now within these comments.

01:05.190 --> 01:10.600
I'm going to start by creating a header element and I'm also gonna give it the right away.

01:10.620 --> 01:17.610
A I D often like so then within the header there's going to be Nambour later on.

01:17.640 --> 01:20.460
But we're not going to work on it right now.

01:20.460 --> 01:21.270
So no.

01:21.750 --> 01:25.590
And we can right away maybe add a nav tax as well.

01:25.590 --> 01:26.820
It's really up to you.

01:27.000 --> 01:35.640
And then right after the NAV tags we're gonna have our hero component hero opponent and then as far

01:35.640 --> 01:43.410
as hero component is concerned it is going to be a div with a class of hero land within this particular

01:43.410 --> 01:44.110
div.

01:44.110 --> 01:47.190
There's going to be one more dev on this.

01:47.190 --> 01:50.220
Dev is there for the centering.

01:50.370 --> 01:57.520
So since we are going to have three children within dev but if I would like to place that div within

01:57.520 --> 01:58.080
the centre.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.940
Well I'm gonna set it up as one child.

02:01.220 --> 02:08.120
OK so we have the hero and then within the hero there's gonna be one more dev with a class of here no

02:08.130 --> 02:08.920
banner.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.570
And again the reason for the existence of this dev is because we're gonna use it for centering.

02:15.790 --> 02:16.460
OK.

02:16.620 --> 02:24.500
And then let's add within that day we're having one with a class of hero title hero title.

02:24.770 --> 02:29.880
And then let's write continue exploring.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.530
Like so as far as the heading One.

02:32.630 --> 02:36.890
And then within the paragraph let's write paragraph.

02:36.980 --> 02:42.290
Let's also write all the way the class of hero text.

02:42.290 --> 02:48.560
Now let's maybe add another not 12 words or something like that and then we're gonna create our button

02:49.070 --> 02:52.840
now our button is also gonna be a link.

02:53.180 --> 02:56.840
So right after the paragraph I'm gonna create a link.

02:56.840 --> 03:07.100
Now the draft is going to be hashtag towards so later on we're going to create a div or section with

03:07.100 --> 03:08.130
an idea of doors.

03:08.300 --> 03:14.090
And you know what I believe in fact it's not gonna be tours it's gonna be featured.

03:14.630 --> 03:23.390
And then as far as styling for the link Well we're gonna have the class BD n and Beatty and white Beatty

03:23.390 --> 03:24.010
and white.

03:24.450 --> 03:31.880
And as a side note the beat and white is going to be in fact our global styles because there's also

03:31.880 --> 03:38.480
gonna be a not only beat in white so button white but we're also gonna have the primary button.

03:38.480 --> 03:41.220
So there's gonna be some styles that both of them share.

03:41.450 --> 03:47.860
But let's say for example color is gonna be separate for each of the buttons.

03:47.990 --> 03:54.410
So we're gonna have some global styling for the button white as well as for the button primary.

03:54.620 --> 04:01.790
And let's write some text explore talks and yep we do have our link.

04:01.800 --> 04:07.320
However we haven't added any styling yet so this is exactly what we're gonna do next.
