00:00.330 --> 00:07.140
Next one up we have descendant and child combat centers and probably the toughest part he is going to

00:07.140 --> 00:08.070
be for you listening.

00:08.070 --> 00:14.790
How I struggle with a descendant name and everything else is gonna be very straightforward where children

00:14.850 --> 00:21.330
can be descendants but descendants are not going to be children and I know it might be confusing a little

00:21.330 --> 00:25.100
bit right now but I think with an example this is all going to make sense.

00:25.110 --> 00:30.330
So what I would like right now is head over back to my HMO and within the age the amount we're gonna

00:30.360 --> 00:31.290
create some days.

00:31.710 --> 00:36.230
So let's say first of all all these suckers are going to go because that was the last video.

00:36.420 --> 00:41.910
And then within the next day you know we all gonna do a little bit of cleanup and let's say there's

00:41.910 --> 00:47.060
gonna be Dave and Laura with the Dave I would like to add some class some let's say that there's gonna

00:47.070 --> 00:52.510
be a head or class on Dave and within Dave let's place and I'm not having one.

00:52.560 --> 00:57.420
We're all gonna say I am child and descendant.

00:57.450 --> 01:04.620
And like I said watching me struggle with the name as well as the spelling is probably gonna be very

01:04.620 --> 01:05.400
funny.

01:05.400 --> 01:11.940
Hopefully this is correct descendant and then we're looking for another Dave and then we didn't this

01:11.940 --> 01:13.620
Dave again we're gonna do the same thing.

01:14.130 --> 01:20.960
We're gonna have the class of this is gonna be better and for some reason I wrote stay here dear which

01:20.970 --> 01:22.390
is not what I wanted.

01:22.470 --> 01:28.930
And let's add on another unordered list within the on our list there's gonna be a list item and here

01:28.930 --> 01:34.760
we're gonna say heading one where this is gonna be this and that and hopefully I'm spelling correctly.

01:34.950 --> 01:37.080
And now this is gonna be my last item.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.190
Now where do those selectors come in play.

01:40.040 --> 01:45.700
Well let's say if I'm going to write very generic I'm gonna say Dave and let me delete this.

01:45.710 --> 01:49.540
Let's say Dave and I'm not there Dave.

01:49.550 --> 01:55.880
So finally Dave and if I would want to select all the heading ones that are within Dave's I can just

01:55.880 --> 01:59.240
create a space and now I'm looking for my descendant.

01:59.300 --> 02:05.150
So everything that is gonna be as an ancestor where Dave is gonna be ancestor for setting one this is

02:05.150 --> 02:11.600
gonna qualify as well as this guy's gonna qualify because both of them are descendants from Dave and

02:11.600 --> 02:17.590
simple enough we can just say I don't know what color he is gonna be right now what happened.

02:17.660 --> 02:19.820
Both of them turn color red.

02:19.820 --> 02:24.170
Now the reason why this dad is not here actually because this is sitting within the list item.

02:24.260 --> 02:25.480
So don't get confused.

02:25.490 --> 02:28.120
We're just talking about the heading ones right now.

02:28.130 --> 02:30.970
However we also have an option of children.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.930
So if I would one just select the direct children of the Dave.

02:35.330 --> 02:37.080
Well the syntax would be like this.

02:37.100 --> 02:43.680
So in this case we have the space then we're looking for the angle bracket and then we're going to write

02:43.680 --> 02:44.510
having one.

02:44.510 --> 02:48.650
So in this case with the right color and in our case it's going to be blue.

02:48.740 --> 02:54.650
So if I'm going to change this and if I'm going to say the only heading ones there are direct children

02:54.710 --> 02:59.860
of the div because you notice right now I have the day off but then I have the honor list and then list

02:59.870 --> 03:00.530
item.

03:00.530 --> 03:03.360
So I'll direct parent would be the list item.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.530
In this case there's not gonna be the actual div.

03:06.590 --> 03:10.450
So that is the reason why all of them have been selected with red.

03:10.460 --> 03:15.970
But then if you're adding the child then obviously only that direct child is gonna be styled.

03:16.070 --> 03:18.570
We're not limited to using the elements selectors here.

03:18.590 --> 03:23.150
We could use the class that was the reason why we added the class when I said header.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.690
And again let's say I'm gonna be selecting all the heading ones.

03:26.810 --> 03:32.960
Same thing again I'm just looking for descendants and we're going to say color here and the color is

03:32.960 --> 03:34.040
gonna be green.

03:34.040 --> 03:37.960
Now what's also happening is that this is gonna be more specific.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.270
Now you might argue with me you can say Well yeah just because you wrote it as a last draw.

03:43.330 --> 03:43.710
Okay.

03:43.730 --> 03:44.550
Let's start out.

03:44.570 --> 03:45.920
Let's put it on top.

03:46.070 --> 03:47.780
And once we say what happened.

03:47.780 --> 03:49.360
Still everything is green.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.270
And the reason for that.

03:50.270 --> 03:56.630
Again I use the descendants selector so all the heading ones within the class of header and we can use

03:56.630 --> 03:59.060
the idea here we can use anything we would want.

03:59.060 --> 04:05.030
Again we're just looking for descendants select and however though this is more specific.

04:05.060 --> 04:10.510
So even though we wrote this on a top and then we added two more rows directly looking for the class

04:10.510 --> 04:13.640
is more specific and that's the reason why we're overwriting this.

04:13.710 --> 04:18.790
That's something to keep in mind that the specificity is going to matter.

04:18.830 --> 04:19.830
Now I also can do.

04:19.840 --> 04:23.700
That's a header and then I can look for the like child.

04:23.700 --> 04:29.120
So in this case maybe let's say for the heading ones there are direct children of the class of header

04:29.530 --> 04:31.560
are one the colour to be purple.

04:31.650 --> 04:33.280
And what do you think is going to happen.

04:33.290 --> 04:35.540
Well I'm pretty sure only the first one is going to be.

04:36.300 --> 04:43.430
And a nutshell this is how we can work descendant and child commentators or selectors in the CSF.
