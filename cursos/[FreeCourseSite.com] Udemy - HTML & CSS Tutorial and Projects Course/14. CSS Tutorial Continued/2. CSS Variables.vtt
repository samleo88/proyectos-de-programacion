00:00.870 --> 00:08.190
Moving on we have seen says variables a.k.a. custom properties and I can tell you right away I really

00:08.190 --> 00:09.830
like it as variables.

00:10.020 --> 00:14.490
I like to use them because they give us a lot of flexibility.

00:14.520 --> 00:20.100
Now the main point behind the variable would be the fact that we can store the variable and then we

00:20.100 --> 00:22.690
can reuse it all throughout the docket.

00:22.710 --> 00:28.110
Not a syntax would be dash dash then the name of the variable and then what kind of value would like

00:28.110 --> 00:29.100
to hold.

00:29.100 --> 00:34.320
And then if would like to use it then we're going to have the property and then again syntax would be

00:34.320 --> 00:34.830
var.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.080
So that is the syntax.

00:36.090 --> 00:37.760
So please don't skip it.

00:37.890 --> 00:42.590
And then here you need to go again with dash dash and the name of that variable.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.610
Now there's gonna be two types of scopes for the variables.

00:45.610 --> 00:49.440
There's gonna be the global one where we can use it all throughout the document.

00:49.560 --> 00:52.710
And now we're going to return back to this selector.

00:52.710 --> 00:57.780
Remember we're talking about pseudo selectors and in that case we're talking about the route where we

00:57.780 --> 00:59.990
actually are selecting the HDMI element.

01:00.390 --> 01:05.030
So that's where we're setting up our variables as well as what we can do it locally.

01:05.040 --> 01:11.760
Just the one element now in our example again we're going to use mostly the actual colors or I think

01:11.760 --> 01:16.920
maybe exclusively colors because they all gonna make more sense but just remember you can use it with

01:16.920 --> 01:19.350
any kind of property and throw out the projects.

01:19.350 --> 01:21.220
This is exactly what we're gonna do.

01:21.420 --> 01:27.560
First things first we're gonna head over back to the normal as always we need something to work with.

01:27.570 --> 01:33.060
So let's say heading and in this case I would like to have the class I'm going to say class and here

01:33.060 --> 01:34.900
I'm gonna use the same hand in class.

01:34.950 --> 01:39.540
Now technically we maybe don't need to even add classes we could have done this with having ones but

01:39.920 --> 01:43.850
you know just because I like adding classes we're just gonna go with classes.

01:44.330 --> 01:44.680
Okay.

01:44.700 --> 01:48.330
First one is gonna be hitting one then we're gonna create another paragraph.

01:48.330 --> 01:51.930
I don't know here the class would be I guess text and let's.

01:52.020 --> 01:56.920
I don't know have some Lorem text I don't know 20 words I think that's gonna be enough.

01:56.970 --> 01:58.080
MARGARET So far so good.

01:58.080 --> 02:01.260
So we have paragraph and one having.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.430
So what's next.

02:02.430 --> 02:08.410
Well now I'd like to create a div where the class of main where I'm gonna have another paragraph.

02:08.530 --> 02:12.880
Now the reason for that is because I would like to show you how we can locally scope this.

02:12.900 --> 02:17.820
So I'm gonna say first that there's going to be div then we didn't they we're gonna have some class

02:18.280 --> 02:23.220
and the class name is gonna be made and within this div there's gonna be another paragraph and again

02:23.220 --> 02:28.480
just because I like adding classes it's a class and this is gonna be equal to the main text.

02:28.920 --> 02:32.670
And again we can do the same spiel where any words please.

02:32.670 --> 02:33.810
Thank you Emmett.

02:33.810 --> 02:39.690
Now moving on after the div there's gonna be two more headings one is gonna be with a class of I don't

02:39.690 --> 02:46.200
know second I think I'm getting this it doesn't really matter what kind of class names you have or you

02:46.200 --> 02:52.140
can select later on with headings with the elements selector but I think I'm just gonna stick with the

02:52.140 --> 02:58.500
actual classes so heading and I can just do it over here like this I can say that first oh yeah this

02:58.500 --> 03:04.200
is gonna be heading then we're gonna copy and paste this so I'm gonna say one more heading three and

03:04.200 --> 03:09.330
let's change the class here again just so you can see actually how this is gonna be happening we're

03:09.330 --> 03:15.630
gonna have third heading now we have the main heading two paragraphs and one of them that is important

03:15.630 --> 03:21.780
sitting within Dave and then we have the another right now if we're heading back to which email or I'm

03:21.780 --> 03:27.630
sorry CSX assess then you know what for the time being I'm just gonna collapse this just so we can see

03:27.630 --> 03:33.330
a little bit better what we're doing and then let's start by selecting the colors because that's usually

03:33.330 --> 03:38.440
is is gonna be something we're gonna lose you see us as variables we're let's say that you found one

03:38.500 --> 03:46.740
for the heading some kind of color and I'm going to say color hashtag EF 1 5 0 2 4 so that's gonna be

03:46.740 --> 03:53.550
my orange color so far so good then also I have an option of using the text remember that was the paragraph

03:54.060 --> 04:03.570
I'm gonna I'm gonna have the color hashtag three to f f and zero g and that was the green color and

04:03.570 --> 04:05.870
I would like to also have the four main text.

04:06.060 --> 04:16.680
So for this guy we're going gonna say main text and then I don't know we can use color hashtag 1 3 1

04:16.680 --> 04:18.570
3 NFA.

04:18.820 --> 04:20.470
So I have three colors.

04:20.660 --> 04:24.770
Now what happens if I want let's say color for a second heading.

04:25.020 --> 04:30.690
Well you can say you have many options you can either included here with the heading One or you can

04:30.690 --> 04:33.910
just reuse the color again really pick and choose.

04:33.940 --> 04:40.290
No Okay I'll listen to your advice and I'm gonna say second heading and I would like to reuse one of

04:40.290 --> 04:41.150
these colors.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.430
No let's say this is gonna be this orange one.

04:43.940 --> 04:47.940
So I cannot again type color or we obviously could have copy and paste it.

04:47.970 --> 04:55.910
There's no big deal but since I really like typing zero point you far knock what happens later on let's

04:55.920 --> 05:03.210
say a simple example that I change my color I say you know what I really don't like this orange one

05:03.330 --> 05:06.040
I would like to have some kind of color okay.

05:06.050 --> 05:07.830
I mean it's easy I can just change it right.

05:07.830 --> 05:13.980
You can say well change the I don't know variables say thirty nine and hopefully this is gonna be better.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.230
So now we're having a darker orange color.

05:17.320 --> 05:22.620
Okay but what happens when all the instances of this color now in this case obviously we have only two

05:22.620 --> 05:27.900
of them we have the heading and the second heading what is gonna happen if you're going to have a five

05:27.900 --> 05:28.940
page website.

05:29.100 --> 05:35.310
Are you really gonna jump through every instance where you have the color and changes color because

05:35.310 --> 05:41.490
it might be a little bit annoying or okay you don't have this case but you have another case where by

05:41.490 --> 05:43.130
mistake you type like this.

05:43.130 --> 05:47.760
You were typing you were busy you were watching TV or something and then it doesn't even match your

05:47.760 --> 05:48.890
original color.

05:48.930 --> 05:52.420
Another mistake or you know what to do.

05:52.420 --> 05:58.380
So what would be solution and this is where they see us as the variables come into help where we have

05:58.380 --> 06:04.230
a way of storing these values and then I can just reuse them all throughout my document and they're

06:04.230 --> 06:08.290
all gonna be stored in one place so there's not going to be any typos.

06:08.310 --> 06:15.420
That's number one and number two the moment I'm going to change it in my main setting whatever I'm storing

06:15.420 --> 06:20.130
these values they're all going to be change all throughout my document don't believe me.

06:20.130 --> 06:20.990
Let me show you.

06:21.050 --> 06:28.130
And for this you know what I will gonna do a little bit more of actually commenting out because again

06:28.170 --> 06:30.440
I don't want this to get in our way.

06:30.570 --> 06:31.530
So I'm gonna save this.

06:31.530 --> 06:34.500
I mean we already have covered this technically again.

06:34.510 --> 06:37.080
There's no real point of saving these colors.

06:37.080 --> 06:42.220
We have color the hex values just in case so you have everything that we're doing in a lecture.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.280
I'm just gonna keep this in the comments.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.830
However I will not collapse this because I think this is gonna be easier for us to work.

06:49.110 --> 06:52.500
Like I said there's gonna be two places where we can store these values.

06:52.590 --> 06:58.240
One is gonna be locally for some kind of element and the second one is gonna be global.

06:58.290 --> 07:02.480
Now the global one is gonna make sure that we can access it everywhere.

07:02.580 --> 07:04.960
And again we all gonna be going back to the room.

07:05.130 --> 07:08.220
Now if you remember the road was selecting the HDMI home.

07:08.700 --> 07:12.490
So saying whatever I'm doing right now is I'm working with HDMI out.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.420
And in this case I would like to start with declaring a variable.

07:16.520 --> 07:24.000
So I'm going to say primary color and again name this whatever you want the media the orange the Chicagos

07:24.000 --> 07:24.440
the.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.310
Again it doesn't really matter.

07:26.310 --> 07:30.840
Are you gonna name something relay related to the color if you're storing the call value.

07:30.870 --> 07:31.770
Probably.

07:31.830 --> 07:37.710
I mean unless you really are a rebel or something you are going to use something that relates to the

07:37.710 --> 07:39.380
value that are going to be holding.

07:39.390 --> 07:45.690
So in my case I'm gonna say primary color and then I would say that I would want to store EF 1 5 0 2

07:45.690 --> 07:46.500
4.

07:46.530 --> 07:49.220
Now the key here is I can reuse where I would like.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.200
So again I can say heading.

07:51.360 --> 07:57.630
And in this case again we're going to use the color property but this is where that change happens because

07:57.630 --> 08:03.840
instead of using this value I can save are gone that was this index to the ashes and then I'm going

08:03.840 --> 08:05.100
for my variable.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.960
Now at the moment we have only one variable.

08:07.260 --> 08:09.040
So it's kind of hard to mess it up.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.770
But in general we're gonna have five six seven 10.

08:11.770 --> 08:12.960
It doesn't really matter.

08:12.960 --> 08:13.780
Now check this out.

08:14.310 --> 08:20.220
I have access to this color so if I would one for the second heading no problem just get the same thing

08:20.590 --> 08:26.580
so I can say like this I can copy and paste it and I believe the class name is second heading correct

08:26.580 --> 08:27.770
me if I'm wrong.

08:27.870 --> 08:29.840
Second heading what do you see here.

08:29.970 --> 08:32.960
And I see this orange color you don't like the orange color.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.310
No problem.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.220
Delete this.

08:35.220 --> 08:42.530
Let's say this is gonna be hashtag 1 3 1 3 F.A. so all my headings are blue.

08:42.660 --> 08:49.170
I hope you already see how much more beneficial this is than copying pasting each and every line that

08:49.170 --> 08:50.460
you're working.

08:50.580 --> 08:56.520
It might seem like no big deal to copy pasted first five times has been working with these silly examples

08:56.970 --> 09:01.350
but the moment you're gonna start doing some kind of relevant work you can appreciate.

09:01.380 --> 09:04.500
Yes those variables are a lot and I mean it's a lot.

09:04.790 --> 09:05.400
OK.

09:05.550 --> 09:07.570
Now we have this current one covered.

09:07.680 --> 09:12.420
What about if we create another color and let's say I don't know.

09:12.420 --> 09:13.380
Or you know what.

09:13.380 --> 09:14.730
Let me show you another property.

09:14.730 --> 09:18.750
So since we have been covering everything here with the colors why don't we create another one Why don't

09:18.750 --> 09:24.110
we say main transition because like I said we can store anything we would like here.

09:24.180 --> 09:30.030
We already have covered transition so we should be very similar to the shorthand where we have the all.

09:30.030 --> 09:32.030
So this would be all the properties.

09:32.040 --> 09:38.430
And I'm gonna say zero point three or four seconds and then the transition is gonna have the transition

09:38.430 --> 09:43.010
function of linear so transition is gonna happen linearly now okay.

09:43.230 --> 09:46.140
And what I would like right now is for the second heading.

09:46.460 --> 09:51.670
And that's gonna be my element as I'm hovering I would like to have the different color.

09:51.900 --> 09:52.440
And you know what.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.070
Let's add a different color also.

09:55.170 --> 10:02.910
This would be let's say primary and we're gonna have another variable secondary color and this is gonna

10:02.910 --> 10:03.660
be orange.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.290
So again let's say F 1 5 0 2 4.

10:06.690 --> 10:12.540
I know I deleted it and now I'm adding it again my apologies but I just wanted to show you the blue

10:12.540 --> 10:15.200
one and then got carried away deleted.

10:15.210 --> 10:15.880
Now it's back.

10:16.380 --> 10:19.590
Okay now as I'm hovering I would like to change the color.

10:19.830 --> 10:25.020
And again I can use the VAR since this is globally I can access this anywhere I can ask is that in this

10:25.020 --> 10:27.570
paragraph in that paragraph doesn't really matter.

10:27.570 --> 10:34.140
Now I'm showing the heading but hopefully you understand the secondary color here I come as I'm hovering

10:34.290 --> 10:35.540
this is gonna be the color.

10:35.620 --> 10:40.630
Now also at the moment there's no transition as I'm hovering it happens instantly.

10:40.650 --> 10:41.490
Well I don't want that.

10:41.520 --> 10:46.210
So I can say transition again and then I'm going to be looking for what.

10:46.220 --> 10:50.040
Well you are getting the syntax and main transition.

10:50.040 --> 10:54.600
What's really cool again and I can add this transition if let's say I set for all of them zero point

10:54.600 --> 11:00.660
four I can use this all throughout the document everywhere I would like one zero point five.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.090
Later on you can add zero point five later on.

11:03.390 --> 11:08.160
Obviously if you want to have some kind of unique transitions you wouldn't want to do this but in my

11:08.160 --> 11:13.770
case I usually prefer just to stick with one transition unless there's really really something major

11:14.130 --> 11:15.350
that I would like to change.

11:15.390 --> 11:19.110
I mean not for every project but in general terms.

11:19.110 --> 11:24.150
So let's say as you can see again the transition is happening so everything is working.

11:24.510 --> 11:29.850
So we have successfully created the variables and we know how we can reuse them.

11:29.850 --> 11:34.580
Now let's look with the local scope because so far we are just working with the main scope.

11:34.710 --> 11:40.080
And again I'm not going to show you the example but we could access this year with the paragraph we

11:40.080 --> 11:45.090
could access this in the text because the reason for that because we set up the route and the route

11:45.120 --> 11:48.190
right now has these variables help you understand.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.440
What about the local one.

11:50.550 --> 11:56.100
Well the local let's say paragraph right now is sitting where this is sitting in a div I can target

11:56.100 --> 11:56.850
the class.

11:56.850 --> 12:02.350
This is gonna work exactly the same but I'm going to say it for div because I got this maybe it's gonna

12:02.370 --> 12:07.740
be a little bit easier to understand but we could have used the class and in this case I'm going to

12:07.740 --> 12:15.030
say primary primary read more you know just write like this primary red color and I'm going to set this

12:15.030 --> 12:20.220
equal just to simple red color I could have used the hash value doesn't really matter but in my case

12:20.220 --> 12:21.720
I'm gonna say the simple red color.

12:22.240 --> 12:27.800
Okay what is within the div if I remember correctly within the day we have main text.

12:27.990 --> 12:34.860
Okay so class name may text you go color is gonna be what.

12:34.890 --> 12:37.770
Well I can use again the variable name right.

12:37.800 --> 12:46.760
So are these index dash dash primary red and you are also right away saw two options so I could have

12:47.040 --> 12:55.140
used you see the primary or secondary and I also could use this primer at the moment we save it sure

12:55.140 --> 12:57.480
enough no questions asked.

12:57.660 --> 13:04.320
We're having this paragraph right Okay what about can we access these values somewhere else.

13:04.520 --> 13:09.930
So let's say we are trying to access this another heading the one that's all the way in the bottom where

13:09.930 --> 13:17.720
the class of third any I mean we can always test it out we can say third thing it's gonna be the name

13:18.110 --> 13:23.890
and for this setting I would like to access again the color as well as I would like to access LA and

13:23.930 --> 13:30.970
let's try for primary red and let's see whether this is gonna work out and I moment i it nothing changes

13:31.250 --> 13:32.440
mm mm hmm.

13:32.480 --> 13:37.790
Does that mean this is gonna be local as com has always we can head over to our developer tools and

13:37.790 --> 13:45.260
say inspect and we'll be able to see what's happening with inheritance so this is gonna be my body now

13:45.260 --> 13:50.720
what happens on my heading one as I'm looking over it well I see here that I'm using the primary color

13:50.720 --> 13:56.990
and all that but notice what's telling you inherited information AML inherited what.

13:57.200 --> 14:01.970
Well we inherited that colors one color transition so far so good.

14:02.030 --> 14:07.170
Now what happens with this guy with the one that's sitting within the main that we see here.

14:07.250 --> 14:10.400
So we have a paragraph so what paragraph is inheriting.

14:10.400 --> 14:16.370
Well it's inheriting two things it's inheriting from the day of the primary red so we can re reuse it

14:16.730 --> 14:22.790
everywhere within this day and obviously since we set it up in our CEO says with a div understand that

14:22.970 --> 14:26.320
I can add as many divs and this is gonna be scoped to those diff.

14:26.390 --> 14:31.590
So this is just the way normal as this would work but it also has access to these values.

14:31.790 --> 14:36.230
So if you want locally scoped you can create some kind of variables.

14:36.350 --> 14:42.230
In most cases though I'm not a fortune teller but I would assume that you're gonna be probably setting

14:42.230 --> 14:44.140
up everything globally within the rules.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.600
And then just reusing these variables all throughout your project.
