WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:03.760
And once we are in our success we can start styling.

00:04.050 --> 00:11.400
So we're here to say this is going to be contact here and then we're going to say padding 40 pixels

00:11.720 --> 00:12.720
all around.

00:12.960 --> 00:23.310
They're going to have a background here and this is going to be to be here 9 8 EF 0 right here and then

00:23.350 --> 00:28.540
we're going to have a color of here hash tag 5 5 5 right.

00:28.760 --> 00:37.230
Then we would want to start with on their lines are going to say stack contact here and know and underline

00:38.220 --> 00:43.350
how are you going to see a border water color.

00:43.450 --> 00:43.920
Right.

00:44.170 --> 00:49.100
And this is going to be hash tag a 5 5 5 on this.

00:49.390 --> 00:55.380
Then after that what you want to do is actually have an item.

00:55.890 --> 00:59.670
I had them here in the fall.

00:59.720 --> 01:05.830
We're here and we're going to say all here like this display we're here and flex and what I'm talking

01:05.830 --> 01:07.700
about over here is these guys right.

01:07.720 --> 01:11.000
So you hear see or hear someone see text All right.

01:11.060 --> 01:13.810
So one font or some one side and text on the other.

01:13.810 --> 01:20.270
Right so one of them side by side so I'm going to say flux over here then I'm going to say margin and

01:20.260 --> 01:29.560
I'm going to say 20 pixels here zero using this and font size and this is going to be 30 pixels on here

01:29.560 --> 01:30.130
like this.

01:30.140 --> 01:32.290
All right so both of them 30 pixels.

01:32.590 --> 01:42.230
Then what we're going to have is I had some info here and fantastic on this and we're going to say margin.

01:42.550 --> 01:43.460
I'm going to say right.

01:43.480 --> 01:45.780
Twenty pixels are here.

01:45.780 --> 01:51.760
All right so now we got our little space over here then we're going to have a form foot so I'm going

01:51.760 --> 01:59.750
to save room and put more here and then I'm going to save display display block on here and this.

01:59.770 --> 02:04.170
Right now you can see how they're displaying instead of in line now they are on display.

02:04.210 --> 02:09.830
Block with you going right away say hundred percent here.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.470
Now they're spanning all across the screen.

02:12.530 --> 02:13.100
Right.

02:13.420 --> 02:17.870
And then after that we're going to have a margin on the margin we're going to say like this.

02:17.870 --> 02:21.260
This is going to be 10 pixels zero.

02:21.670 --> 02:27.830
We're here then we're going to have a fun size twenty five pixels like this.

02:27.830 --> 02:34.130
All right so font sizes got bigger then you are going to have a panning 10 pixels over here.

02:34.370 --> 02:44.870
Then we're going to have a background transparent on this and then we're going to have a border and

02:45.110 --> 02:46.770
we're going to say none.

02:46.770 --> 02:50.110
All right so we're going to we want to get rid of these borders all around.

02:50.410 --> 02:51.970
So none more here.

02:52.030 --> 03:01.660
However what we would want or we're all going to say border bottom I would say that's safe for pixels

03:02.790 --> 03:11.700
solid solid or here and this is going to be hash tag 5 5 5 1.

03:12.040 --> 03:15.020
And then after that you would want a form input.

03:15.090 --> 03:21.200
So I'm going to go here for and put that on here like this placeholder.

03:21.310 --> 03:23.500
I here we're going to have a color.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.180
So we're going to have color hash tag.

03:25.180 --> 03:27.190
F5 F5 F5.

03:27.210 --> 03:27.790
All right.

03:27.790 --> 03:34.150
So now basically what I'm saying is that I would want for the form input to have a white text over here

03:34.150 --> 03:37.870
instead of that great one right now that we have this.

03:38.040 --> 03:42.040
Let's go ahead and let's actually style this link over here.

03:42.120 --> 03:42.760
Right.

03:43.020 --> 03:51.540
So we're here we're going to say this is going to be a customer here in full.

03:51.830 --> 03:59.170
And first of all them to say this play and we're going to say this play block and I can see that it's

03:59.200 --> 04:05.710
spanning all across that we're going to have a padding 20 pixels here like this.

04:05.720 --> 04:09.180
They're going to have a margin on here top.

04:09.180 --> 04:15.640
I'm going to say 30 pixels or pixels or here text decoration.

04:16.170 --> 04:18.080
None here.

04:18.200 --> 04:23.740
They all going to have a font size 30 pixels on here like this.

04:23.930 --> 04:30.590
We're going to have over here a margin for the actual war here for these guys right.

04:30.630 --> 04:34.970
So we need to figure out how we would actually separate them right here.

04:34.990 --> 04:42.640
One of the ways we can do is actually display flex on here and we can just say justify content and we

04:42.680 --> 04:45.610
can just say all of this right.

04:45.630 --> 04:48.040
So they're evenly distributed.

04:48.050 --> 04:54.960
They're going to say a color five five a five year background.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.820
Hash tag 1 9 1 9 1 9.

04:58.230 --> 05:02.040
You know this area and we're going to have a transition.

05:02.190 --> 05:05.990
This is going to be background on here.

05:06.000 --> 05:13.280
Two seconds is easily here and then we're going to have a hovering effect.

05:13.290 --> 05:13.980
Right.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.660
So this is going to be customer

05:18.250 --> 05:19.140
here.

05:19.250 --> 05:20.710
This is going to be info.

05:21.080 --> 05:24.300
We're going to have a this is going to be however.

05:24.680 --> 05:33.380
And then we're going to have a background it's going to be a hashtag in 1999 would be like this.

05:33.380 --> 05:38.650
So basically as I'm hollering this is going to change and I can see that it actually turns gray.

05:38.930 --> 05:43.420
And now that we're done with this the last thing that we need to do is we need to make this responsive.
