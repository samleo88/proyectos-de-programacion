WEBVTT

00:00.760 --> 00:01.270
All right.

00:01.290 --> 00:04.890
We have one bad boy left which would be background attachment.

00:05.260 --> 00:09.700
But for the background attachment we're going to do a little bit more realistic example.

00:09.910 --> 00:15.430
First things first we would like to get rid of the height as it is right now with 400 pixels and we're

00:15.430 --> 00:17.110
gonna say mean height instead.

00:17.120 --> 00:23.200
So this would probably make sure that even though the content of our div is not let's say big enough

00:23.250 --> 00:28.990
100 percent do you hide it always is gonna be at least minimal height of hundred percent.

00:29.290 --> 00:35.350
And can say here view height and as well as always you don't have to just use this in view height.

00:35.380 --> 00:39.490
I'm just setting up this with the view height you can use this with the pixels as well.

00:39.790 --> 00:45.010
That would be the first thing that we're gonna get rid of let's say color red and we're gonna add some

00:45.010 --> 00:52.120
green one then to say that the colors can be green can also add right away some font size of let's say

00:52.120 --> 00:53.210
60 pixels.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.310
And now I'd like to place this text in a center.

00:56.320 --> 01:01.930
Now we haven't covered this yet we haven't covered the Flex box but we we're gonna use it quickly again

01:02.070 --> 01:04.070
don't please hang up on this.

01:04.180 --> 01:07.120
We're going to cover all these properties later on with the values.

01:07.120 --> 01:10.870
So for now just type with me and we're going to place the text in the center.

01:10.960 --> 01:15.100
So I'm gonna say first display is going to be equal to flex.

01:15.100 --> 01:18.910
Then we would like to justify content in horizontally.

01:18.910 --> 01:27.060
So we're gonna write center and a line items also in the center that would work and this is gonna place

01:27.060 --> 01:29.350
it exactly in the center.

01:29.420 --> 01:32.430
I would probably still want to add the text in the center as well.

01:32.470 --> 01:36.690
So I'm going to text a line and text the line is gonna be in the center.

01:36.690 --> 01:42.480
There is a little bit of margins and patterns that we're getting so maybe why don't we do a quick reset

01:42.510 --> 01:45.280
or preset where we are just margin.

01:45.270 --> 01:46.500
It is gonna be zero.

01:46.500 --> 01:52.710
Now we have already covered these properties with values padding is also gonna be set to zero and box

01:52.710 --> 01:56.220
sizing is gonna be set to board a box.

01:56.310 --> 02:04.140
Mark sizing motorbikes once we say it we have three big containers each of them having a hundred percent

02:04.170 --> 02:04.940
of the year.

02:05.280 --> 02:09.040
Since we already have covered the view height items.

02:09.060 --> 02:10.530
Okay what's next.

02:10.530 --> 02:14.380
Well we have the background attachment now for the background attachment.

02:14.430 --> 02:18.990
Let's maybe also change some few things around because it's going to be much more easier to see once

02:18.990 --> 02:23.370
we have the big images and hear the changes that are gonna be very simple.

02:23.370 --> 02:30.150
How would you like to have the big J pack for the third guy for the folder image and for the small one

02:30.160 --> 02:33.680
I'm gonna change this one to the folder image so I'm gonna stay here like this.

02:33.680 --> 02:39.730
So I would cover this line of code and I'm gonna basically cut it out copy and paste it right here.

02:39.810 --> 02:45.780
So I'm now going to have my second one and then for the third one I'm also gonna get the big JPEG so

02:45.780 --> 02:51.540
I'm going to copy this one and you're not gonna copy and paste it here for a background image.

02:51.540 --> 02:57.190
Now what else we're gonna do well we're gonna have the background size set to cover.

02:57.390 --> 03:01.900
Then we're gonna get rid of the repetition and position.

03:02.010 --> 03:08.100
So I'm gonna say these guys are not going to matter when I say background and we're gonna have size

03:08.710 --> 03:10.700
is gonna be for all of them cover.

03:10.920 --> 03:11.520
And you know what.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.890
We can maybe add also.

03:13.050 --> 03:14.040
No repeat.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.070
So let's do like this.

03:15.210 --> 03:18.270
Let's copy and paste in let's uh.

03:18.290 --> 03:18.960
Right here.

03:18.980 --> 03:20.290
No repeat.

03:20.390 --> 03:22.640
And here this is gonna be no repeat.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.280
So all three of them are gonna be exactly the same.

03:25.760 --> 03:26.710
And you know what.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.650
What else we can do what position we can maybe add center.

03:29.710 --> 03:36.440
So let's say background position position is gonna be in the center for all the images and you know

03:36.440 --> 03:36.730
what.

03:36.740 --> 03:40.360
Again let's do the same thing where you can just copy paste them.

03:40.490 --> 03:45.960
I'm going to copy paste them now for all my whatever the banners that I have right now.

03:45.980 --> 03:47.980
The position is gonna be in the center.

03:48.050 --> 03:53.090
Now where does the background attachment comes in as I'm scrolling I can see that I have three massive

03:53.090 --> 03:59.330
images and we can see it actually better on a bigger screen where we have the I am big image I am the

03:59.330 --> 04:05.750
small image and I am the folder image all of them are big banners that we are all going to later on

04:05.750 --> 04:08.000
use usually for our site.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.160
The moment we load this isn't gonna be the big image that we're all going to be loading as a background

04:12.160 --> 04:12.370
name.

04:13.010 --> 04:16.980
However we have an option of setting the background attachment.

04:17.180 --> 04:18.950
How is background attachment gonna do.

04:18.950 --> 04:20.470
Well let's figure out.

04:20.470 --> 04:23.690
So for the middle one because it's gonna be easier to see in the beginning.

04:23.850 --> 04:28.540
We can just write background and then we have an option of background attachment.

04:28.550 --> 04:31.550
So here we have the scroll and the fixed.

04:31.700 --> 04:32.810
So that's what we're looking for.

04:33.230 --> 04:40.700
Well the first one is gonna make sure the background image stays fixed while the text is still moving.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.340
You want to see that here.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.830
This would be one that doesn't have the fixed.

04:44.930 --> 04:46.640
And as I'm scrolling down.

04:46.760 --> 04:47.590
Check this out.

04:47.600 --> 04:52.830
So the second one is gonna have the scroll effect whereas we're moving up and down.

04:52.940 --> 04:59.510
We're having this parallax effect where the text is moving but the image stays actually fit because

04:59.720 --> 05:03.140
the background attachment property has been set to fixed.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.250
We can do the same thing for all of them.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.090
Now that we know how this is gonna work.

05:07.100 --> 05:11.020
So again let me select a line then copy and paste it.

05:11.030 --> 05:16.820
We would want to copy and paste it to the first one as well as to the third one not all of them are

05:16.820 --> 05:17.430
gonna have it.

05:17.450 --> 05:18.980
And now again we can check it out.

05:19.010 --> 05:21.530
Now this is gonna be for all of them.

05:21.590 --> 05:26.310
What are we up and down and the background attachment is gonna be fixed.

05:26.450 --> 05:31.270
Again this is gonna be something that we're gonna be using whenever we're going to load the page.

05:31.270 --> 05:36.590
There's gonna be big banner image and as I was crawling up and down the actual property is gonna be

05:36.590 --> 05:37.890
set to fixed.

05:37.910 --> 05:43.040
And as a result will be having this parallax effect where the text is gonna be moving.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.740
However the background image here is gonna stay fixed.
