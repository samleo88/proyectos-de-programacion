WEBVTT

00:00.110 --> 00:06.270
So let's go to Mayne's here says let's open the main thesis and are here you can see that we have the

00:06.270 --> 00:07.260
body.

00:07.290 --> 00:12.420
Now what I'm going to do here I'm going to create a comment and then I'm going to say that this is going

00:12.420 --> 00:16.200
to be a light blue light blue.

00:16.410 --> 00:20.000
And this is going to be discovered that we're mostly going to be using.

00:20.050 --> 00:23.160
So this or is going to be to be going right.

00:23.160 --> 00:28.500
This is going to be 9 8 and we're going to have 0 3.

00:28.650 --> 00:34.890
So now when we have this color right just because it's easier for us to actually remember this one right.

00:34.890 --> 00:36.640
And then we don't need to look for it.

00:36.660 --> 00:39.740
If we ever let's say fun forget it or something like that.

00:39.750 --> 00:40.510
Right.

00:40.560 --> 00:45.180
And then the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to select all the elements here and this.

00:45.180 --> 00:50.700
So now we're selecting all the elements and we're going to say for all of them we're going to have a

00:50.780 --> 00:56.240
padding zero then on here we're going to have a margin zero.

00:56.310 --> 00:59.480
And I can see that all the default margins are gone.

00:59.850 --> 01:06.780
Then after that we're going to see a box sizing box over here and we're going to say board box.

01:07.050 --> 01:14.250
Basically what this means is then as we're changing something actually the value on the outside of our

01:14.250 --> 01:18.000
box right of mine is not going to change it's going to go anywhere.

01:18.240 --> 01:24.410
So basically if we change anything with an element it's not going to affect or lay out the actual element

01:24.410 --> 01:26.490
it's just going to change.

01:26.650 --> 01:33.450
Then after that once we have a body here for the whole body we're going to give it a little bit background.

01:33.630 --> 01:37.610
So we're going to see the background and the backgrounds are going to be hash tag.

01:37.880 --> 01:41.220
I have five five and they're fine.

01:41.550 --> 01:45.450
So you could see that this is going to be grayish color.

01:45.650 --> 01:51.780
All right so if we go back to get it you can see this is going to be a local color and with RGV this

01:51.780 --> 01:53.850
is going to be 2:45 here.

01:53.900 --> 01:54.360
Right.

01:54.550 --> 02:02.790
And if you remember that we when we were working actually with a R.G. right 2:55 was the max that was

02:02.790 --> 02:03.420
the white one.

02:03.420 --> 02:06.730
So you can see that it's almost white but it's still gray.

02:06.960 --> 02:12.280
So here now that we have a color and actually switch back to the right.

02:12.390 --> 02:16.190
Not that there is any reason for it but I just like the hex values better.

02:16.350 --> 02:21.750
And after that we would want actually right away set up this flex thing.

02:21.750 --> 02:22.290
Right.

02:22.320 --> 02:28.500
So what we would want to do is actually have a nav bar to be all the way down the top.

02:28.530 --> 02:32.880
However the rest of the space we would want Actually this banner.

02:33.090 --> 02:34.970
And let me show you what I mean by that.

02:35.190 --> 02:38.300
So here first thing that I'm going to say for the whole there.

02:38.430 --> 02:41.660
Right so now I'm talking about all these elements in here.

02:41.690 --> 02:43.690
We're in the header right.

02:43.740 --> 02:46.450
You can see it over here actually in an index right.

02:46.620 --> 02:48.390
So you can see this is going to be the header.

02:48.390 --> 02:51.870
This is going to be our name named main guy.

02:51.930 --> 02:52.350
Right.

02:52.350 --> 02:53.660
This is going to be harder.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.030
So I'm going to go here.

02:55.070 --> 03:00.960
We're going to say for the Henare we would want a display with a Cephalexin we're here.

03:01.070 --> 03:07.900
I'm going to say a flex direction and I'm going to say call right and I can see that they go back over

03:07.910 --> 03:13.980
here to original size then over here we're going to say that we would want a mean height for Heather

03:14.400 --> 03:16.020
to be you know what we would want.

03:16.020 --> 03:19.290
Hey hundred you worked on here like this.

03:19.410 --> 03:22.430
And then after that we have actually two things right.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.200
First we have the novel here so we're going to say now.

03:25.390 --> 03:26.910
And we're going to say that.

03:27.270 --> 03:33.230
It's going to have a flex in this zero zero nada.

03:33.540 --> 03:37.060
Basically what we're saying is we don't want it to grow.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.870
We don't want to actually for it to shrink more here right.

03:40.940 --> 03:43.950
And the set up is going to be R-OH wherever we are.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.390
However restyled This is how it's going to be.

03:46.440 --> 03:52.420
However over here for the banner we're going to say banner we're here and here we're going to write.

03:52.430 --> 03:54.920
This is going to be flex on here.

03:55.020 --> 04:01.380
And this guy we want actually we would want it to grow then we would want zero here.

04:01.410 --> 04:04.210
Right so we wouldn't want it to shrink.

04:04.470 --> 04:06.550
And then over here again we're going to say our.

04:06.790 --> 04:11.690
And you can see what is going to happen is as we're actually changing these values right.

04:11.790 --> 04:16.710
You can see that they're going to change now to actually test it out whether this actually worked.

04:16.920 --> 04:23.050
Let's go ahead and get a background on here we're going to say background blue moon here.

04:23.230 --> 04:23.600
Right.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.010
This is going to be here now.

04:25.260 --> 04:30.570
And over here we're going to say that this is going to be let's say a background and we're going to

04:30.570 --> 04:31.220
see red.

04:31.270 --> 04:32.290
All right.

04:32.370 --> 04:34.330
So you can see what happens right.

04:34.380 --> 04:37.760
This guy is going to be whatever we made it out to be.

04:37.910 --> 04:39.420
Here you can see the difference right.

04:39.420 --> 04:40.430
There's number one.

04:40.590 --> 04:44.860
Basically what happens if I change to 0 0 it doesn't grow.

04:45.150 --> 04:47.310
I changed it back to what it actually grows.

04:47.520 --> 04:53.580
And you can see that the whole thing is going to be actual hundred percent right 100 percent of the

04:53.580 --> 04:56.170
view right now.

04:56.300 --> 04:59.890
We can leave these ones over here for now I'll be working with them.

05:00.150 --> 05:01.240
We can see what's happening.

05:01.460 --> 05:03.010
Or we can just get rid of them right.

05:03.020 --> 05:06.800
We understood the idea what's happening so you can just delete them.

05:06.800 --> 05:07.220
Right.

05:07.230 --> 05:12.980
And because we are going to be placing obviously for the banner there's going to be a background now

05:12.980 --> 05:17.430
after that we are done with the knife and the banner we have set them up.

05:17.510 --> 05:20.330
Now would start working on here with this on our list.

05:20.450 --> 05:26.330
So I'm going to say have an on our list or here and we're going to say this is going to be a list style

05:26.330 --> 05:26.750
type.

05:26.750 --> 05:27.560
None.

05:27.650 --> 05:30.280
And now we can see those annoying dots.

05:30.420 --> 05:34.440
But however because we had a margin carrying 2 0.

05:34.550 --> 05:40.640
But in general if we wouldn't want to go over those dots once we create an our list so list of type

05:40.640 --> 05:43.570
is basically going to really get rid of those dots.

05:43.760 --> 05:47.560
Then after that we would want to target these actual links here.

05:47.600 --> 05:53.210
So what we're going to say or hear is we're going to say have you well and lie any more here.

05:53.330 --> 05:58.430
And the first thing that we would want is this play and we're going to say block the reason why displaying

05:58.460 --> 06:01.310
them blocked because they would be all the way right.

06:01.310 --> 06:06.800
So whenever we're actually hovering around the whole screen is going to be one link.

06:07.010 --> 06:11.540
And this is obviously going to be for the small screen right because we're starting mobile first you

06:11.540 --> 06:16.070
can see that with whatever we're doing on here this is going to be for the small screen and then for

06:16.070 --> 06:20.300
the bigger screens we're actually going to add media queries and we're going to set up a little bit

06:20.300 --> 06:22.490
differently than the next.

06:22.640 --> 06:29.260
Well you would want is actually going to go back over here and I'm going to say for the caller and or

06:29.270 --> 06:30.970
here we're going to use that balloon.

06:31.160 --> 06:36.740
So I'm going to say this is going to be to be one here and this is going to be 9:08 this is going to

06:36.740 --> 06:39.530
be EF 0 here.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.790
You can see that we're getting this light blue color.

06:43.010 --> 06:47.990
Then after that we're going to have a background and the background actually is going to be transparent

06:48.620 --> 06:49.460
on here.

06:49.550 --> 06:55.330
So this is going to leave it the way it is for actual background whatever we have for a parent.

06:55.330 --> 07:00.090
And then after that we're going to have a text and we're going to see text decoration.

07:00.080 --> 07:00.910
None.

07:00.950 --> 07:06.190
In order to get those on the lines then we're going to have a padding and pixels.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.210
Right so you can see that we're adding padding all around.

07:09.240 --> 07:09.570
Right.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.360
All of the pixels.

07:11.360 --> 07:17.150
And then we're going to have font size and that's going to be 20 pixels when you're doing this.

07:17.390 --> 07:24.800
Then after that we would want to have a transition and the transition we would want is once we are going

07:24.800 --> 07:28.040
to have actually set up the button for here right.

07:28.280 --> 07:32.620
Once we actually press the button this is going to disappear.

07:32.660 --> 07:33.010
Right.

07:33.050 --> 07:36.320
And appear again and therefore writing transition.

07:36.320 --> 07:40.490
So here what we can do is say here we can actually create the comment right.

07:40.490 --> 07:43.580
So for now it actually doesn't mess up what we're doing.

07:43.580 --> 07:49.670
So I'm going to say transitional here and then I'm going to say this is going to be color 1 second is

07:49.820 --> 07:54.980
right because I want to go over them once we're actually working with them and I'm going to say background

07:55.450 --> 07:55.970
no.

07:55.990 --> 08:00.590
And also I'm going to say one second is and then we're going to have padding.

08:00.920 --> 08:05.950
And this is also going to be one second ease more you're doing this right.

08:05.990 --> 08:07.370
And we come in this way now.

08:07.370 --> 08:13.440
So that's why it's not affecting and then often that we would want to set up actual rules.

08:13.680 --> 08:14.390
Right.

08:14.480 --> 08:20.090
And what I'm saying here that as I'm transitioning these properties should be affected.

08:20.220 --> 08:20.580
Right.

08:20.630 --> 08:23.770
And now I'm going to set up the actual transition.

08:23.810 --> 08:25.970
So I'm going to say have you.

08:25.990 --> 08:32.450
Well hi we're here and I'm going to say and I'm going to say hover right so I'm going to say how were

08:32.900 --> 08:34.050
you doing this.

08:34.190 --> 08:42.740
And then we're going to say this is going to be color and this is going to be a five EF 5 EF 5 or this

08:43.220 --> 08:49.040
and we're going to say parding and we're going to say padding left here and we're going to say this

08:49.040 --> 08:56.300
is going to be padding left of 60 pixels or here and then we're going to have a background and the background

08:56.300 --> 09:06.530
is going to be we're here hash tag to be here 9 8 and we're going to say this is going to be EF 0.

09:06.650 --> 09:07.160
Right.

09:07.220 --> 09:11.760
So we say this now we can go back let's say in on here and comment this one right.

09:11.930 --> 09:13.130
And let's see what happens.

09:13.130 --> 09:13.370
Right.

09:13.370 --> 09:16.660
So we say this one we're here in our main see is this.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.770
And let's see what happens.

09:17.780 --> 09:18.590
Right.

09:18.590 --> 09:23.010
So what's happening as I'm hovering already you can see the three things are changing.

09:23.150 --> 09:29.840
My background my color and my padding on here like this and the way it works is that on here you can

09:29.840 --> 09:35.810
see that I am saying transition then or here I need to write what is going to be transitioned properly

09:36.240 --> 09:41.470
Vienneau I'm going to say how long the transition is going to take this is how it would happen.

09:41.480 --> 09:41.780
Right.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.970
So there's going to be easier or easier now.

09:44.090 --> 09:49.190
So I'm going to mostly I was going to settle with these because I'm just finding that that's the easiest

09:49.580 --> 09:51.830
especially for these examples.

09:51.890 --> 09:55.790
And then after that we have a delay if we want to if we will write another value.

09:55.790 --> 09:56.030
Right.

09:56.030 --> 10:00.920
So I'm going to say let's in one second and this would be delayed but we're not going used to do X for

10:00.940 --> 10:05.850
now so I can just say this when or where and when we're working with transitions.

10:05.850 --> 10:12.720
The key word here is that we need to write the properties are here and then on here we would want to

10:12.720 --> 10:15.150
write the actual properties that would change right.

10:15.390 --> 10:20.040
So if the colors is going to be changing the padding is going to be hard here changing and the background

10:20.070 --> 10:26.240
right here if we had these three properties over here then we also also going to write these three properties

10:26.430 --> 10:30.380
here and then start actually working on here with this guy.

10:30.720 --> 10:37.290
And with this coating or here we're are going to say all here that we would want a Nav. top so we're

10:37.290 --> 10:44.550
going to say hash tag we have top and then we're going to say we would want this display and then this

10:44.670 --> 10:47.930
same display flex or here like this.

10:47.940 --> 10:55.090
Then after that we would want actually a justified content and we're going to say space between all

10:55.590 --> 10:56.200
this.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.630
And then after that we're going to have a party for this.

10:59.660 --> 11:08.060
Now we're going to say padding and this is going to be 20 pixels by 20 pixels by 20 pixels by 10 pixels.

11:08.380 --> 11:09.550
Were here like this.

11:09.570 --> 11:14.420
So this is going to be set up then we're going to start working with this coding thing.

11:14.610 --> 11:22.260
So we're going to say over here that this is going to be a Nav. Top going to say having three on healing

11:22.260 --> 11:27.240
this letter we're going to say font size 30 pixels.

11:27.240 --> 11:32.640
Then after that this is going to be a padding is going to be five pixels and over here and this is going

11:32.640 --> 11:38.730
to be a color and we're going to use the same color so I'm going to go back over here and we're going

11:38.730 --> 11:46.560
to copy and paste this color know this now that we have the color let's do a border and we're going

11:46.560 --> 11:49.630
to say that you know what this is Mr. Palmer.

11:49.930 --> 11:55.690
So what I would want to do is actually cut this here copy and paste it over here back.

11:55.830 --> 12:03.200
And again let's make more room here so you can see better now that we have a heading three color.

12:03.300 --> 12:11.030
Then after that we would want a border and we're going to say all three pixels are here solid and we're

12:11.160 --> 12:14.360
going to leave it the way it is and you can see here with the color right.

12:14.370 --> 12:17.530
We're getting right away this kind of bore.

12:17.700 --> 12:21.200
So obviously food right over here red would be different.

12:21.510 --> 12:26.490
But since we're leaving the way the actual color is right so this is how it's going to be.

12:26.820 --> 12:29.990
And then after that we would want again a transition.

12:30.270 --> 12:37.810
So we're going to see a transition and are all going to say color when you say two seconds he's here

12:37.970 --> 12:41.200
they're all going to have a background also change.

12:41.330 --> 12:42.790
So we're going to say background.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.660
We're going to say two seconds.

12:44.780 --> 12:53.280
He's not going to do a hovering effect so I'm going to say that can have up and we're going to say heading

12:53.280 --> 12:57.790
three however and adding three however and what should happen.

12:58.090 --> 13:03.020
Background first of all should it happen not an attachment but a background.

13:03.240 --> 13:08.150
So what are going to say again that we will going to flip them around so we're going to say a caller

13:08.150 --> 13:17.910
over here call and hash tag on here 5 5 5 and then on here this is going to be the Magro.

13:18.210 --> 13:21.260
So basically what's going to happen is going to flip them around.

13:21.550 --> 13:29.870
So here we're going to grab this cooler get a copy and copy paste is right and then we're going to place

13:29.960 --> 13:31.590
a.

13:31.630 --> 13:32.050
Right.

13:32.150 --> 13:33.590
And you can see what we have.

13:33.870 --> 13:40.560
We have a knot of top end in three of her right to see what's happening right.

13:40.580 --> 13:45.300
So as I'm hovering over this thing right you can see that the color is changing.

13:45.320 --> 13:51.760
If this one was white now it's actually turning that now it's actually time to create this menu button

13:51.760 --> 13:52.420
on here.

13:52.670 --> 13:55.940
And then we're going to make much more sense of what we did over here.

13:55.980 --> 14:00.050
Right when we had to display flex and just fat content space between.

14:00.390 --> 14:08.110
So we're going to say that for the menu button menu and I'm going to say between this and the menu button

14:08.150 --> 14:10.230
button we're going to have a padding.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.820
Five pixels.

14:11.820 --> 14:12.430
All right.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.040
And you can see that we're starting working on here.

14:15.260 --> 14:23.430
Then after that we're going to have a border we're going to see border and this is going to be two pixels

14:23.720 --> 14:26.280
solid solid.

14:26.370 --> 14:32.430
We're here and we're going to say this is going to be a good hashtag to be here.

14:32.500 --> 14:36.830
Nine Eight an EF 0 miss.

14:36.950 --> 14:41.340
Then after that we're going to have a cursor and we're going to see a pointer.

14:41.360 --> 14:46.250
So as we were hovering over this is actually going to change right so you can see or hear becomes a

14:46.250 --> 14:47.060
pointer.

14:47.360 --> 14:52.460
And then after that we're going to have a line self and that's going to be Center.

14:52.550 --> 14:57.950
And again this is going to be for a few Xmarks because obviously there's going to be a difference of

14:57.980 --> 15:03.400
how actually they look because of what is the content for these guys over here.

15:03.410 --> 15:03.730
Right.

15:03.740 --> 15:06.180
Because both of them right now are on fluxbox.

15:06.470 --> 15:11.950
So I'm going to see or hear a line self say Center here like this.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.570
Then off to now we need to work with those actually bars.

15:14.570 --> 15:16.200
Right so we need to create.

15:16.550 --> 15:21.110
So here I'm going to say this is going to be bar one.

15:21.410 --> 15:26.600
And then I'm place a comma and all three classes bar to one here.

15:26.620 --> 15:33.170
And last one is going to be bar one here three and we're all going to say over here that we would want

15:33.770 --> 15:43.760
them to have a height of five pixels or we would want a with of 35 pixels on here.

15:43.760 --> 15:47.810
Then we want a background color green car.

15:47.840 --> 15:56.090
And again we're going to use the blue ones are going to to be here nine ain't an EF 0 here.

15:56.240 --> 16:01.740
And the last thing is going to be margin 5 pixels zero like this.

16:01.880 --> 16:09.730
And then we're going to say that we would want a transition and transition should be one second.

16:09.740 --> 16:15.450
So to say transition but we're going to see or hear transform.

16:16.280 --> 16:22.550
And this is going to be one second long or it is more like this.

16:22.550 --> 16:25.180
So now let's go over what we actually did.

16:25.190 --> 16:26.230
All right.

16:26.660 --> 16:28.360
So you see this now top.

16:28.730 --> 16:31.350
Right now we're selecting the whole thing.

16:31.460 --> 16:35.400
You can see over here that I have this play and this is flex.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.850
Right now I'm sitting in a flex box.

16:38.020 --> 16:40.880
Right so now there are actually side by side.

16:41.080 --> 16:41.650
Right.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.020
And then we have a space in between.

16:44.120 --> 16:47.000
So that pushes them all the way away from each other.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.090
Right now we just need some padding all around.

16:50.090 --> 16:50.460
All right.

16:50.490 --> 16:53.030
So this would be the set up for the small screen.

16:53.330 --> 16:59.840
Now after that you can see this one line self center and so it's doing this and you can see that it

16:59.880 --> 17:03.800
actually things move up a little bit right.

17:03.800 --> 17:12.800
So as I like to hear center there actually this button is centered regarding this or here text.

17:13.070 --> 17:13.310
Right.

17:13.310 --> 17:18.630
So therefore we're choosing this online self center and now we're done with this.

17:18.860 --> 17:23.240
We actually have a few things that actually work.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.970
Now what I'm what do I mean by the end right.

17:26.120 --> 17:33.440
So what I'm going to say here now I would want to actually set up that once I press the button and this

17:33.710 --> 17:36.250
actually all disappears.

17:36.560 --> 17:40.160
So let's go ahead and let's actually start working on it.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.880
So the first thing that I would want to do is actually get a query.

17:43.920 --> 17:49.880
So what I'm going to do here I'm going to go to Google and I'm going to say that this will be Jake worry

17:50.720 --> 17:57.640
here and this is going to be Google CD and CD and here.

17:58.020 --> 18:01.730
Then you can see that this is going to be Google hosted libraries.

18:01.870 --> 18:05.840
So we're going to pick this guy over here and we're going to find where it is.

18:05.840 --> 18:06.140
Right.

18:06.140 --> 18:08.850
So we're going to grab the script here.

18:08.870 --> 18:13.070
This is going to be Jay Querrey and the reason why we're picking Jake we're here because this is pretty

18:13.070 --> 18:18.590
much going to be a few lines of code and we're going to have a responsive nav bar.

18:18.860 --> 18:25.130
So we're going to go back over here and we need to go back to in Exige the amount and or all the way

18:25.130 --> 18:30.040
in the bottom we're going to say this is going to be coming out and this is going to be J.

18:30.040 --> 18:34.040
Where are you going to do is copy and paste this.

18:34.170 --> 18:37.270
And over here we're going to say this is going to be script.

18:37.430 --> 18:38.300
Yes.

18:38.390 --> 18:45.440
So now we have a script tags and there's going to be source within the source right now we need to create

18:45.500 --> 18:46.280
a script.

18:46.380 --> 18:47.380
Yes.

18:47.420 --> 18:53.020
So we're going to see a new file like this and we're going to have a script.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.150
Yes.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.180
So it's a script.

18:56.870 --> 18:57.450
Yes.

18:57.640 --> 18:57.920
Right.

18:57.920 --> 19:03.950
So now I can see that they are actually linked and they are working now in order to test whether this

19:03.950 --> 19:09.890
is working or you need to write a jack where you function and don't worry if you don't know Jake Weary

19:09.920 --> 19:15.380
or if you haven't worked with Jake where the only thing you need to really do is just actually type

19:15.380 --> 19:19.210
this or you can just copy pasted from your source files.

19:19.380 --> 19:24.750
So I'm going to say document document here to really function.

19:25.100 --> 19:28.680
So I'm going to saying if the document ready something should happen.

19:28.870 --> 19:31.520
No real going to say a function no.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.150
Here we're going to write what should happen right.

19:34.170 --> 19:42.830
So I can just say every simple word and I just say hello world just to see whether it's working.

19:43.010 --> 19:47.460
If we're fresh you can see that now we're going to have a hello world so everything is working.

19:47.710 --> 19:53.240
Again don't worry if you don't worry you can just copy and paste of what we're actually doing.

19:53.240 --> 20:00.170
So what we're saying here is that we would want our query to run only when the document is loaded.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.750
So then here we're going to have a dollar sign.

20:03.220 --> 20:08.030
And within the dollars then we're going to say this is going to be a menu here.

20:08.030 --> 20:17.080
Hash tag menu BT end on here and we're going to say click on here and here we're going to write a function

20:17.350 --> 20:24.620
and the function is going to be change and I'm going to say that now once we have this function now

20:24.620 --> 20:26.490
we actually need to write the function.

20:26.760 --> 20:31.070
So here I'm going to say this is going to be a function change.

20:31.220 --> 20:37.790
I have more here and then we're going to have parentheses and curly braces and or here we're going to

20:37.790 --> 20:45.050
say that we would want to select on this guy so we would want to select the links on here like this

20:45.140 --> 20:53.780
and hash tag links and then we're going to say that this would be a function toggle here and we're going

20:53.780 --> 21:00.310
to say two seconds because two thousand milliseconds actually stand for a few seconds.

21:00.380 --> 21:03.920
And basically this line of code was the only reason why we don't.

21:04.120 --> 21:04.500
Right.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.530
Because this is actually very fast.

21:06.540 --> 21:09.710
We can just add this method over here of toggle.

21:09.870 --> 21:13.160
And now once I'm going to click the button you can see what's going to happen.

21:13.250 --> 21:16.090
So I'm going to say this group J.S. and it's great.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.400
So they're all here next.

21:18.410 --> 21:20.150
And let's check it out.

21:20.270 --> 21:20.600
Right.

21:20.600 --> 21:24.470
And you can see what happens right now every time I press the button.

21:24.470 --> 21:25.040
Right.

21:25.160 --> 21:33.110
I actually have a responsive nav bar mate meaning that I can click over here and my links appear and

21:33.120 --> 21:34.470
are here to disappear.

21:34.730 --> 21:40.890
And now the last thing that I would want to actually do is I would want where these bars are changing.

21:41.240 --> 21:44.710
So we're going to go back to Maine she says this.

21:44.840 --> 21:51.430
And what we're going to say is we're going to add a few more classes and the class is going to be turned.

21:51.500 --> 21:56.210
So I'm going to say we're here and this is going to be turned right so this is going to be the class

21:56.210 --> 21:59.810
name and I'm going to say for the bar one what should happen.

22:00.070 --> 22:00.660
No.

22:01.100 --> 22:07.240
You can see that we had a transition right transform right and on here we were going right.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.590
This is going to be transformed.

22:08.870 --> 22:15.880
And the value from transform is going to be rotate and we're going to say negative here negative.

22:16.250 --> 22:23.230
And this is going to be negative 45 degrees negative forty five degrees then we're going to say translate.

22:23.300 --> 22:30.280
So and this is going to be negative 7 pixels here 6 pixels.

22:30.420 --> 22:30.850
Right.

22:31.070 --> 22:37.130
And again we can go back over here and once we're done then it's actually easier to show you what's

22:37.130 --> 22:42.950
happening because we can change the values and you can see what is going to happen right then all of

22:42.960 --> 22:44.060
this is going to be turn.

22:44.150 --> 22:47.920
And this is going to be class bar to all like this.

22:48.080 --> 22:52.450
And for this one I was going to say opacity and we're going to say zero.

22:52.520 --> 22:53.030
Right.

22:53.090 --> 22:55.780
So the middle one actually is going to disappear.

22:55.940 --> 23:01.910
And then after another we're going to have a turn around and this is going to be bar three right.

23:02.020 --> 23:10.630
So one by one we have bar one or two or three here and we're going to have is transform and again we're

23:10.630 --> 23:14.590
going to have the same values but we're going to change them around.

23:14.650 --> 23:15.340
Right.

23:15.400 --> 23:22.090
So you say your copy is going to be copy paste this is actually going to be all going to say this is

23:22.090 --> 23:24.980
going to be 45 degrees not negative.

23:25.300 --> 23:29.080
And over here we're going to say negative seven and negative eight.

23:29.310 --> 23:32.860
So here like this will have a negative rate.

23:33.220 --> 23:34.430
So let's say this.

23:34.650 --> 23:40.300
And the last thing that we would want to do is actually add this in our Jacqui.

23:40.340 --> 23:46.260
All right so again once we click the button that the bar should change around and I'm going to say dollar

23:46.280 --> 23:53.210
sign and then I'm going to say this is going to be a hash tag menu Betty and.

23:53.390 --> 23:53.640
Right.

23:53.650 --> 23:55.070
So for the whole button.

23:55.300 --> 23:59.830
So now I'm not saying that I'm targeting the length and targeting the actual button and I'm going to

23:59.830 --> 24:04.340
say toggle class and or here we're going to write a class.

24:04.340 --> 24:07.530
So I'm going to say we're here and we're here like this.

24:07.550 --> 24:12.450
So once we say this here you can see what's happening with these bars right.

24:12.640 --> 24:17.730
So first my links are disappearing and appearing right click on here.

24:17.740 --> 24:20.120
But look what happens with the bars right.

24:20.140 --> 24:26.980
So we have all here this cross and it goes back to normal bars and again now we can go back over here

24:26.980 --> 24:29.260
and actually have a look what's happening right.

24:29.260 --> 24:31.480
So this is going to rotate the bar.

24:31.690 --> 24:33.290
And this is actually going to move it.

24:33.340 --> 24:38.500
Right so here let's change the values and let's say here and this is going to be 65 degrees.

24:38.500 --> 24:39.040
Right.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.420
And let's say this is going to be 10.

24:41.680 --> 24:46.020
And this is actually the easiest way how you can work with this right because then you can see where

24:46.020 --> 24:47.160
you're actually going.

24:47.350 --> 24:48.680
So we say this.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.460
There are few things happening.

24:50.620 --> 24:54.120
First of all we can see that this line is much bigger over here right.

24:54.310 --> 24:58.730
And also the actual bottom right because this is the value or here right.

24:58.730 --> 25:02.470
So here I can have a 20 pixel's 30 pixels right.

25:02.530 --> 25:06.910
You can see we're actually moving on here if we change these values.

25:06.920 --> 25:07.210
Right.

25:07.210 --> 25:10.840
Also you can see where you are actually moving this bar right.

25:10.900 --> 25:15.380
So this is how we can actually find out what is actually happening.

25:15.380 --> 25:16.450
Exactly right.

25:16.510 --> 25:23.350
So here with this one we're just turning it right over here we're actually moving it around the actual

25:23.350 --> 25:24.500
candidates right.

25:24.760 --> 25:31.780
So here what I'm going to go back and then I'll go back to our values and that was 45 degrees negative

25:32.920 --> 25:42.040
45 here and we're going to say negative seven pixels on this and then we're going to have a 6 pixels

25:42.570 --> 25:43.090
on here.

25:43.160 --> 25:44.090
That's right.

25:44.170 --> 25:53.440
Man what we would want to do right now is actually go ahead and add a few x values for when we're actually

25:53.440 --> 25:54.640
making our screen bigger.

25:54.640 --> 25:55.220
Right.

25:55.270 --> 25:57.470
Because again this was for a small screen.

25:57.530 --> 25:58.110
Right.

25:58.150 --> 26:06.250
So let's go ahead and let's add some rules then as we're changing the value of our screen size actually

26:06.630 --> 26:13.060
our neighbors are responding differently because for now the only thing we have done is create an NAV

26:13.060 --> 26:15.720
bar and we added some functionality.
