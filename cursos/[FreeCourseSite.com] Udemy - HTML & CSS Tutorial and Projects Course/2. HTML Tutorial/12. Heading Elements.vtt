00:00.570 --> 00:01.090
Excellent.

00:01.140 --> 00:07.290
Well finally going to take a deep dive into age the AML component and our first component is gonna be

00:07.290 --> 00:08.030
heading.

00:08.100 --> 00:12.470
Now we obviously have already covered headings because they need to do something with examples.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.050
Pretty much.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.480
I couldn't have them empty.

00:14.490 --> 00:19.310
So you're already a little bit familiar with headings but let me go over the whole spiel again.

00:19.440 --> 00:24.210
Basically headings would be titles so if you think of any kind of document you'll then have a title

00:24.570 --> 00:27.500
and for that we have headings now for the headings.

00:27.510 --> 00:33.510
We have six types starting with having one and ending with adding six and obviously having one would

00:33.510 --> 00:36.330
be the biggest one and heading six would be the smallest.

00:36.930 --> 00:43.670
So let's start with having one again we can use them notoriously and we can have a tab or enter or return.

00:43.800 --> 00:49.260
And then here I am just going to say I am I am heading and we're going to type adding 1.

00:49.410 --> 00:54.150
Now what I'm gonna do right now is I'm just going to copy and paste this line later on I'm gonna show

00:54.150 --> 00:55.770
you some keyboard keep it.

00:55.920 --> 01:01.320
But for now we're all gonna be basically doing this manually like we would do normally on a computer

01:01.680 --> 01:06.570
meaning we'll get to do it with copy and paste later on we're going to look at a keyboard shortcuts

01:06.600 --> 01:09.660
that we're going to improve again our workflow tremendously.

01:09.660 --> 01:14.880
So let me first of all copy this and let's say that the second line and maybe for this one let's make

01:14.880 --> 01:19.230
it as the heading to sort of change these values as well as this guy.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.760
So let me say this.

01:20.770 --> 01:25.890
And sure enough now I have a heading to now maybe in this case I can just copy and paste it again two

01:25.890 --> 01:27.050
of them right away.

01:27.210 --> 01:29.950
And one more time so then I'm gonna have six of them.

01:30.060 --> 01:31.700
So here I would like to change the values.

01:31.700 --> 01:39.820
So this would be heading three and four and five and adding six and the same old spiel over here.

01:39.810 --> 01:47.160
Well obviously not having sex but we'll have having three and four and having sex and again same old

01:47.160 --> 01:52.760
thing like with the rest of the elements and we're gonna have we're gonna have the element that is enclosed

01:52.770 --> 01:55.840
in an angle brackets as well as the closing tag.

01:55.920 --> 02:01.050
So whatever is gonna go inside between these two zags is gonna be my heading.

02:01.050 --> 02:05.230
So obviously if you want to write a paragraph you can write a paragraph in a heading.

02:05.250 --> 02:10.860
Now I don't know any case where you would want to use that obviously title is self-explanatory.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.030
That is the title.

02:12.030 --> 02:17.250
So depending on how long or the titles you write what I guess one word two words or ten words but in

02:17.250 --> 02:21.240
general you'd probably wouldn't want to have a title that is actually a paragraph.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.080
We have specific paragraph tag for it.

02:24.090 --> 02:25.390
Now I digress a little bit.

02:25.410 --> 02:30.270
But let's say first of all this is going to be hitting three and four because I didn't have the numbers

02:30.720 --> 02:32.520
sorry I was cheating a little bit.

02:32.730 --> 02:33.980
So let me say this.

02:34.100 --> 02:37.020
And sure enough as you can see right now we have six headings.

02:37.230 --> 02:43.170
So depending on the situation obviously you would pick a heading that you would like to use for that

02:43.170 --> 02:44.310
particular situation.
