00:00.240 --> 00:05.160
Moving on we're gonna talk about positions whether that's going to be static whether that's going to

00:05.160 --> 00:06.000
be fixed.

00:06.090 --> 00:08.390
We also have relative an absolute.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.050
Not the first one is going to be static.

00:10.050 --> 00:15.510
But to tell you honestly most of the this video we're gonna do with the setup for the next positions

00:15.750 --> 00:21.390
because the static is gonna be by default and there's gonna be nothing really exciting about that position

00:21.390 --> 00:22.260
value.

00:22.260 --> 00:26.230
Now what I would want to do is I'm gonna get rid of this Dave.

00:26.370 --> 00:29.490
I'm gonna say there's gonna be another Dave just a simple Dave.

00:29.490 --> 00:34.710
Then let's add a two paragraphs with let's say I don't know 40 words here or maybe you know what.

00:34.710 --> 00:38.310
That was an overkill I think 20 is gonna be fine.

00:38.310 --> 00:39.050
I can just save it.

00:39.060 --> 00:45.750
So that's gonna be my paragraph then for this guy I'm gonna add class of 1 then I'm gonna do exactly

00:45.750 --> 00:49.520
the same with the next one where the class is gonna be number two.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.940
That's gonna be sufficient enough.

00:52.110 --> 00:55.430
And then within this paragraph let me add this back.

00:55.890 --> 00:59.910
I can tell you right away though that again this plan is not special.

01:00.060 --> 01:05.160
The positioning we're going to use is gonna be special but it's gonna work with any kind of element.

01:05.220 --> 01:09.040
In my case I'm using Spain as an example but you can use anything.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.890
And here I'm gonna say I am.

01:10.940 --> 01:17.970
Or Hey I am so hey buddy I am absolute now at this moment.

01:17.970 --> 01:20.580
He is not or she is not absolute at all.

01:20.580 --> 01:27.690
But later on we're gonna make it absolute and let's say class is gonna be special and this is gonna

01:27.690 --> 01:29.090
be our special kid.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.660
We have the hey I'm absolute.

01:31.170 --> 01:32.740
So what do we have in CSX.

01:33.740 --> 01:35.080
Let's start with Dave.

01:35.090 --> 01:41.630
Dave is gonna be boarder and I have a warning for you in this video or next following videos.

01:41.660 --> 01:47.510
The coloring is not gonna be the most exciting one who's gonna be actually quite hideous but hopefully

01:47.510 --> 01:49.590
we're gonna be able to get through this.

01:49.730 --> 01:51.480
Let's do background yellow.

01:51.770 --> 01:58.940
And my hope was is that it would help you at least understand the general idea what we'll see.

01:58.940 --> 02:00.350
Maybe it's gonna be the opposite.

02:00.350 --> 02:03.090
Maybe you'll be like well this doesn't make sense at all.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.510
So I don't know.

02:04.520 --> 02:07.160
We'll see we'll have margin to operate away.

02:07.160 --> 02:10.610
Again this is gonna make a little bit more sense later on.

02:10.610 --> 02:11.700
So I have the day.

02:11.700 --> 02:12.790
It has a margin top.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.200
You know what.

02:13.430 --> 02:14.640
I'm gonna have more.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.100
I'm gonna say 40 pixels.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.270
Then what else I have.

02:17.270 --> 02:20.900
Well I have two paragraphs now for that one.

02:20.930 --> 02:24.260
I'm gonna do a I'm not padding.

02:24.260 --> 02:26.140
Background is gonna be blue.

02:26.450 --> 02:27.860
So that's my one.

02:27.870 --> 02:32.820
Then I'm also gonna select it and I'm going to select it properly.

02:32.990 --> 02:34.710
I'm going to say oh you know what.

02:34.710 --> 02:38.580
And the lead in I'm gonna say that I'm selecting this guy.

02:38.780 --> 02:42.780
We are copying pasting for number two.

02:42.960 --> 02:49.170
I don't know we can do maybe number two is gonna be I don't know what we could do.

02:49.290 --> 02:51.060
Green what do you think.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.640
Yeah I think green is gonna be fine.

02:53.170 --> 02:57.070
Okay so we have number two and then we have the class of special.

02:57.180 --> 02:59.510
Now for a class of special let's just add.

02:59.790 --> 03:00.180
I don't know.

03:00.180 --> 03:07.090
Background and I chose something like this like coral which is again going to be very very hairy.

03:07.140 --> 03:10.170
But we're gonna live with that font size.

03:10.170 --> 03:13.020
I don't know 20 pixels something like this.

03:13.050 --> 03:15.140
So this is gonna be my spam.

03:15.240 --> 03:22.380
Like I said position static is very very boring because all the elements again by default just have

03:22.380 --> 03:29.850
this position static what position Static means in general that if I had this class with para I'm sorry

03:30.060 --> 03:35.820
paragraph with the class of number two after the paragraph with the class of 1 This is how it's gonna

03:35.820 --> 03:36.420
be displayed.

03:36.930 --> 03:39.960
So that's gonna be exactly our normal flow of document.

03:39.990 --> 03:45.410
So if I'm having here in the span let's say after the text then this is gonna be displayed after text.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.180
Now where would you use the position of static.

03:48.190 --> 03:52.190
Well similarly remember how we had the text the line property.

03:52.200 --> 03:56.460
So if I had let's say text on line of all of them right.

03:56.610 --> 04:03.720
If I would want some of them just to be normal one I used to use a text and then we use text the line

04:03.720 --> 04:04.380
left.

04:04.380 --> 04:10.950
Now in general by default all of them were and this is obviously a mistake all of them were text aligned

04:10.950 --> 04:11.650
to the left.

04:11.820 --> 04:17.580
But if you set the parent to some kind of let's say text line right then you use this default one well

04:17.580 --> 04:19.050
the same with the position static.

04:19.950 --> 04:24.420
If you're going to use some kind of different positioning for the parent then if you would want some

04:24.540 --> 04:30.660
other one within that parent to have the normal positioning when the static then you would use position

04:30.660 --> 04:36.070
static otherwise you can write it here I can say position and I'm not going to use a relative.

04:36.420 --> 04:37.630
I'm going to use static.

04:37.650 --> 04:42.750
You'll notice that nothing is going to change because by default all of them having this position static.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.230
So that's the reason why everything stays the same.
