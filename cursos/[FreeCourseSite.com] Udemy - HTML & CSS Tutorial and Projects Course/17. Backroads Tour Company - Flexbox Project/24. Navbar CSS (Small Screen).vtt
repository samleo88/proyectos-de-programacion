00:00.630 --> 00:03.510
So let's not waste any of our time.

00:03.510 --> 00:07.710
Let's head over to styles reassess and start styling.

00:07.980 --> 00:15.420
And our first concern is going to be this image because again we are using the image correct.

00:15.420 --> 00:17.220
So we have a source for images.

00:17.220 --> 00:18.660
That's our logo.

00:19.050 --> 00:25.560
And then since I would like to apply for all my images to have with hundred and then display a block

00:25.860 --> 00:28.350
Well that's the reason why it looks this way.

00:28.850 --> 00:31.160
And there's multiple ways how we can do that.

00:31.230 --> 00:38.660
But one of the need ways how we can in fact fix it is by using not selector.

00:38.670 --> 00:40.140
So how does that work.

00:40.140 --> 00:48.030
Well I can just head over to my AMG where I'm selecting all the images and then let's type colon knot

00:48.390 --> 00:54.790
and then within the parentheses we just need to type well which element should be excluded.

00:54.930 --> 00:57.920
And what I'm looking for is nav logo.

00:57.930 --> 01:03.760
Now why I'm looking for that political class because that is the class that I set up for this image.

01:04.020 --> 01:07.020
If your value is different please type 1.

01:07.080 --> 01:08.760
Now at the moment we're going to save it.

01:08.850 --> 01:15.060
In fact our logo is going to be exactly how I set it up within my images.

01:15.630 --> 01:22.520
Because within the logo I squeegee as you see I have the width of 175 and the height in fact is 30 and

01:22.680 --> 01:28.590
previously 100 percent for the very simple reason because I was targeting all the images.

01:28.620 --> 01:33.840
Now I would still like to keep all the images because that's very neat where for each and every time

01:33.840 --> 01:35.970
I'm adding the image I don't have to worry about it.

01:36.110 --> 01:40.670
OK but in this particular case I would like to exclude it.

01:40.710 --> 01:42.130
That's number one.

01:42.150 --> 01:45.280
Then let's actually scroll down.

01:45.390 --> 01:46.720
Where is our number.

01:46.720 --> 01:52.860
And of course I could have used that also the finder but in this case I just decided to scroll.

01:52.950 --> 01:55.620
And then why don't we first check it out.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.650
As far as our initial setup.

01:58.710 --> 02:05.470
So before we're going to set it up a fixed number that is eventually her goal because you're going to

02:05.470 --> 02:12.300
notice eventually once we set up our JavaScript in fact our NAV bar is going to be fixed as we start

02:12.300 --> 02:13.240
scrolling.

02:13.260 --> 02:20.010
Now before that in fact we are going to use whatever background color we do have for our whole project

02:20.430 --> 02:23.160
because remember we said the body with this off white.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.250
And in fact I didn't change it.

02:25.260 --> 02:25.770
All right.

02:25.840 --> 02:32.190
Now technically if you don't like the color you can do something like this nav bar and background of

02:32.190 --> 02:33.430
red right.

02:33.780 --> 02:39.750
But I just left it the way it is now I'm going to comment this out just so you can remember maybe you're

02:39.750 --> 02:44.340
going to use it later on but I just went with the same color that I have for the body.

02:44.340 --> 02:48.900
That's number one that I would like to mention that right away on a small screen size.

02:49.080 --> 02:52.520
I wouldn't want to display these social media icons.

02:52.830 --> 02:58.230
So the first rule we're going to write is in fact nav icons display of none because I don't want to

02:58.230 --> 02:58.770
show them.

02:59.190 --> 03:02.150
So let's write a display of none.

03:02.210 --> 03:04.060
That's it icons are gone.

03:04.260 --> 03:06.420
And then let's start focusing on the header.

03:06.420 --> 03:14.400
And like I said my header is the logo as well as this little button that later on is going to be used

03:14.400 --> 03:17.610
for my toggling when we set up our javascript.

03:17.730 --> 03:24.120
So let's say like this Let's say now I've had her then four and I have her first of all I would like

03:24.120 --> 03:29.800
to have some padding top bottom one our arms to our arms on the sides like.

03:29.910 --> 03:35.140
So then why don't we set up display flex some display flex.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.740
So now they're displayed as a flex box.

03:38.790 --> 03:44.070
Why don't we add justified content because I would like to again push them as far as possible from each

03:44.070 --> 03:47.030
other space between like so.

03:47.370 --> 03:53.970
But I would also like to align my button in the center in the center on this logo.

03:54.270 --> 03:58.930
So why don't we say a line items and center like so.

03:58.930 --> 04:01.350
So now my button is sitting in the center.

04:01.360 --> 04:04.690
Then let's start working with my button.

04:04.690 --> 04:12.990
And remember we had a class of nof toggle now for enough toggle why don't we go with background of transparent

04:13.500 --> 04:26.520
where my button then border non border non outline on line non like so and then font size is going to

04:26.520 --> 04:29.560
be increased to one point five.

04:29.580 --> 04:32.900
Ari Ms kept color.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.490
We're going to have it as a primary color.

04:35.760 --> 04:44.280
So my var primary color and then cursor pointer as we're hovering we're going to have our cursor as

04:44.280 --> 04:45.210
a pointer.

04:45.210 --> 04:51.300
And lastly there's going to be a main transition because what I would like to do as I'm hovering over

04:51.300 --> 04:53.810
the icon I would want to scale it little bit.

04:53.850 --> 05:00.860
So remember we had a transition property and then we could use the value of main transition so main

05:00.860 --> 05:02.000
transition.

05:02.000 --> 05:10.280
And lastly like I said as we're hovering as we do nav toggle hover I would just like to make my button

05:10.400 --> 05:11.580
a bit bigger.

05:11.720 --> 05:16.070
So why don't we write transform scale one point two.

05:16.100 --> 05:23.420
And then once we add the scale notice when we're going to hover our button is gonna get bigger.

05:23.450 --> 05:32.240
Now I would also like to work with nav links so all the guys over here so have home about services and

05:32.240 --> 05:33.840
featured and gallery and all that.

05:34.400 --> 05:42.350
So let's target them one by one by saying nav link and then as far as my links I would want to display

05:42.350 --> 05:42.720
them.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.840
BLOCK So display them as a block.

05:44.840 --> 05:48.500
Now they're in fact stacked one on top of each other.

05:48.530 --> 05:51.790
Why don't we add also right away some padding.

05:51.890 --> 05:57.230
So one RTM is going to be Tom bottom and then two or three M's on the side.

05:57.230 --> 06:02.960
And if you noticed I was using the same two arms for my header and that's the reason why I set up for

06:02.960 --> 06:03.770
left and right.

06:03.770 --> 06:08.100
Also my lab link padding then color.

06:08.360 --> 06:17.550
I'm gonna go with main black so main block is going to be my color text transform I'm going gonna set

06:17.550 --> 06:24.960
it up as capitalized and in this case as you see I added a colon or I'm sorry not a colon I added a

06:24.960 --> 06:26.110
quotation mark.

06:26.250 --> 06:30.010
So now I fix that so textures from capitalized font.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.490
Wait why don't we use it as bold and line letter spacing.

06:35.490 --> 06:41.410
We're gonna have our main spacing mains pacing like so.

06:41.850 --> 06:47.240
And last but not least as I'm hovering I would like to have few effects.

06:47.460 --> 06:49.210
And let me show you what I mean.

06:49.230 --> 06:52.410
So as I'm hovering I would like to change the background color for my link.

06:52.410 --> 06:57.090
I would like to change the color and I would like to add a little bit of padding on the left hand side.

06:57.450 --> 07:02.010
So I have this effect of LINQ actually moving to the right now.

07:02.460 --> 07:10.680
So we have our property for that and the properties transition where I would like to have all these

07:10.680 --> 07:12.690
changes happening over time.

07:12.840 --> 07:19.250
So I just go with main transition and then now let's set up our hover links.

07:19.650 --> 07:30.100
Let's say nav link however and once we set up this hover I would like to do a color of primary color.

07:31.040 --> 07:41.280
Primary Color then background of dark gray background dark gray like so.

07:41.450 --> 07:45.290
And then last but not least padding is going to be a little bit darker.

07:45.350 --> 07:53.000
So if I currently have my padding as you are Iams since I would like to move my text to the right when

07:53.000 --> 07:59.600
I use 2.5 Miriam's like so so notice what happens as I'm hovering.

07:59.740 --> 08:04.760
Well actually added padding all around I should add padding left.

08:04.790 --> 08:05.880
This is gonna be better.

08:06.050 --> 08:09.350
As you see as I'm hovering now I have my legs.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.270
Okay.

08:10.370 --> 08:15.600
And that should do it in fact for our small screen nav bar layout.

08:16.130 --> 08:23.120
So next video I would like to cover how we're gonna set up our C assess once we get to a bigger screen

08:23.120 --> 08:23.440
size.
