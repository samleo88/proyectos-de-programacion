WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:04.540
As far as our CSF is concerned let's head over to Stiles.

00:04.540 --> 00:05.580
Yes yes.

00:05.640 --> 00:09.990
Then of course we do have our about I'm going to navigate all the way in the bottom.

00:09.990 --> 00:11.720
I'm going to copy and paste.

00:11.730 --> 00:19.020
In fact these lines of comments and then I'm gonna change some values here where it is not going to

00:19.020 --> 00:20.110
be about.

00:20.460 --> 00:27.650
Course I'm going to call this services and then of course end of services as well services.

00:27.690 --> 00:28.490
Okay.

00:28.680 --> 00:33.360
Now once we have our comments set up why don't we start with a service class.

00:33.450 --> 00:38.740
Remember that was the class that was on the article so let's right service class.

00:39.090 --> 00:45.570
And for this particular class I would like to have a text line properly with the value of center so

00:45.570 --> 00:52.290
all my content in listening and center as well as why don't we add a margin bottom let's say three arms

00:52.520 --> 00:52.850
right.

00:53.220 --> 00:59.770
So that way we're gonna have some kind of margin in between the actual each and every service.

00:59.910 --> 01:03.480
Then we're gonna do some styling for the service icon.

01:04.030 --> 01:10.610
So service icon class and then let me scroll up a little bit just so you can see a little bit more clearer.

01:10.730 --> 01:13.170
Why don't we start first with a background.

01:13.290 --> 01:16.000
And remember we had the primary color.

01:16.020 --> 01:18.870
So that is exactly what I'm gonna use right now.

01:18.870 --> 01:26.940
That is of course my service icon but it has to be some kind of issue because right now what I see happening

01:26.970 --> 01:31.630
is that I have service icon here that is not what I wanted.

01:31.650 --> 01:38.790
So I believe the class that I wanted in fact to create was a service in for some reason I created this

01:38.790 --> 01:40.860
as a service icon.

01:40.860 --> 01:42.300
My apologies.

01:42.350 --> 01:46.820
Now let me select all what say three of them.

01:47.370 --> 01:48.680
Let's do it this way.

01:48.720 --> 01:52.440
Let's delete them and let's in fact rename them.

01:53.250 --> 01:59.480
Now this case I again selected the wrong one this should be an icon.

01:59.740 --> 02:04.300
Then I should change the second one to aim for.

02:04.330 --> 02:12.810
So on the same goes for the second one I should have this as an icon and this should be an info.

02:13.200 --> 02:21.750
So again just to recap instead of adding the class of service icon to a div which would be the same

02:21.750 --> 02:23.360
class like I had before.

02:23.370 --> 02:26.110
Instead we're shooting for service info.

02:26.370 --> 02:29.990
My apologies I didn't mess with this one up.

02:30.570 --> 02:35.300
Now as I said for the service icon First I would want some background color.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.600
Then we would want some other styles as well.

02:38.820 --> 02:44.300
So we why we don't we had a pattern of zero point five grams.

02:44.520 --> 02:51.090
So there's gonna be a little bit more padding we can do display inline block display in the line block

02:51.380 --> 02:56.930
like so so that way all the margins are in fact respected.

02:57.180 --> 03:02.580
If there's going to be any kind of margins and then why don't we also maybe add a little bit of font

03:02.580 --> 03:08.770
size so let's increase it to to our arms you are Ms.

03:08.840 --> 03:15.260
Last but not least I'm gonna add some marching in the bottom so margin bottom one point five.

03:15.480 --> 03:16.990
Ari Ms.

03:17.060 --> 03:22.780
MIKE So once we have the margin the service title is going to be next.

03:22.790 --> 03:30.490
So service title and then here why don't we do tax transform and uppercase.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.400
So my title is going to be uppercase.

03:33.560 --> 03:38.220
Last but not least I would like to add some styles to a service text.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.960
This guy over here.

03:40.400 --> 03:48.320
Some writes service text and then I'm going to go with the width of 80 percent so the width is going

03:48.320 --> 03:50.050
to be a little bit smaller.

03:50.240 --> 03:55.700
And then of course I would like to place it in the center so I'm going to use margin zero to bottom

03:55.700 --> 03:56.590
left and right order.

03:57.250 --> 04:04.590
And then why don't we also change the line height here and let's write let's say one point five.

04:04.590 --> 04:05.870
And why don't we.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.250
Yeah that should do it.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.970
I think that looks really really good.

04:09.980 --> 04:16.970
So once we have this particular set up why don't we set up our columns because if we look at my final

04:16.970 --> 04:24.530
project we're going to notice that once we get to a five hundred and seventy six pixels or essentially

04:24.530 --> 04:28.520
bigger than 576 we're gonna have a two column layout right.

04:28.570 --> 04:30.410
So that is going to be our two column land.

04:30.710 --> 04:35.570
But before that of course we just have a single column which is exactly what we have right now.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.900
So let's set up our media query.

04:38.470 --> 04:39.050
That's right.

04:39.050 --> 04:45.140
Media screen and and we're going to go with men with here.

04:45.180 --> 04:46.100
And why don't we start.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.870
Like I said with 576.

04:47.960 --> 04:53.150
But as always it's really up to you if you'd like to have a two column layout on a bigger screen on

04:53.150 --> 04:54.190
a smaller screen.

04:54.290 --> 04:56.090
Again just change the values.

04:56.090 --> 04:58.060
So what I would like to do right now.

04:58.070 --> 05:00.640
Well first of all I have the services center class.

05:00.740 --> 05:01.100
Correct.

05:01.100 --> 05:05.150
So why don't we write Services Center.

05:05.300 --> 05:11.500
Let's use our display flex so we're going to write display flex.

05:11.750 --> 05:17.060
Now I'm going to show you right away on a bigger screen size because I think it just makes a little

05:17.060 --> 05:18.130
bit more sense.

05:18.140 --> 05:25.160
So once we get to a five so six notice of course I do have right now my layout but that is not exactly

05:25.160 --> 05:30.530
what I would want because I would want a two column and this right away gives me a three column layout.

05:30.530 --> 05:35.640
And the reason for that is because I'm just using display flex and I have three items.

05:35.750 --> 05:38.700
Now why don't we add four to each and every service.

05:38.720 --> 05:42.030
Also the width of that particular service.

05:42.050 --> 05:47.900
So again I'm going to write service some targeting each and every service and I know that since this

05:47.900 --> 05:55.430
is a flex box child I can just use flex I'm going to say I don't want to service the girl or shrink

05:55.820 --> 06:01.820
and instead I would like to use a calc function and then let's say that since I would want a two column

06:01.820 --> 06:10.700
while I'm just gonna write okay I would want each and every service to be 50 percent minus one RTM for

06:10.700 --> 06:14.730
some kind of margin in between let's say that.

06:14.900 --> 06:21.830
And now we should have this layout of course I do have my 50 percent but I do have also my third service

06:22.130 --> 06:23.690
stretching horizontally.

06:23.700 --> 06:28.950
And the reason for that because I 50 percent 50 percent and this guy doesn't fit.

06:29.360 --> 06:35.870
So we're going to have to head over back to the services center and then let's just write our comment

06:36.160 --> 06:40.830
and I'm just adding this comment of after to kind of explain what is happening.

06:40.850 --> 06:45.470
I could have rolled right away both of these properties with the values right after the Flex which would

06:45.470 --> 06:47.440
normally something you would do.

06:47.540 --> 06:52.550
The reason why I'm using this after is to kind of show you that we first set up our two column layout

06:52.850 --> 06:58.970
and then we're gonna add the properties with the values to service the center to in fact fix it.

06:59.200 --> 07:04.270
Because if we're just going to add or leave it the way it is of course it's not going to work.

07:04.640 --> 07:10.730
So this way as I'm writing this I think it makes a little more sense where you see the shortcoming of

07:10.730 --> 07:13.310
just using the 50 percent minus one RTM.

07:13.520 --> 07:17.080
Without these properties and values and then that way you can be like OK.

07:17.110 --> 07:20.260
So I understand fully what those properties are doing.

07:20.270 --> 07:25.430
So first of all I would like to use a flex wrap and let's set this equal to a wrap.

07:25.990 --> 07:31.000
So in this case once we head over back of course we have a nice two column layout one column second

07:31.000 --> 07:34.750
column and we have a third item sitting in the first column.

07:34.840 --> 07:37.450
Some of that is really really well.

07:37.450 --> 07:44.860
But I would also want to use the fact that I do have these margins correct because our item is 50 percent

07:44.890 --> 07:46.370
minus one RTM.

07:46.540 --> 07:49.590
So it's less than 50 percent by one area.

07:49.780 --> 07:55.380
And we can use that by doing justify content and we're just going to have space between.

07:55.840 --> 08:01.560
So we are going to push these items as far as possible from each other.

08:01.570 --> 08:04.940
Now on this particular layout it is not a big deal.

08:04.970 --> 08:08.140
There's not much of a actual difference.

08:08.140 --> 08:08.680
Right.

08:08.800 --> 08:14.380
Because the items are small to begin with but in general this is what I really like to do where I'm

08:14.380 --> 08:17.630
just pushing the items as far as possible from each other.

08:17.650 --> 08:20.660
Now that would be 576.

08:20.710 --> 08:24.100
Now why don't we head over to a nine hundred ninety two.

08:24.550 --> 08:29.980
So once we get to let's say nine out of 92 I would like to have a three column layout.

08:31.060 --> 08:38.530
Now the way we do that is very simply we can just write a new media query but in my case I'm just going

08:38.530 --> 08:45.170
to copy and paste it in this way we're gonna go together and figure out what is in fact changing.

08:45.190 --> 08:45.600
All right.

08:45.640 --> 08:51.010
Because we only need to in fact apply the styles for the items that are changing.

08:51.550 --> 08:56.960
So display is going to be flex like it is starting already from five six.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.450
So we don't care about that.

08:58.480 --> 09:01.970
And in fact we don't care anything about the services center.

09:01.990 --> 09:06.480
So all this is already set up within the 576.

09:06.540 --> 09:06.930
Right.

09:06.970 --> 09:08.840
We have all the styles already here.

09:08.950 --> 09:11.930
So we really don't care about services center.

09:11.980 --> 09:15.430
What we do care about is setting up a three column layer.

09:15.970 --> 09:18.730
So first of all it's changed 992 pixels.

09:18.880 --> 09:25.420
So starting from nine hundred ninety two I would like to change it not to 50 percent but thirty three

09:25.750 --> 09:30.960
point three three three because I would like to have a record layer.

09:31.000 --> 09:31.960
All right.

09:32.110 --> 09:38.290
Let's head over back and sure enough we do have our three column layout and once we have this three

09:38.290 --> 09:43.810
column layout the last thing that I would like to cover is in fact this side by side effect because

09:43.810 --> 09:51.340
notice that once we get to in fact eleven hundred and seventy pixels in fact not only we have a three

09:51.340 --> 09:57.880
column layout where the icon is sitting on the top and then we have a text as well as we have this little

09:57.880 --> 10:03.670
information about the service but we also change it around a little bit where we use the fact that of

10:03.670 --> 10:05.340
course we can use the Flex box.

10:05.470 --> 10:10.230
Now this is really optional if you like of course you can just leave your three come out.

10:10.300 --> 10:15.460
You don't have to do this side by side effect but since we are covering flex box I thought that I would

10:15.460 --> 10:19.000
like to show you how we can of course do this side by side effect.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.950
Now the reason why I'm doing this on a bigger screen size because in my opinion you need to have a room.

10:24.430 --> 10:26.050
So it looks somewhat decent.

10:26.170 --> 10:26.790
OK.

10:26.800 --> 10:31.490
If you're doing this on a small screen size I believe it doesn't look very good.

10:31.510 --> 10:37.990
So that's the reason why I like to keep this layout with icon on top on a small screen size and only

10:37.990 --> 10:40.920
once I get to eleven hundred and seventy.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.040
That's when I flip it around.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.400
Now how do we do that.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.900
Well first of all we're going to have to set up a mirror query.

10:48.070 --> 10:53.410
So again just because it's a little bit easier for me to park copy everything I'm just gonna copy everything

10:53.800 --> 10:57.260
then I'm going to leave this one blank for an hour to service.

10:57.330 --> 11:02.450
But let's just change the values let's say eleven hundred and seventy pixels.

11:02.490 --> 11:02.720
Right.

11:03.030 --> 11:10.440
And remember that was our max with to begin with for our services center for our generic class.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.370
Now what we would like to do.

11:12.790 --> 11:16.240
Well we have this service class correct.

11:16.330 --> 11:22.170
We have the whole service class and that includes the icon as well as the div.

11:22.210 --> 11:26.590
Now as we're looking at it we notice that we have two children correct.

11:26.590 --> 11:28.000
So one is icon.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.890
And the second child is this div.

11:29.890 --> 11:33.010
Now this particular div has two items in it as well.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.080
So heading for Bud and the paragraph.

11:36.280 --> 11:43.840
However please keep in mind since we're working with our service class with our article as far as this

11:43.840 --> 11:48.070
particular article is concerned it only has two children.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.380
Now we would like to set them side by side.

11:50.470 --> 11:51.640
So what do we do.

11:51.780 --> 11:56.160
Well we do a display flux and that's number one.

11:56.370 --> 11:57.550
And let's check it out.

11:57.640 --> 11:58.910
What will be the change.

11:58.960 --> 11:59.950
And this is what we got.

12:00.370 --> 12:02.810
So we have icon on the left hand side.

12:02.830 --> 12:07.880
And now we have our text and as well as our paragraph here on the right hand side.

12:08.350 --> 12:09.250
OK.

12:09.310 --> 12:11.020
That's a good start.

12:11.380 --> 12:14.830
Now why don't we align everything on the left hand side.

12:14.830 --> 12:20.860
Because remember when we were working with our services in general we just set everything in a center.

12:20.890 --> 12:26.940
So what I would like to do right now is just set up everything text on line and I'm going to say left.

12:27.630 --> 12:30.280
So I'm going to move all my text to the left.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.250
And then there's still some issues here.

12:32.430 --> 12:36.260
But don't worry we're gonna fix them literally in a second.

12:36.450 --> 12:42.780
But now what I would like to do is as we see for our icon since our default is stretch.

12:42.780 --> 12:50.580
Remember when we set something to a flex or the parent our items by default we're stretch but what I

12:50.580 --> 12:56.970
would like to do is have my icon here sitting all the way on the top like so.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.910
So it's not stretched and the way we do that is by targeting in fact our icon.

13:02.910 --> 13:13.290
So let's write service icon and remember since it is a child we can just apply a line self and instead

13:13.290 --> 13:19.660
of in fact aligning it by having it as a stretch I'm going to go would start.

13:19.680 --> 13:23.710
So first of all I would like to align it all the way on top.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.340
So I'm going to go and start the model and we'll fix that.

13:26.340 --> 13:28.400
Now my icon sitting nicely on the top.

13:28.770 --> 13:36.510
So it's not any more stretched all the way to a with or I'm sorry the height I guess with another flex

13:36.510 --> 13:43.470
box child then I would like to have a little bit of padding for the service in full and I'm going to

13:43.470 --> 13:45.750
go with one arms.

13:45.900 --> 13:48.210
So we're going to do it this way.

13:48.210 --> 13:57.890
Service in full and for my info I'm going to set it up a padding left and we're going to set it as one

13:57.900 --> 14:00.140
arms not said that one.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.360
So now we have a little bit padding left.

14:02.780 --> 14:08.670
And now as far as service title I would like to add a little bit of margin in the bottom.

14:08.690 --> 14:12.120
So I'm going to go with zero point five arms.

14:12.680 --> 14:22.120
So let's set this up as margin bottom and like so zero point five are yams.

14:22.140 --> 14:23.640
And last but not least.

14:23.640 --> 14:29.370
Why don't we work with this text because first of all I'd like to remove any kind of margins from my

14:29.370 --> 14:33.450
text and have some kind of with for text as well.

14:33.450 --> 14:39.590
So the text that a class of service text.

14:39.800 --> 14:47.020
Now first of all let's add some kind of with let's say with is going to be 90 percent in this case.

14:47.090 --> 14:50.120
And last but not least I don't want any kind of margins.

14:50.270 --> 14:53.480
So I'm going to go with margins zero all around.

14:53.480 --> 14:59.150
And when we do that we have this particular layout where there is going to be some margin because we

14:59.150 --> 15:07.490
have it on the title but then text is just sitting here splash with a side of my service in full.

15:07.820 --> 15:09.420
And this is 90 percent.

15:09.650 --> 15:10.880
That's how we can create.

15:10.880 --> 15:17.540
In fact this side by side layout on a bigger screen size if we would like to do so successfully we have

15:17.540 --> 15:23.330
created our services section and next to not there's going to be a feature towards section.
