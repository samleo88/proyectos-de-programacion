1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,140
Alright, guys. What we're going to be

2

00:00:01,140  -->  00:00:02,879
doing in this video is actually making a

3

00:00:02,879  -->  00:00:05,040
pie chart. So let's go ahead and erase

4

00:00:05,040  -->  00:00:06,629
everything we've got here because it's

5

00:00:06,629  -->  00:00:07,919
going to be an entirely different chart

6

00:00:07,919  -->  00:00:10,139
that we're making. The labels that we

7

00:00:10,139  -->  00:00:16,350
want to use, we're going to use sicknesses or

8

00:00:16,350  -->  00:00:18,840
something, let's make a graph of how many

9

00:00:18,840  -->  00:00:22,769
people work in different professions, I

10

00:00:22,769  -->  00:00:27,779
guess. So the labels are going to be, it's

11

00:00:27,779  -->  00:00:36,630
going to be strings, so how many

12

00:00:36,630  -->  00:00:40,110
people in the technology industry...

13

00:00:40,110  -->  00:00:42,570
programming languages let's use that. How

14

00:00:42,570  -->  00:00:44,730
many people in the technology or

15

00:00:44,730  -->  00:00:47,489
programming industry use what type of

16

00:00:47,489  -->  00:00:49,890
programming language. So, let's start with

17

00:00:49,890  -->  00:01:07,170
Python, C++, Ruby, Java, PHP, and Pearl. I

18

00:01:07,170  -->  00:01:11,640
can't remember if they spell pearl like

19

00:01:11,640  -->  00:01:14,430
this or with the a. I think it's like

20

00:01:14,430  -->  00:01:15,930
this but I really don't remember seeing

21

00:01:15,930  -->  00:01:19,200
that any time recently. Alright, and

22

00:01:19,200  -->  00:01:21,960
then we're going to make the sizes of

23

00:01:21,960  -->  00:01:25,560
each one, so this is going to be a list,

24

00:01:25,560  -->  00:01:28,500
and again you can name the variables

25

00:01:28,500  -->  00:01:30,030
whatever you want to just make sure that

26

00:01:30,030  -->  00:01:31,409
what it's time to use them to actually

27

00:01:31,409  -->  00:01:33,540
build the graph that you reference the

28

00:01:33,540  -->  00:01:36,479
correct variables. So Python let's say

29

00:01:36,479  -->  00:01:39,900
there's let's say 10,000 people were, well

30

00:01:39,900  -->  00:01:41,549
let's just say a bunch of people were

31

00:01:41,549  -->  00:01:44,850
surveyed and they gave us these numbers.

32

00:01:44,850  -->  00:02:00,630
So, 33, 52, 12, 17, and I need six different digits, or six different

33

00:02:00,630  -->  00:02:08,069
integers. I need two more so let's say 62 and 48.

34

00:02:08,069  -->  00:02:10,530
So there's my numbers that correspond to

35

00:02:10,530  -->  00:02:12,840
each one of these values,

36

00:02:12,840  -->  00:02:14,760
and how we're going to actually put that

37

00:02:14,760  -->  00:02:18,720
into a pie chart is we're just going to

38

00:02:18,720  -->  00:02:29,040
say plt.pie, and then we're going to pass

39

00:02:29,040  -->  00:02:38,910
in sizes, labels=labels. Now we

40

00:02:38,910  -->  00:02:41,310
should be able to run the plt.show,

41

00:02:41,310  -->  00:02:45,239
and then run the chart and we do see a

42

00:02:45,239  -->  00:02:47,640
basic pie chart, but one interesting

43

00:02:47,640  -->  00:02:49,410
thing is that you'll notice it stretches

44

00:02:49,410  -->  00:02:54,150
from a pie to more of a an egg shape. So,

45

00:02:54,150  -->  00:02:58,260
the way that we fix that

46

00:02:58,260  -->  00:03:01,410
is basically by setting the axis to

47

00:03:01,410  -->  00:03:14,819
equal, so plt.axis, there we go, set it to

48

00:03:14,819  -->  00:03:17,579
equal, and when we run the chart now

49

00:03:17,579  -->  00:03:19,920
you'll see that it always stays in the

50

00:03:19,920  -->  00:03:22,410
same aspect ratio, so it always looks

51

00:03:22,410  -->  00:03:27,000
like a pie. Now, we can do multiple things

52

00:03:27,000  -->  00:03:30,150
with this pie chart to make it easier to

53

00:03:30,150  -->  00:03:32,130
see the data that's contained within

54

00:03:32,130  -->  00:03:34,769
each one. So what we're going to do, and

55

00:03:34,769  -->  00:03:39,840
also as you'll notice it arranges

56

00:03:39,840  -->  00:03:42,599
our pie chart counterclockwise, so if

57

00:03:42,599  -->  00:03:44,549
we start up Python and we go backwards,

58

00:03:44,549  -->  00:03:47,519
then we see what we've got forwards here.

59

00:03:47,519  -->  00:03:51,419
So the first thing I want to do is the

60

00:03:51,419  -->  00:03:54,810
actual percentages from these numbers, so

61

00:03:54,810  -->  00:03:59,220
I want to know what percent exactly that

62

00:03:59,220  -->  00:04:02,250
you know each item is. So we're going to

63

00:04:02,250  -->  00:04:06,389
use the keyword argument autopct, and

64

00:04:06,389  -->  00:04:10,590
we're just going to set it to a weird

65

00:04:10,590  -->  00:04:15,189
little number, and

66

00:04:15,900  -->  00:04:18,690
I'm not sure why we use this I will have

67

00:04:18,690  -->  00:04:21,750
to find out why this works. Anyway, so if

68

00:04:21,750  -->  00:04:25,199
you restart the application it will show

69

00:04:25,199  -->  00:04:27,060
you that 14% of programmers

70

00:04:27,060  -->  00:04:29,400
use Python, or 23% percent of

71

00:04:29,400  -->  00:04:33,780
programmers use C++. Now another thing

72

00:04:33,780  -->  00:04:35,340
that you can do is you can explode

73

00:04:35,340  -->  00:04:38,789
different pieces of the pie outward. So

74

00:04:38,789  -->  00:04:40,889
if we were going to focus on Python here

75

00:04:40,889  -->  00:04:47,639
we should create a variable here called

76

00:04:47,639  -->  00:04:51,780
separated equals, and then this is going

77

00:04:51,780  -->  00:04:55,350
to be a tuple, I'm not sure how to pronounce that.

78

00:04:55,350  -->  00:04:57,510
In python it's essentially the

79

00:04:57,510  -->  00:05:00,510
same as a list but you've got brackets,

80

00:05:00,510  -->  00:05:01,590
and it's used differently in other

81

00:05:01,590  -->  00:05:03,330
contexts, but for right now we're going

82

00:05:03,330  -->  00:05:05,430
to use it as a list. So what we're going

83

00:05:05,430  -->  00:05:08,220
to do is we're going to, this is going to

84

00:05:08,220  -->  00:05:11,280
take the same amount of items as our

85

00:05:11,280  -->  00:05:13,919
list, and the same amount of items as our

86

00:05:13,919  -->  00:05:17,130
labels, we're just going to set zero for

87

00:05:17,130  -->  00:05:18,570
the pieces that we want to be intact,

88

00:05:18,570  -->  00:05:21,599
and then a different number for the

89

00:05:21,599  -->  00:05:25,320
items that we want to be separated. So in

90

00:05:25,320  -->  00:05:27,449
this case we want Python to be separated

91

00:05:27,449  -->  00:05:30,060
so we're going to set that to 1, and

92

00:05:30,060  -->  00:05:33,300
then every other number is going to be

93

00:05:33,300  -->  00:05:37,590
equal to 0. And then the keyword argument

94

00:05:37,590  -->  00:05:42,449
here is explode. So you can see this and

95

00:05:42,449  -->  00:05:44,610
run this again, and you're going to

96

00:05:44,610  -->  00:05:46,740
see that Python is way out here, but we

97

00:05:46,740  -->  00:05:48,570
can make it actually closer by using a

98

00:05:48,570  -->  00:05:52,380
float under one, so let's say .1

99

00:05:52,380  -->  00:05:54,930
rather than 1, and it's going to make

100

00:05:54,930  -->  00:05:57,690
it closer into the pie itself. So you can

101

00:05:57,690  -->  00:05:59,639
actually explode this in different ways

102

00:05:59,639  -->  00:06:04,560
if we wanted this to have .3, 0, and

103

00:06:04,560  -->  00:06:06,599
this one would be 0 as well, and then

104

00:06:06,599  -->  00:06:10,830
.6. So, if we run this our pie

105

00:06:10,830  -->  00:06:12,120
is going to look all messed up like

106

00:06:12,120  -->  00:06:17,190
everyone's had a little piece of it. So

107

00:06:17,190  -->  00:06:19,740
that's a very basic pie chart, and I

108

00:06:19,740  -->  00:06:21,030
think we're going to be exploring this a

109

00:06:21,030  -->  00:06:24,320
bit further in the next video as well.
