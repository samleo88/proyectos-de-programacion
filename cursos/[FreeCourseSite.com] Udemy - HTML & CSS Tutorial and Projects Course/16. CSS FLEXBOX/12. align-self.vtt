00:00.280 --> 00:01.090
Beautiful.

00:01.140 --> 00:06.270
Next why don't we take a look at online self property now in order to do that.

00:06.270 --> 00:09.480
I'm going to make some changes to my tutorial.

00:09.480 --> 00:16.170
First of all let's add old of height so let's say 300 pixels is going to do it.

00:16.220 --> 00:17.580
That's number one.

00:17.580 --> 00:24.720
Then let's go with Flex and the property that I'm going to be looking for is in fact going to be a line

00:24.720 --> 00:25.260
items.

00:25.490 --> 00:25.880
Yeah.

00:26.070 --> 00:29.430
I'm going to go with a line items and I'm going to line all of them.

00:29.430 --> 00:34.100
Let's say in the center and we already know that the stretch was the default one.

00:34.180 --> 00:36.690
That's why my boxes were stretched.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.980
Now what would a line self do.

00:40.350 --> 00:46.920
Well let's imagine the scenario where we have all these five boxes but I would like to move box number

00:46.920 --> 00:47.630
five.

00:47.790 --> 00:50.280
Well in a different direction some more.

00:50.640 --> 00:56.300
So I wouldn't want the box number five to sit in a center where we could simply do it like this red

00:56.310 --> 00:57.870
box five.

00:57.900 --> 00:59.300
So we're targeting that one.

00:59.430 --> 01:06.360
And then once we use align self property we can really go wild where we could start you know what I

01:06.360 --> 01:06.950
don't like it.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.120
I don't want to place box number five at the end of it and sure enough when I opened my box right now

01:12.120 --> 01:19.590
it's sitting flush with the bottom edge of my container because even though I added this a line items

01:19.920 --> 01:27.100
which if we remember was in fact affecting all my children in this case once we start working with a

01:27.200 --> 01:32.090
self we can just move our boxes our individual boxes how do we like.

01:32.250 --> 01:38.610
And Sam is going to work even if I'm going to increase the size of my container by another 200 pixels.

01:38.610 --> 01:43.800
So still this one is sitting all the way in the bottom and then of course I can also change it to a

01:43.800 --> 01:45.060
start and you name it.

01:45.420 --> 01:49.350
So essentially all the property values that we had for a client Ms.

01:49.440 --> 01:52.750
I can individually apply for each and every item.

01:52.790 --> 01:54.470
Right now the same is gonna work.

01:54.510 --> 02:02.910
If I let's say move it flex a line items to where flex and same deal rest of my boxes are sitting here

02:03.270 --> 02:08.850
and five can be individually targeted and placed let's say all the way on top.

02:08.850 --> 02:13.470
Now I'm not going to cover all of them because we have already covered these properties but just to

02:13.470 --> 02:14.510
have some fun.

02:15.140 --> 02:21.960
And once we have our selector let's write a line self and let's look for the search value the moment

02:21.960 --> 02:27.600
we do that we know is that box number three is in fact stretched all day across the container.

02:27.730 --> 02:31.330
The last one we're going to look at is going to be center.

02:31.350 --> 02:37.410
So for Box Number One Again align self let's just place it in the center.

02:37.800 --> 02:42.500
So as you can see align self allows us to individually target our items.

02:42.720 --> 02:45.600
No question probably is where we're going to use that.

02:45.600 --> 02:50.280
Well again items and elements come in different sizes.

02:50.280 --> 02:55.880
So image is going to be different than the text text is gonna be different than a button.

02:55.890 --> 03:02.010
So once you're gonna have that type of scenario this is where you're going to start experimenting with

03:02.010 --> 03:08.010
different type of values to get the layout that you would like considering that your elements are different

03:08.010 --> 03:09.900
shapes and different sizes.
