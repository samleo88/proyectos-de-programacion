WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:01.230
Sure thing.

00:01.230 --> 00:04.110
Now we know how to create external rings.

00:04.350 --> 00:05.900
What about internal.

00:06.470 --> 00:07.550
What you see at the moment.

00:07.560 --> 00:12.990
We have only one home homepage but eventually for the project let's say we're going I am the about page

00:13.000 --> 00:14.050
the contact page.

00:14.370 --> 00:19.350
So we would need to set up some kind of navigation board in order to set up the navigation we would

00:19.350 --> 00:22.930
need to have the links that would point to those pages.

00:23.010 --> 00:23.670
How do we do that.

00:24.420 --> 00:30.500
Well first of all it's great that new page said say the new page is gonna be about HCM now.

00:30.540 --> 00:33.190
Now we're you know how to create a structure.

00:33.290 --> 00:36.440
Again all going to have a simple exclamation mark.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.840
And then let's say in the title.

00:38.920 --> 00:39.270
That's right.

00:39.280 --> 00:45.030
Not document and let's say about then we're gonna know that we're navigating through about page and

00:45.030 --> 00:49.960
then right away let's create first of all link that's gonna be pointing back to the homepage.

00:49.980 --> 00:52.640
So as we know again it's going to be very simple.

00:52.740 --> 00:57.930
We just have the link and then here we're going to be pointing to somewhere now in this case we're not

00:57.930 --> 01:00.230
pointing back to the Demi.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.190
In this case we're gonna say where we would like to go and in our case we would like to go back to the

01:05.190 --> 01:05.580
homepage.

01:06.270 --> 01:12.350
So as you can see we just need to point to the correct file whereas the homepage and that's right here

01:12.360 --> 01:17.620
back to home page because that's gonna be enough.

01:17.670 --> 01:24.370
I also like to remind you or to show you that we can write anything within the link.

01:24.470 --> 01:26.340
What's important is the atrium.

01:26.870 --> 01:33.100
So regardless of what we write over here we're gonna be navigating to whatever we're pointing to.

01:33.110 --> 01:33.760
We're nature.

01:34.340 --> 01:39.050
So just because we're saying here let's say God you Demi doesn't mean that we're gonna go to you Demi

01:39.620 --> 01:46.160
This is just gonna be text that's being rendered not once we have our about h the email set up we'll

01:46.160 --> 01:52.130
head over back to indexation email and maybe somewhere on the top the image again we're going to create

01:52.130 --> 01:53.170
a new link.

01:53.390 --> 01:57.770
And in this case we're gonna be navigating to about HMO.

01:58.010 --> 02:05.180
So within the home page we're going to be pointing to about page on let's say about age or just about

02:05.340 --> 02:07.140
IS GONNA BE GOOD ENOUGH.

02:07.140 --> 02:08.320
NOW LET'S SAVE THIS.

02:08.360 --> 02:15.440
AND SURE ENOUGH NOW I HAVE MY LINK now in this case if I'm gonna click on the about notice I'm navigating

02:15.680 --> 02:21.020
through the about page since I know that first of all the title's different as well as I have my link

02:21.650 --> 02:26.890
and if I'm gonna click on the web page then I'm going to navigate back to the homepage.

02:26.930 --> 02:31.340
So this is how we set up links internally within our project.
