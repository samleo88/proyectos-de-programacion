WEBVTT

00:00.510 --> 00:01.450
All right all right.

00:01.450 --> 00:02.350
I have the folder.

00:02.380 --> 00:05.150
But how do we create our first web page now.

00:05.200 --> 00:09.910
First of all let me just make this bigger again so we can see everything that's happening.

00:09.910 --> 00:15.520
Now second it's easy to see that everything is in very small phones and like I said we will gonna fix

00:15.520 --> 00:16.300
this later.

00:16.420 --> 00:21.310
But just to give you a tip whenever you're working again with Visual Studio code you're going to have

00:21.310 --> 00:28.570
the option of zooming in as you can see right now if I'm press in command and plus or minus I'm zooming

00:28.570 --> 00:34.910
in more I'm zooming out I'm gonna zoom in so we can see really clearly what we're doing but we all gonna

00:34.930 --> 00:39.690
fix this in the next video and we're going to start working with our settings now first and foremost.

00:39.690 --> 00:41.490
We're going to have to create a file.

00:41.620 --> 00:43.550
Now again we have few options.

00:43.780 --> 00:46.460
As you notice here we have a little icon.

00:46.600 --> 00:52.540
And when I'm hovering over it it says that we can create new file or there's another option where we

00:52.540 --> 00:54.600
just right click it on the sidebar.

00:54.760 --> 00:56.530
And again we have multiple options.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.890
And what we're interested that is new file regardless.

00:59.890 --> 01:04.550
The result is gonna be exactly the same that we can create a new file.

01:04.550 --> 01:08.660
Now I want to call my file my first file indexed HDMI.

01:09.140 --> 01:11.420
And both of these things are important.

01:11.450 --> 01:17.670
It's important to call this index as well as it is important to have this extension of HDMI.

01:17.720 --> 01:23.090
Now the reason for HD The Amal extension because there's gonna be different files there's gonna be maybe

01:23.150 --> 01:28.040
not maybe there's actually going to be assessed files later on there's gonna be some JavaScript files

01:28.040 --> 01:29.210
and all kinds of files.

01:29.720 --> 01:33.960
So this tells the browser of what type of file this is gonna be.

01:33.980 --> 01:39.710
Now second the index is important because whenever you're going to download your project or upload your

01:39.710 --> 01:43.170
project on the server this is gonna be your homepage.

01:43.280 --> 01:48.800
So if you're going to home page this is gonna be indexation email if you're gonna have an about page

01:48.800 --> 01:54.980
or contact me page you name this however you'd like but your homepage will going to have to be index

01:55.030 --> 01:56.270
H to email.

01:56.420 --> 02:01.970
Now on the right hand side like I said this would be the space we're all going to be doing all our work

02:02.360 --> 02:04.170
which would be our workspace.

02:04.160 --> 02:10.220
Now since we know that h the email is made up of elements let's create our first two elements and again

02:10.220 --> 02:15.980
we will cover them in bigger detail later on let's just get up and running with our first webpage.

02:16.490 --> 02:18.810
So first of all I would like to have a heading one.

02:19.170 --> 02:22.580
And again the syntax was the opening tag and closing.

02:22.850 --> 02:25.270
Now what's gonna happen with Visual Studio code.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.820
This will automatically to create the closing tag for us.

02:28.910 --> 02:30.080
So we don't need to worry about.

02:30.560 --> 02:35.660
So here I'm gonna say hello world and then let's also add maybe a paragraph.

02:35.660 --> 02:41.690
And again we have an option of just creating the paragraph tags or paragraph element and I'm going to

02:41.680 --> 02:45.920
say this is my first web page.

02:45.920 --> 02:52.700
And again please don't worry I'm gonna go over detail what these things mean in the later videos but

02:52.700 --> 02:55.840
just for now let's get up and running with our first web page.

02:56.030 --> 03:01.220
Now as you noticed right away you have this one as well as you have this little circle here.

03:01.220 --> 03:06.340
Now what this says that you haven't saved the file and again if you would like to save the file you

03:06.340 --> 03:11.980
have two options you can head over to the file and then we can just click on Save as well as it tells

03:11.980 --> 03:15.140
us right away the shortcut which would be commanders.

03:15.160 --> 03:20.200
So either you just press on the file more command less and now we're gonna save the file.

03:20.890 --> 03:23.140
So how do we look at our first webpage.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.960
Well we're going to have to navigate again back to our folder project again.

03:27.990 --> 03:32.750
Call this however you like and notice right now you have this index actually in my file.

03:33.340 --> 03:38.620
However it has this little like on right next to and maybe in your operating system the icon might be

03:38.620 --> 03:43.690
different but the general idea is that we can open up this file in the browser.

03:43.690 --> 03:44.720
So how do we do that.

03:45.100 --> 03:50.590
First of all we can just double click or we have an option of right clicking and noticed it says well

03:50.710 --> 03:56.460
open with more since we already set it up the Google Chrome this is going to open up as a default browser

03:56.840 --> 04:00.430
but the same way would work if you would have a different default browser.

04:00.430 --> 04:04.690
I'm just gonna double click this and this is going to open up in your default browser.

04:05.020 --> 04:08.410
So again since in our case both of them are exactly the same.

04:08.560 --> 04:11.410
It would have the same result regardless.

04:11.500 --> 04:15.920
And sure enough now I have a low world and this is my first web page.

04:15.940 --> 04:19.000
Now again this is not most sophisticated webpage.

04:19.030 --> 04:24.550
However this is a job well done since we created our first web page successfully.
