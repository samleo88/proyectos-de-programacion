WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:04.080
Okay so we have our aged here male 40 about S..

00:04.080 --> 00:05.420
How about safe sex.

00:05.620 --> 00:07.540
I think we can start working on it.

00:07.730 --> 00:17.130
And here again we're gonna do the same while Dale was gonna say bow section or just about and we can

00:17.130 --> 00:21.280
copy and paste it and off about and let's start adding now.

00:21.660 --> 00:24.110
The first style technically is gonna be the global one.

00:24.300 --> 00:25.900
And this is gonna be really up to you.

00:25.950 --> 00:29.930
You want to keep it in the About section or you can keep it in global.

00:29.940 --> 00:32.370
Well first of all you need to work on and like I said.

00:32.370 --> 00:39.120
The reason for this is because there is gonna be a section underclass and this is gonna be used for

00:39.180 --> 00:42.860
our land and not only in this section but in few other.

00:43.360 --> 00:48.600
No way they the way this is gonna work I'm gonna say section and we're looking for the class of center

00:49.110 --> 00:51.090
and I would like to add some padding.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.990
Now one thing that's gonna be annoying right now that you're not going to be able to see anything because

00:54.990 --> 00:56.860
of the actual image.

00:56.910 --> 01:03.210
So let me first add the padding and then you'll see that there is gonna be padding but this image is

01:03.210 --> 01:05.630
quite district so why don't we do this.

01:05.640 --> 01:12.480
I know that there is gonna be a picture image of about picture class was for image and I'm just like

01:12.480 --> 01:18.990
to add right now with 100 percent as well as the display block on display block at the moment is not

01:18.990 --> 01:24.870
necessary but I just find it easier if we can see everything that we're doing instead of this massive

01:24.870 --> 01:28.090
image so let me write again this play.

01:28.090 --> 01:34.680
BLOCK And now we're not gonna have this annoying margin in the bottom back to the sections and so now

01:34.680 --> 01:38.870
I'm adding the padding top and bottom as well.

01:39.230 --> 01:43.970
Remember that this is for all the sections that we're gonna be using whatever we're gonna be using Section

01:43.980 --> 01:44.300
Sander.

01:44.300 --> 01:45.650
This is gonna happen.

01:45.650 --> 01:52.040
And here I would like to have some kind of width so let's say with it is going to be like 80 view with

01:52.640 --> 01:54.500
as well as I would like to use.

01:54.530 --> 01:56.420
And you know what I didn't delete it.

01:56.510 --> 01:58.510
Now this is gonna be a review with.

01:58.670 --> 02:05.180
However since we're dealing with the screen a percentage of the screen I also would like to set it up

02:05.180 --> 02:06.950
the max with something to say.

02:06.950 --> 02:11.430
This should not get bigger than 11 hundred and seventy pixels.

02:11.430 --> 02:16.250
Now this is the reason as we're looking at the finished project that even if I'm gonna make this bigger

02:16.700 --> 02:22.970
the sections is let's say about section product section and here to contact session all of them are

02:22.970 --> 02:26.420
gonna have the same layout because we're using this section center.

02:26.420 --> 02:27.930
That's the whole reason behind.

02:28.490 --> 02:34.740
Now we also would like to place it always in the center and we have an option of margin zero.

02:34.750 --> 02:35.370
No no no.

02:35.780 --> 02:38.520
So this way our section is gonna be in center.

02:38.720 --> 02:43.760
And technically as you're looking at it you're like I don't know does this really affect.

02:43.760 --> 02:48.640
Yeah it does affect it does affect you even though we cannot see clearly maybe let's say background

02:48.650 --> 02:55.500
red or anything like that but it does affect our layout and you'll see how much more beneficial it is.

02:55.610 --> 02:58.440
Again you can keep this in the adult section.

02:58.610 --> 03:06.560
What I'm gonna do do is I'm gonna get it to a global because in theory at least this is a global one

03:06.830 --> 03:10.490
because we're using it throughout multiple sections.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.330
Again it's not really a big deal.

03:12.350 --> 03:17.120
You can keep it in about but in some cases might be where you're like looking for it and you're like

03:17.480 --> 03:21.980
OK now I need to remember which section it was in so where I had to see ss.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.100
Is that like a deal breaker.

03:24.110 --> 03:25.720
Depends how big is your project.

03:25.730 --> 03:28.770
Probably the bigger the project the harder it's going to be look for it.

03:28.780 --> 03:29.130
OK.

03:29.300 --> 03:33.800
So what else we have after the picture where you're not before the picture.

03:33.810 --> 03:36.040
Let's work on these two columns.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.370
Now what was the columns.

03:37.370 --> 03:39.700
One was about image the article.

03:39.860 --> 03:41.670
And second one was they are blocked in front.

03:41.800 --> 03:46.520
Now what I would like to do right now is just add some kind of margin or I'm sorry padding in between

03:46.520 --> 03:52.490
them because right now I have the image that would be about image and then I have this about our station

03:52.910 --> 03:54.710
that's gonna be already in full.

03:54.830 --> 04:00.590
So what I will do over here is I'm going to say about class and the class name was the image then comma.

04:00.590 --> 04:07.400
So I'd like to select two of them about info and for both of them let's add some padding top bottom

04:07.400 --> 04:10.500
is going to be to our arms and left all right there's gonna be zero.

04:10.590 --> 04:12.450
Now I was gonna have some padding in between.

04:13.100 --> 04:17.810
Okay so let's start working with this container because like I said there's gonna be some things that

04:17.810 --> 04:21.300
I want to do with an image but I do want to have the container.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.880
So first of all let's start working with a background.

04:25.220 --> 04:32.080
So let's say about that was the container picture glass container.

04:32.150 --> 04:36.740
And let's add some background now the background is gonna be primary color and I can tell you right

04:36.740 --> 04:40.260
away if everything is correct you're not gonna be able to see this color.

04:40.540 --> 04:45.880
So let must have it and everything is correct and we cannot see how or if we remove this block.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.400
Now this was gonna happen.

04:47.490 --> 04:52.000
There is gonna be this green color and there is the reasoning for this madness.

04:52.040 --> 04:58.090
Now let me again on come on this and now I can see the call also I would like to have some water some

04:58.080 --> 05:04.550
would say border zero point five or M So how thick is the border zero point five.

05:04.550 --> 05:06.040
What is the type solid.

05:06.230 --> 05:12.350
And then we're gonna be looking again for the primary color primary color is it gonna be our color.

05:12.350 --> 05:14.540
So now we're adding nice border all around.

05:14.750 --> 05:21.600
Also we'd like to have a little bit of border radius border radius and then we're looking for one area.

05:21.690 --> 05:26.780
I was gonna leave a comment that there is gonna be an awful but maybe for now I'm not gonna add it just

05:26.780 --> 05:32.810
so we can kind of make a mistake and then once we're gonna fix it then we're gonna figure out what is

05:32.810 --> 05:33.850
the mistake.

05:33.850 --> 05:35.980
Now let me say that this is going to be awful.

05:36.290 --> 05:39.730
And so far this is what I'm having with my container.

05:39.950 --> 05:43.600
I do want to add a little bit different setup for the picture.

05:44.090 --> 05:46.000
So first I would like to have some transitioning.

05:46.340 --> 05:51.740
So as I'm hovering I would like to make this picture big and I know that already for this I can do the

05:51.740 --> 05:52.780
transitioning.

05:52.850 --> 05:59.180
We already have the variable main transitioning like we had already before and now let's set up the

05:59.180 --> 06:06.940
hovering color it is important that hovering is going to happen as I'm hovering over the container because

06:06.940 --> 06:08.890
the container is the parent container.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.590
Let me find it here.

06:11.620 --> 06:15.010
We have the parent container and then we have our image.

06:15.040 --> 06:19.150
What I want is as I'm hovering over again this parent container.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.610
Then some changes are gonna be applied today.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.170
Oh this is gonna work.

06:23.330 --> 06:30.280
Well we're gonna say and we already have covered this about picture that was a name and we're looking

06:30.280 --> 06:34.020
for a container that has them hovering over this container.

06:34.030 --> 06:39.700
I would like to do something to this import picture now that something is gonna be first of all transformation

06:40.150 --> 06:42.580
and this name means to us they match.

06:42.580 --> 06:45.510
So here I just had a misspelling so this wouldn't work.

06:45.790 --> 06:49.600
And then we're gonna say first of all opacity is gonna go to zero point five.

06:50.050 --> 06:51.250
So what's gonna happen.

06:51.250 --> 06:57.270
Well we were all gonna be making the image more transparent and you'll see what's gonna happen as we're

06:57.280 --> 07:00.630
doing as well as we would like to transform it a little bit.

07:01.210 --> 07:02.530
And we're gonna say again scaling.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.730
So we're gonna make this bigger.

07:03.730 --> 07:09.910
X and y direction by one point to what do you think is going to happen right now as I'm hovering over

07:09.910 --> 07:11.670
the container notice.

07:11.690 --> 07:15.120
Well there's one nice thing that's working and what.

07:15.150 --> 07:20.500
But now the nice thing we can already see that there is some kind of background not a bad thing is that

07:21.310 --> 07:26.860
the image is obviously getting bigger even though we want that we don't want to make it bigger than

07:26.860 --> 07:27.670
the actual container.

07:28.060 --> 07:30.440
So this is the reason why we're using here overflow.

07:30.610 --> 07:32.160
And then we have the value of it.

07:32.590 --> 07:37.550
Now what's gonna happen is as I'm hovering the image is gonna get bigger within the container.

07:37.570 --> 07:41.590
So it's not going to be overflowing but we're also having this nice background.

07:41.590 --> 07:44.550
So even though in the beginning we were not able to see the background.

07:44.610 --> 07:47.040
You're like well why is this do it out in the background.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.640
There's no real difference.

07:48.640 --> 07:54.770
What I want is as I'm hovering I can change the opacity of the image so the image becomes more transparent.

07:54.910 --> 07:56.500
And now it can see the color.

07:56.530 --> 07:59.620
So that was the whole reasoning behind this man.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.560
Then we have again the global.

08:01.630 --> 08:06.820
This would be the section title and we can write it he is here or I'm just gonna head over right away

08:06.820 --> 08:13.900
to my Global's and we're gonna add these tiles because again I do think that since we're gonna be reusing

08:14.620 --> 08:18.580
all throughout the different sections we might as well write them into global.

08:19.000 --> 08:28.980
So here we have section dash subtitle title subtitle title and then for the subtitle 1 First of all

08:28.990 --> 08:35.820
font size I yams so the fans are going to be bigger font family I would want slanted so fun family is

08:35.820 --> 08:42.750
gonna be the slanted variable so not secondary color and I'm getting secondary color anyway so I'd want

08:42.780 --> 08:46.740
a slanted next and that's gonna be my fun family.

08:46.740 --> 08:48.420
Also one some letter spacing.

08:48.420 --> 08:52.220
Now what was our typical letter spacing that we had in our variable.

08:52.350 --> 08:54.600
So that's what it can be getting.

08:54.750 --> 09:02.280
I also would want some text transformation text transform capitalized as well as we're gonna add some

09:02.280 --> 09:08.300
different color so we say color is gonna be primary so primary color.

09:08.500 --> 09:12.370
And yeah this is gonna be our subtitle what's gonna be with the title.

09:12.390 --> 09:13.550
This is gonna be a little bit easier.

09:14.820 --> 09:20.240
We'll just gonna add section title and then here we're gonna be looking for what.

09:20.760 --> 09:25.290
Well we're gonna have fun size sized answers to our.

09:25.350 --> 09:29.160
So fans are gonna be a little bit bigger and Tex transform uppercase.

09:29.160 --> 09:35.240
Let me scroll down a little with maybe you can see better than uh Tex transform and was gonna transform

09:35.240 --> 09:36.210
it uppercase.

09:36.210 --> 09:37.680
Now this is gonna be our title.

09:37.750 --> 09:38.260
Okay.

09:38.460 --> 09:40.270
I think this is good enough.

09:40.410 --> 09:45.990
We can head over back again to where we were working because we only have one thing that we need to

09:45.990 --> 09:51.720
work on remember that was the about text the paragraph that we added and then we're gonna start dealing

09:51.720 --> 09:56.010
again with uh responsive layout because we were gonna be floating this.

09:56.010 --> 10:00.900
I'm gonna head over again back to where I finished here and we're gonna say that there is gonna be a

10:00.900 --> 10:02.000
class.

10:02.220 --> 10:08.580
So classes are gonna be about text and for the text it's gonna be very simply we're gonna say margin

10:09.030 --> 10:12.570
is gonna be top bottom one harem and left and right zero.

10:12.720 --> 10:17.880
So we're gonna add a little bit of margin but also let's add max width because again this is gonna be

10:17.880 --> 10:20.880
the case where from and you know what I can just get her on this.

10:20.880 --> 10:25.050
We don't need to clear fix but this does not look as good as I want.

10:25.620 --> 10:32.670
So what we're gonna be having this text spread out and I think that's a better fix if we add the max

10:32.670 --> 10:36.390
with max width there's gonna be 26.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.870
And like I said before this is not a magic number.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.700
I just decided that this is gonna look better.

10:42.700 --> 10:48.640
So in this case if I'm looking at bigger screen this looks to me better than what we had before.

10:48.640 --> 10:53.430
Now let's start floating this and let's start applying some kind of values.

10:53.530 --> 11:01.540
So what I'm going to say here is that for all we need media query media and we're gonna say screen and

11:01.540 --> 11:08.890
what we can do here while we can say that media screen starting from nine hundred ninety two would say

11:08.950 --> 11:16.650
and I'm going to be starting from Maine with and let's say nine hundred ninety two pixels that's gonna

11:16.660 --> 11:24.520
be about and here what I would like to do is for both of these articles obviously for both of my columns

11:25.030 --> 11:32.800
I would like to follow them and I would want to follow them to the left with a with the 50 percent.

11:32.800 --> 11:36.400
So let's do this let's say about image.

11:36.490 --> 11:42.260
Can mean one thing and then comma and also we can do about in full.

11:42.490 --> 11:49.030
So both of the columns and let's follow them to the left first as well as let's set up the width of

11:49.060 --> 11:49.950
50 percent.

11:50.170 --> 11:53.660
Because I would want them actually side by side.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.300
Let's see in a bigger screen.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.890
I think this is gonna be a bigger better scene.

11:57.910 --> 11:58.920
Let me go back again.

11:58.930 --> 12:01.930
This would be before we get to nine hundred ninety two.

12:02.170 --> 12:08.650
But the moment we get to 992 we do have a two column layer color if you're looking at it you're like

12:08.890 --> 12:10.560
Yeah I looks okay.

12:10.570 --> 12:15.590
I mean you have two columns and you obviously don't have any kind of issues here but like I don't know

12:15.590 --> 12:20.500
what's something floating right next to it but I probably don't want them side by side.

12:21.010 --> 12:25.940
I would want to have some kind of padding or something like that and we can definitely do that.

12:26.060 --> 12:31.740
Well let's say from 990 to remember initially we gave them the pairing of two arms.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.760
Now why don't we add something here.

12:33.760 --> 12:38.770
Why don't we say that padding for both of them is gonna be two arms all around.

12:38.770 --> 12:41.370
And we know the shortcut is gonna be two arms.

12:41.370 --> 12:47.440
So what I'm saying here is all the sides is gonna have two arms all around once we say right now we

12:47.440 --> 12:50.940
have a nice planet and this is our can basically fix this.

12:51.080 --> 12:57.490
And now this is gonna look nicer where both of them as they get side by side are gonna have some kind

12:57.490 --> 12:58.020
of padding.

12:58.150 --> 13:00.550
So there's gonna be some distinction in between them.

13:00.760 --> 13:07.360
So that way we can have two column layout which is gonna look really nice exactly like we work before

13:07.370 --> 13:08.530
and the final project.

13:08.680 --> 13:11.800
And now we can move on and start working on our next section.
