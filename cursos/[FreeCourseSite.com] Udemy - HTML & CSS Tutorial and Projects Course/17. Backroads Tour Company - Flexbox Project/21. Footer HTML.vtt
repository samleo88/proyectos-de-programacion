WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:08.220
And once we have added our form in the deals section next one up we're going to work on our footer.

00:08.430 --> 00:13.810
So if we take a look at the finished project in a footer we're gonna have some links.

00:13.830 --> 00:20.550
So we're gonna be able to navigate to that particular section from the footer as well as onto some icons

00:21.150 --> 00:23.110
all the way in the bottom as well.

00:23.220 --> 00:28.800
And then a little copyright where there's gonna be some information about our company.

00:28.870 --> 00:29.410
Okay.

00:29.820 --> 00:36.960
Now let's head over back to our indexation the email then and let's copy paste like we already have

00:36.960 --> 00:43.750
done before your times and then in this case you know what we can just skip it.

00:44.100 --> 00:48.000
In a sense that we don't need to have two comments for one specific thing.

00:48.150 --> 00:50.050
Why don't we write footer.

00:50.360 --> 00:54.250
And that is going to mean that of course there's going to be a footprint here.

00:54.480 --> 01:01.440
And then right after the footer we're gonna have our JavaScript So let's write JavaScript which by the

01:01.440 --> 01:03.720
way is optional at the end of the day anyway.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.280
But I'm gonna have my comment in here.

01:06.330 --> 01:07.040
OK.

01:07.170 --> 01:11.760
Now as far as footer Well let's start by creating a footer element.

01:11.760 --> 01:17.640
So in this case we're not creating a section we're creating a footer with two classes and a section

01:18.180 --> 01:20.310
as well as the Fuhrer class.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.360
Now within a photo let's start by creating our looks.

01:23.400 --> 01:34.770
So let's create a comment let's say footer links and then let's go with a div with the class of footer

01:34.770 --> 01:38.520
links footer hyphen links.

01:38.520 --> 01:41.120
Now within this div there's gonna be bunch of links.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.050
So let's start with the first one.

01:43.140 --> 01:45.320
So I'm going to create a link now.

01:45.510 --> 01:48.000
The links are gonna be within our page.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.530
So I'm just gonna say hashtag.

01:49.530 --> 01:54.270
That means that this particular link is going to go to a certain idea.

01:54.270 --> 01:59.590
Remember that was the reason when every time we create a section we added these ideas.

01:59.610 --> 02:01.680
So if your ideas are different.

02:01.680 --> 02:05.650
Make sure that you in fact have the ideas that you are using.

02:05.730 --> 02:09.480
In my case I'm using gallery I'm using about I'm using deals now.

02:09.900 --> 02:14.300
So that's the reason when I'm creating a link I'm gonna add over here.

02:14.310 --> 02:20.760
Let's say home line means that this particular thing is gonna go home and then as well I'm gonna add

02:20.760 --> 02:24.740
class and I see a class of footer link.

02:24.810 --> 02:31.380
Now later on we're gonna add some classes as well for my javascript when we're setting up the smooth

02:31.380 --> 02:32.140
scrolling.

02:32.310 --> 02:39.090
But as far as the amount he has this concern we just need the nature of with particular ideas and then

02:39.090 --> 02:46.680
footer link class and also as a side note for our finished project actually when we're gonna have the

02:46.680 --> 02:49.630
knob bar I'm also gonna use the same links.

02:49.650 --> 02:55.140
Now I'm gonna change the classes as far as styling is concerned but the HMO I'm just going to copy and

02:55.140 --> 03:00.450
paste because I don't see the point of let's say creating a length one time and then again hard coding

03:00.450 --> 03:05.880
the second time I'm just gonna grab this footer links and then we're gonna change some classes around

03:06.180 --> 03:07.680
just to give you a heads up.

03:07.690 --> 03:07.950
Right.

03:08.460 --> 03:13.000
So let's say here home I'm gonna write that that is going to be my home length.

03:13.260 --> 03:16.380
And now let's copy and paste it four more times.

03:16.380 --> 03:24.870
One two three four and we're gonna have to change some values around so I'm going to create a multiple

03:24.870 --> 03:31.890
selector by in fact typing the old and then the click of the mouse.

03:31.890 --> 03:39.660
So now I'll have two selectors and the second one is going to be about and then let's see and then we're

03:39.660 --> 03:49.200
gonna have what we're gonna have a not home but we're gonna write services services and I didn't have

03:49.200 --> 03:56.910
my second cursor services like so then what was our sections.

03:57.030 --> 04:00.750
I believe it was featured and gallery correct.

04:00.750 --> 04:07.560
So let's remove this featured and then we're gonna have the gallery.

04:07.560 --> 04:11.880
Now the reason why I'm not using hard deals is very simple.

04:12.120 --> 04:18.840
You could technically added that just please understand that since the hard deals are so small the moment

04:18.840 --> 04:24.220
we're going to navigate to a gallery we're gonna be here anyway and then we have right away footer.

04:24.270 --> 04:26.190
So that's the way our setup works.

04:26.190 --> 04:34.040
So you could technically add the deal's idea as well here with a link but it's not particularly necessary.

04:34.080 --> 04:34.790
Okay.

04:34.950 --> 04:39.500
Now we do have these links now some everything looks really well.

04:39.630 --> 04:42.420
And then why don't we place our icons as well.

04:42.420 --> 04:46.440
So let's write for icons and then you know what.

04:46.440 --> 04:50.780
Let's start by creating a div footer icons.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.860
That is our class of course.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.710
And then within these particular links.

04:55.980 --> 05:00.820
Well first of all why don't we set up our link to begin with.

05:01.060 --> 05:02.100
Let's a link.

05:02.140 --> 05:07.740
And as far as a draft normally again you're gonna add of course your social media.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.690
But in my case I'm gonna go with the same one.

05:09.930 --> 05:10.480
OK.

05:10.630 --> 05:19.940
So I'm going to say ETP yes then call on to forward slashes dub dub dub Twitter dot com.

05:19.940 --> 05:26.810
Now normally again if you're creating a Facebook you can actually share the Facebook URL and all that.

05:26.830 --> 05:29.810
Now for your specific page I'm just gonna go with Twitter.

05:29.810 --> 05:37.250
Dot com travesty is going to open up my Twitter now what I would like to do is add a target of blank

05:37.250 --> 05:43.790
here so attribute of Target and the value of blank just so when we click on the link it's gonna open

05:43.790 --> 05:46.310
up in the new browser tab.

05:46.340 --> 05:53.610
Now let's also add a class for styling for icon like so.

05:53.670 --> 06:00.540
And then within the icon why don't we have the font awesome Facebook icon now for the social media icons

06:00.540 --> 06:01.290
we need to know right.

06:01.290 --> 06:06.250
Not F yes but f a b f a Facebook.

06:06.400 --> 06:12.780
And again of course like I said for normally Facebook you're going to have your facebook link not in

06:12.780 --> 06:13.280
my case.

06:13.290 --> 06:14.120
I have a Facebook.

06:14.130 --> 06:18.990
But like I said it opens up my Twitter page just because I have Twitter dot com.

06:19.140 --> 06:21.950
And of course I have already logged in.

06:22.530 --> 06:23.980
Now let me close that.

06:24.150 --> 06:31.440
And you know what I'm gonna do is in fact selected one 2 we're going to copy and pasted on let's just

06:31.440 --> 06:37.850
change the icons let's say the second one is actually going to be Twitter and the third one is gonna

06:37.860 --> 06:39.340
be square space.

06:39.370 --> 06:46.170
Now as far as square space the actual name is square space.

06:46.170 --> 06:47.420
That is our icon.

06:47.610 --> 06:49.770
And yes I do have my icons.

06:49.890 --> 06:53.850
And lastly right after the links I'm just gonna write.

06:53.850 --> 06:58.100
Copyright P right.

06:58.150 --> 07:00.050
Like so.

07:00.210 --> 07:06.240
And then it's going to be a paragraph with the same class copy right.

07:06.360 --> 07:10.320
And then within this paragraph why don't we write copyright.

07:10.770 --> 07:18.610
Then let's use the amount special character by saying And percent we're gonna have copy then let's say

07:18.610 --> 07:19.430
my own.

07:19.650 --> 07:26.720
And then let's just add some text so back roads and travel towards company.

07:26.730 --> 07:31.790
But of course what I can do is I can just write everything with lowercase because I'm gonna set up these

07:31.790 --> 07:41.980
styling anyway so travel and I'm going to leave only one space travel towards company and you know what.

07:41.980 --> 07:45.250
Why don't we add a span for the date.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.550
Now we're gonna use that span later on when we use javascript.

07:48.550 --> 07:54.170
But I would like to do my email setup right away where I'm gonna write span.

07:54.370 --> 08:00.970
Then let's add the I.D. with the value of date and for the time being I'm going to hardcoded now later

08:00.970 --> 08:03.210
on when we're going to set up our javascript.

08:03.310 --> 08:07.360
In fact I'm gonna use this idea to set up a dynamic here.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.500
Now what do I mean by that.

08:08.500 --> 08:12.300
Well technically right now would you start 2018 19.

08:12.300 --> 08:17.440
But what I would like to do is set up the functionality well all the time we're updating.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.350
So if let's say it's gonna be 2020.

08:20.590 --> 08:26.680
Yep then we're gonna have the current year and then right after this plan let's add a dot and ledges

08:26.680 --> 08:27.070
right.

08:27.070 --> 08:30.240
All rights reserved.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.170
Like so let's say that.

08:32.290 --> 08:33.880
And that should do it.

08:33.910 --> 08:36.110
Now we have our footer year.

08:36.470 --> 08:38.450
And next to not we're going gonna start sailing in.
