WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:01.620
All right people.

00:01.650 --> 00:06.430
Next topic is extremely important because you will practice it daily.

00:06.450 --> 00:14.250
The name of the topic will be CSX box model and since it is so important we will get some visual help.

00:14.490 --> 00:17.040
And by the way if you are falling asleep.

00:17.070 --> 00:17.910
Get up.

00:17.970 --> 00:18.840
You don't want to miss it.

00:19.290 --> 00:21.670
So see it says Box model.

00:21.970 --> 00:28.080
Now like I said we're all going to be getting some visual help so we're all going to head over to bronzer

00:28.620 --> 00:33.710
and within the browser which is going to types yes us Box model.

00:33.870 --> 00:39.730
And then instead of looking for the text I'm going to be looking for the images I'm gonna pick this

00:39.730 --> 00:40.240
image.

00:40.390 --> 00:46.660
You can pick any image that you like because pretty much there can explain the same things that I'm

00:46.660 --> 00:47.410
going to be talking about.

00:48.010 --> 00:52.370
Now I'm going to click on the image and now let's get over what's happening here.

00:52.420 --> 00:58.000
You see every time that we're working with us each and every element is going to be displayed as a box

00:58.890 --> 01:00.390
now within that box.

01:00.390 --> 01:06.180
You're going to be dealing with three properties bearing That's that great distance between the content

01:06.180 --> 01:09.750
you have in your element and the hedge.

01:09.890 --> 01:13.050
Oh here there and we're gonna have the border.

01:13.060 --> 01:18.720
That's gonna go around the element and then we're looking for the margin that's going to be the distance

01:18.900 --> 01:24.180
between let's say either at the edges of the screen or some other element.

01:24.210 --> 01:28.690
Now as always the best way is to practice with these properties.

01:28.720 --> 01:33.900
I'm gonna head over back to our document but I will gonna be switching back and forth because I think

01:33.900 --> 01:39.390
at some point maybe we're all gonna need some help here again with an image and actually looking at

01:39.390 --> 01:41.330
this visually might help us a little bit.

01:42.430 --> 01:43.900
Now back to the document.

01:44.050 --> 01:48.330
I know it might be annoying to some of you but I will going to delete this.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.850
I'm going to say blah blah blah.

01:49.850 --> 01:51.990
I would like to select everything here.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.880
We welcome to delete this.

01:53.890 --> 01:58.840
So once we delete it we're going to head over to NSA Schimmel and also we're going to do a little bit

01:58.840 --> 02:02.440
of spring cleaning since it takes like 30 seconds.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.570
I don't think you should be that annoyed by that.

02:04.850 --> 02:06.600
Now within the body what we're gonna have.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.140
I don't know.

02:07.140 --> 02:09.680
We can start by hitting one and you know what.

02:09.810 --> 02:14.170
Maybe let's make this a little bit smaller because I think it's gonna be easier for us.

02:14.410 --> 02:17.010
And here let's write some Hello.

02:17.140 --> 02:28.710
I would like to learn about it says Box model and let's add maybe some exclamation mark now that is

02:28.710 --> 02:30.160
gonna be marrying one nugget.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.560
So far so good.

02:31.560 --> 02:32.610
What about the paragraph.

02:32.850 --> 02:41.490
I don't know let's add Laura I'm 20 so there's gonna be a paragraph with some text of 20 words.

02:41.730 --> 02:43.130
So far so good.

02:43.260 --> 02:46.970
We're gonna head over back to the styles we still have our comment.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.210
Now let's start working.

02:48.210 --> 02:54.060
We had the famous CEO says Box model first let's start with having one and we're gonna add simply a

02:54.060 --> 02:55.300
color or you know what.

02:55.410 --> 02:57.000
Let's add background color.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.870
That's just gonna make a little bit more sense.

02:59.090 --> 03:03.800
And for the background we're gonna do a very pretty one which is gonna be red.

03:04.850 --> 03:05.300
OK.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.560
So far so good.

03:06.570 --> 03:12.630
Then we also have the paragraph and the paragraph is gonna be background and let's say blue.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.480
So we have to Ellen now.

03:15.480 --> 03:21.380
Like I said we all gonna have to start working with our box model within the box model what do we have.

03:21.520 --> 03:27.220
I believe we have the padding and that was one of the properties that was available to us.

03:27.880 --> 03:32.470
So if I'm going to head over back and I'm gonna say for the heading What I'm going to be looking for

03:32.470 --> 03:35.680
the padding and then notice I have a bunch of options here.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.750
Well let's start with the most basic.

03:37.860 --> 03:39.580
You're going to have padding top.

03:39.870 --> 03:44.760
Now what is going to be in the padding that we can use any kind of values we already covered.

03:44.870 --> 03:45.550
As this unit.

03:45.580 --> 03:51.580
So we should be very comfortable with let's say I don't know 30 pixels.

03:51.680 --> 03:57.980
So what do you think is gonna happen right now as I'm looking at my text and the edge of my element.

03:57.980 --> 04:00.690
Right now I'm getting this padding in between.

04:00.770 --> 04:03.620
Does that reflect what we see in the picture.

04:03.710 --> 04:09.140
So we have the padding that's gonna be around the content within the element.

04:09.140 --> 04:11.440
In this case we just add it to the top.

04:11.480 --> 04:16.510
Okay let's start out let's say padding is gonna be also on the bottom.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.980
What's happening bottom.

04:18.210 --> 04:20.370
And let's also do three picks.

04:20.920 --> 04:24.580
And we have right now the padding in between where the text ends.

04:24.800 --> 04:30.980
And again the edge of our element now maybe let's increase it and get really creative and let's say

04:30.980 --> 04:32.580
this is gonna be 60.

04:32.580 --> 04:34.990
So now I'm getting my padding with 60.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.930
I also can do padding left.

04:37.170 --> 04:39.370
Right write padding left.

04:39.890 --> 04:42.560
And in this case you know what let's do.

04:42.560 --> 04:46.250
I don't know twenty five pixels getting doesn't really matter.

04:46.250 --> 04:50.540
Now my text is being pushed here on the left hand side.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.560
I'm getting my padding as well as we are.

04:53.570 --> 04:57.990
They have padding right since we are covering pretty much top bottom left.

04:57.990 --> 05:01.040
We can also do right now within the right.

05:01.190 --> 05:02.660
I don't know how we can do 50 pixels.

05:03.230 --> 05:05.890
So now I'm pushing my padding here from my right.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.710
So this is how we can write with the padding the long way.

05:09.800 --> 05:14.000
However in the C assess we're going to have bunch of shortcuts.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.730
And now we can look at it how we can create these shortcuts with the padding so for this case we're

05:19.730 --> 05:21.040
going to use the program.

05:21.200 --> 05:27.910
So instead of writing each and every time putting top bottom putting left right we can write padding

05:28.280 --> 05:33.290
and then we need to start working with the values now right away I can tell you that this is gonna work

05:33.290 --> 05:37.660
exactly the same with the margin that we're going to look at the next video and there's also gonna be

05:37.660 --> 05:39.150
shortcuts for the border.

05:39.260 --> 05:46.880
So just as a side note now for the batting first I have an option of using the same padding all around.

05:46.880 --> 05:52.430
Now why do I use the same word now because if I'm going to write 50 pixels notice what's gonna happen

05:52.430 --> 05:53.080
with my batting.

05:53.660 --> 05:56.820
So I'm going to be getting the exact same padding all around.

05:56.840 --> 06:02.810
So if you know that you want exactly the same padding just down the number and then you're gonna be

06:02.810 --> 06:03.720
getting the value.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.640
So everything is going to be working fine.

06:05.840 --> 06:12.200
Now since I want to test out a few more options for my shortcuts I would like to first of all comment

06:12.200 --> 06:15.310
this out just so you can see that this is still valuable.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.580
But I would like to see you show you other options.

06:18.680 --> 06:23.880
Now the other option is using two values the top bottom and left and right.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.430
So how is that gonna work.

06:25.430 --> 06:29.420
I'm gonna say batting then the first value is going to be top bottom and you know what.

06:29.420 --> 06:31.130
Let me just first say it.

06:31.160 --> 06:35.930
Notice right now it's basically complaining and saying while you have a syntax error you haven't added

06:35.930 --> 06:40.940
any value but the padding basically goes back to zero ultimately.

06:41.030 --> 06:46.850
And in my case I'm going to say the first value the top bottom is going to be three pixels and left

06:46.850 --> 06:49.250
and right we're gonna have 60 pixels.

06:49.250 --> 06:50.150
Now what happens right.

06:50.690 --> 06:57.360
So I have the padding on the top three pixels bottom is also going to be 30 pixels and left and right

06:57.380 --> 07:00.660
there's gonna be 60 pixels so quite predictable.

07:00.670 --> 07:00.980
Okay.

07:01.010 --> 07:02.130
So far so good.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.000
Again let's do the same thing.

07:04.130 --> 07:05.230
Let's comment this out.

07:05.240 --> 07:10.550
We know that this is gonna be valuable option but we also have an option of checking each and every

07:10.550 --> 07:11.190
value.

07:11.210 --> 07:12.400
Now how is that gonna work.

07:12.480 --> 07:18.500
Well we're gonna write panning and now I can start looking by the first value is gonna be the top the

07:18.500 --> 07:20.540
next value is gonna be right hand side.

07:20.690 --> 07:25.760
The third value is going to be the bottom and then the fourth value would be the left hand side.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.160
All right we're here.

07:27.170 --> 07:28.070
Let's test it out.

07:28.130 --> 07:37.400
Let's say 20 pixels on a top then let's say 40 pixels on the right hand side 60 pixels on the bottom

07:38.060 --> 07:44.330
and then let's do I don't know 80 pixels or you know what 10 pixels on the left hand side.

07:44.360 --> 07:51.870
Now what do we have here I have 20 pixels predictably on the top then I have 40 here then 60 over here

07:52.230 --> 07:54.460
and the time is gonna be all the way on left hand side.

07:54.930 --> 08:01.650
Please keep in mind all of them are valid or you would need to pick whatever value you would like to

08:01.650 --> 08:03.630
use for the property.

08:03.790 --> 08:08.700
What are you going to write that there's gonna be partying all around whether there's going to be padding

08:08.700 --> 08:14.760
left and right and top and bottom Morial gonna be single handedly working with each and every dimension

08:15.330 --> 08:18.310
top right left and the bottom.

08:18.480 --> 08:25.740
And again just to cover the basics the padding is gonna be different in between or spacing in between

08:25.740 --> 08:26.370
the content.

08:26.420 --> 08:33.540
You have an element and the edge of an element and we can have more options that would be top right

08:33.780 --> 08:35.100
bottom and the left.
