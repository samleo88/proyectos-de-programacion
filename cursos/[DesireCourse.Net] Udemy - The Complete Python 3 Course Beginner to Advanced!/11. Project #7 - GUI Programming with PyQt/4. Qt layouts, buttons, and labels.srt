00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,700
Hey guys, welcome back. We are not going

2

00:00:02,700  -->  00:00:05,670
to learn more qml within this section

3

00:00:05,670  -->  00:00:08,250
just because qml is something for

4

00:00:08,250  -->  00:00:11,490
another tutorial series all on its own,

5

00:00:11,490  -->  00:00:13,769
or in another course. What we're trying to

6

00:00:13,769  -->  00:00:16,049
learn here is Python and so when we're using

7

00:00:16,049  -->  00:00:18,119
pyqt what we're going to be doing

8

00:00:18,119  -->  00:00:20,460
from here on out is programming the

9

00:00:20,460  -->  00:00:23,519
interface in Python. So, what you're

10

00:00:23,519  -->  00:00:24,990
looking at right here is the native

11

00:00:24,990  -->  00:00:29,789
calculator app of mac OS, and the reason

12

00:00:29,789  -->  00:00:31,529
you're seeing it is because we are going

13

00:00:31,529  -->  00:00:33,989
to be building a calculator. Now before

14

00:00:33,989  -->  00:00:35,309
we get to that we actually need to

15

00:00:35,309  -->  00:00:36,809
understand some other things about pyqt,

16

00:00:36,809  -->  00:00:38,280
and so the first thing we're going

17

00:00:38,280  -->  00:00:40,200
to be doing is just talking about

18

00:00:40,200  -->  00:00:43,530
different layouts that a pyqt

19

00:00:43,530  -->  00:00:46,649
application can have. So I'm going to go

20

00:00:46,649  -->  00:00:49,770
ahead and open up my pycharm here, I've

21

00:00:49,770  -->  00:00:51,059
already created a project called

22

00:00:51,059  -->  00:00:53,010
calculator because that is what we are

23

00:00:53,010  -->  00:00:56,699
going to be building coming up here. So

24

00:00:56,699  -->  00:00:59,100
what we need to do is we need to before

25

00:00:59,100  -->  00:01:00,600
we even start I want to talk about

26

00:01:00,600  -->  00:01:03,690
different layouts, and so when you create

27

00:01:03,690  -->  00:01:07,500
a pyqt app it's every widget that you

28

00:01:07,500  -->  00:01:10,890
create is just going to throw it into

29

00:01:10,890  -->  00:01:14,010
the UI. Now you can absolutely position stuff,

30

00:01:14,010  -->  00:01:16,590
so you can tell it you know where it

31

00:01:16,590  -->  00:01:18,420
should be on the screen, and that's kind of

32

00:01:18,420  -->  00:01:21,000
static, it's always going to be in that

33

00:01:21,000  -->  00:01:23,189
exact position within your application.

34

00:01:23,189  -->  00:01:27,000
So a layout is a way to basically create

35

00:01:27,000  -->  00:01:28,710
a layout. So you can create a vertical

36

00:01:28,710  -->  00:01:32,310
layout, a horizontal layout, or a grid

37

00:01:32,310  -->  00:01:34,530
layout. Now for the calculator obviously

38

00:01:34,530  -->  00:01:36,180
we're going to be using a grid, so we're

39

00:01:36,180  -->  00:01:37,619
going to cover some of the other ones

40

00:01:37,619  -->  00:01:39,180
here first so you guys can understand

41

00:01:39,180  -->  00:01:41,369
them. So the first thing we need to do is

42

00:01:41,369  -->  00:01:42,990
make some imports so we're going to

43

00:01:42,990  -->  00:01:47,340
import sys for the system-level

44

00:01:47,340  -->  00:01:49,890
operations, and then we're going to be

45

00:01:49,890  -->  00:01:54,570
including some pyqt widgets that

46

00:01:54,570  -->  00:01:56,759
we're going to be using here. So, go ahead

47

00:01:56,759  -->  00:02:04,200
and type from PyQt5.QtWidgets

48

00:02:04,200  -->  00:02:08,399
import. In here what we're going to want

49

00:02:08,399  -->  00:02:09,690
right now we're just going to import a

50

00:02:09,690  -->  00:02:12,380
few that we're actually going to be using. So,

51

00:02:12,380  -->  00:02:16,460
we're going to import QWidget, obviously,

52

00:02:16,460  -->  00:02:19,370
QApplication, these two are essential

53

00:02:19,370  -->  00:02:22,100
just to get the application to run, and

54

00:02:22,100  -->  00:02:25,640
then we're going to import some layouts so

55

00:02:25,640  -->  00:02:31,100
QHBoxLayout and QVBoxLayout, and then

56

00:02:31,100  -->  00:02:36,380
also QPushButton. So those are our

57

00:02:36,380  -->  00:02:39,260
imports. Now, something you'll notice that

58

00:02:39,260  -->  00:02:41,240
I want to cover right now is that this

59

00:02:41,240  -->  00:02:44,060
line will end up getting really, really, really long, and

60

00:02:44,060  -->  00:02:45,890
so what you're going to want to do is

61

00:02:45,890  -->  00:02:47,900
use multiple lines there. So the way

62

00:02:47,900  -->  00:02:49,610
you're going to do that for an import is

63

00:02:49,610  -->  00:02:54,770
wrap all of the imports in brackets, and

64

00:02:54,770  -->  00:02:56,210
then you can split it up into multiple

65

00:02:56,210  -->  00:02:58,970
lines until it looks right. This is going

66

00:02:58,970  -->  00:03:01,070
to keep the import statement all as one.

67

00:03:01,070  -->  00:03:05,540
So now down here we're going to actually

68

00:03:05,540  -->  00:03:09,320
create our window that we're going to be

69

00:03:09,320  -->  00:03:11,420
working with, or this is the main widget.

70

00:03:11,420  -->  00:03:13,940
So let's go ahead and create a class

71

00:03:13,940  -->  00:03:19,250
called main window, and the main window

72

00:03:19,250  -->  00:03:21,200
class that we're creating is going to

73

00:03:21,200  -->  00:03:26,930
inherit from the QWidget class. Now

74

00:03:26,930  -->  00:03:28,430
we need to set the initialization

75

00:03:28,430  -->  00:03:30,620
function and this is going to basically

76

00:03:30,620  -->  00:03:32,480
run all of our code as soon as this

77

00:03:32,480  -->  00:03:35,390
initializes. So, go ahead and define the

78

00:03:35,390  -->  00:03:40,430
init function, and now we're going to

79

00:03:40,430  -->  00:03:44,270
initialize the parent, which is a QWidget

80

00:03:44,270  -->  00:03:45,920
class here, so let's go ahead and type

81

00:03:45,920  -->  00:03:51,920
super which is a method, and then init.

82

00:03:51,920  -->  00:03:58,580
Now once the qwidget is initialized

83

00:03:58,580  -->  00:04:01,940
within our main window class, what we're

84

00:04:01,940  -->  00:04:03,860
going to have to do is call a function,

85

00:04:03,860  -->  00:04:05,720
we could put all our code right in here but

86

00:04:05,720  -->  00:04:09,890
in an effort to make this more readable

87

00:04:09,890  -->  00:04:14,959
we're going to create a self.init_ui,

88

00:04:14,959  -->  00:04:20,030
and then we're going to create that

89

00:04:20,030  -->  00:04:23,840
function here. And this init_ui that

90

00:04:23,840  -->  00:04:25,310
we're building here is going to

91

00:04:25,310  -->  00:04:25,940
actually

92

00:04:25,940  -->  00:04:28,580
run all of our code. So, the first thing we

93

00:04:28,580  -->  00:04:30,800
need to do is create our buttons, and so

94

00:04:30,800  -->  00:04:32,930
the way that you create a button is you

95

00:04:32,930  -->  00:04:34,940
create a variable to instantiate the

96

00:04:34,940  -->  00:04:38,240
object that is a qt push-button. So

97

00:04:38,240  -->  00:04:41,630
let's go ahead and name it

98

00:04:41,630  -->  00:04:45,500
okButton, and it's going to be equal to

99

00:04:45,500  -->  00:04:49,430
QPushButton, and noticed the

100

00:04:49,430  -->  00:04:51,890
capitalization within here Q and P.

101

00:04:51,890  -->  00:04:55,160
Basically with the pyqt framework

102

00:04:55,160  -->  00:04:58,130
it's camelcase, so the beginning of each word

103

00:04:58,130  -->  00:05:00,950
in the statement itself is

104

00:05:00,950  -->  00:05:04,130
capitalized. And then we're going to pass

105

00:05:04,130  -->  00:05:06,260
in a variable and this is going to

106

00:05:06,260  -->  00:05:08,750
become the text that is on the button. So

107

00:05:08,750  -->  00:05:10,340
in this case we're just gonna say "OK"

108

00:05:10,340  -->  00:05:15,770
and then cancel button is going to be

109

00:05:15,770  -->  00:05:19,430
the same QPushButton except this one

110

00:05:19,430  -->  00:05:25,520
is going to say "Cancel" Now what we can

111

00:05:25,520  -->  00:05:28,700
do is we can put both of these into an

112

00:05:28,700  -->  00:05:31,400
HBoxLayout, and HBox again is

113

00:05:31,400  -->  00:05:33,530
horizontal so it's going to position

114

00:05:33,530  -->  00:05:36,260
each thing as necessary to have them

115

00:05:36,260  -->  00:05:39,440
horizontally interesting line. So let's

116

00:05:39,440  -->  00:05:42,890
go ahead and make a horizontal variable

117

00:05:42,890  -->  00:05:46,130
and it's going to be equal to QHBoxLayout,

118

00:05:46,130  -->  00:05:52,070
and this does not take in any

119

00:05:52,070  -->  00:05:53,480
arguments or anything so we don't need

120

00:05:53,480  -->  00:05:55,310
past anything in there, and we're going

121

00:05:55,310  -->  00:05:57,230
to make it stretch so it's going to be

122

00:05:57,230  -->  00:05:59,060
dynamic in the way that it looks. So

123

00:05:59,060  -->  00:06:04,130
we're going to say horizontal.addStretch,

124

00:06:04,130  -->  00:06:09,380
and then we're going to start adding our

125

00:06:09,380  -->  00:06:12,620
previously created widgets, which

126

00:06:12,620  -->  00:06:14,270
QPushButton is here, we're going to start

127

00:06:14,270  -->  00:06:17,480
adding those into the HBoxLayout. So,

128

00:06:17,480  -->  00:06:19,640
what we need to do is type horizontal.

129

00:06:19,640  -->  00:06:24,020
addWidget and when you call add widget

130

00:06:24,020  -->  00:06:26,180
on the layout it's going to allow you to

131

00:06:26,180  -->  00:06:28,610
add a widget. So examples of a widget in

132

00:06:28,610  -->  00:06:33,950
qt are a label, a push button, a notebook

133

00:06:33,950  -->  00:06:37,380
or tabbed interface that's a widget as well,

134

00:06:37,380  -->  00:06:39,720
and so you can basically use this add

135

00:06:39,720  -->  00:06:43,560
widget method of a horizontal box layout,

136

00:06:43,560  -->  00:06:46,110
or vertical box layout, or a grid layout,

137

00:06:46,110  -->  00:06:48,810
and you can use this method to actually

138

00:06:48,810  -->  00:06:52,440
stuff things into that layout. So we're

139

00:06:52,440  -->  00:06:56,610
going to say okButton, and then

140

00:06:56,610  -->  00:07:08,160
horizontal.addWidget(cancelButton). So, what

141

00:07:08,160  -->  00:07:10,320
we're going to do since this is the qwidget

142

00:07:10,320  -->  00:07:12,180
and this is the main window we can

143

00:07:12,180  -->  00:07:15,030
target it by using self, so this is going to

144

00:07:15,030  -->  00:07:20,040
be equal to mainwindow.setlayout.

145

00:07:20,040  -->  00:07:21,870
So what we're going to do is we just type

146

00:07:21,870  -->  00:07:25,950
self.setLayout and then we tell

147

00:07:25,950  -->  00:07:28,020
it what layout we want to use in case we

148

00:07:28,020  -->  00:07:30,270
create multiple ones. So in this instance

149

00:07:30,270  -->  00:07:32,520
our layout is called horizontal and the

150

00:07:32,520  -->  00:07:34,770
layout is of a horizontal box layout

151

00:07:34,770  -->  00:07:40,050
type. Now once we set the layout we can then

152

00:07:40,050  -->  00:07:41,880
set the window title, and

153

00:07:41,880  -->  00:07:43,350
then we're just going to show its, so

154

00:07:43,350  -->  00:07:49,560
self.setWindowTitle("Horizontal Layout"), and then

155

00:07:49,560  -->  00:07:54,420
self.show. Now this in and of itself

156

00:07:54,420  -->  00:07:55,770
isn't actually going to do anything

157

00:07:55,770  -->  00:07:58,770
because we need to actually run the code

158

00:07:58,770  -->  00:08:02,310
at the bottom of script, so w're going to type if __name__

159

00:08:02,310  -->  00:08:08,190
== '__main__': first we need to instantiate

160

00:08:08,190  -->  00:08:11,460
our app so app = QApplication,

161

00:08:11,460  -->  00:08:15,960
and we're just going to pass in the

162

00:08:15,960  -->  00:08:19,710
system's arguments which there aren't

163

00:08:19,710  -->  00:08:23,310
any. And then we set the

164

00:08:23,310  -->  00:08:29,820
window object to MainWindow, and then we

165

00:08:29,820  -->  00:08:31,260
just tell it to run. So how we're going

166

00:08:31,260  -->  00:08:34,050
to run it is we're going to type

167

00:08:34,050  -->  00:08:36,630
sys.exit, so this means until it exits it's

168

00:08:36,630  -->  00:08:38,340
going to run this code so we are going to

169

00:08:38,340  -->  00:08:45,030
run app.exec_( ).

170

00:08:45,030  -->  00:08:47,460
So we can save this and we can run this

171

00:08:47,460  -->  00:08:48,690
now, and you're going to actually see

172

00:08:48,690  -->  00:08:50,710
what all of our hard work has done.

173

00:08:50,710  -->  00:08:56,230
Ok, I don't know why it showed me that. So as you

174

00:08:56,230  -->  00:08:59,830
can see there is a horizontal layout and

175

00:08:59,830  -->  00:09:03,250
it doesn't stretch, so let's go ahead and

176

00:09:03,250  -->  00:09:13,630
add that one in there, and it still

177

00:09:13,630  -->  00:09:16,540
doesn't stretch. Alright,

178

00:09:16,540  -->  00:09:19,840
oh it's stretching, okay, yeah, because you

179

00:09:19,840  -->  00:09:22,960
can see these are like that the buttons

180

00:09:22,960  -->  00:09:24,970
themselves are not stretching but

181

00:09:24,970  -->  00:09:29,650
the layout is definitely stretching. As

182

00:09:29,650  -->  00:09:34,210
you can see these are moving. So that is

183

00:09:34,210  -->  00:09:36,490
the horizontal box layout. Now what

184

00:09:36,490  -->  00:09:38,530
happens when I just change this one

185

00:09:38,530  -->  00:09:41,440
letter here to V, so now it's a vertical

186

00:09:41,440  -->  00:09:43,540
layout. So if I run it you're going to

187

00:09:43,540  -->  00:09:45,820
see that the buttons are now in a

188

00:09:45,820  -->  00:09:49,960
vertical dimension. So what we're going

189

00:09:49,960  -->  00:09:52,930
to do is we're going to create a vertical

190

00:09:52,930  -->  00:09:55,810
layout, and then put the horizontal

191

00:09:55,810  -->  00:09:57,190
layout within it.

192

00:09:57,190  -->  00:10:01,720
So, let's set this back to a HBoxLayout, and

193

00:10:01,720  -->  00:10:04,480
we're going to create a variable called

194

00:10:04,480  -->  00:10:09,640
vertical which is equal to QVBoxLayout,

195

00:10:09,640  -->  00:10:14,380
and then we're going to say

196

00:10:14,380  -->  00:10:22,150
vertical.addStretch because we want this to

197

00:10:22,150  -->  00:10:25,960
we resize when we actually resize it, and

198

00:10:25,960  -->  00:10:27,880
then we're going to add the horizontal

199

00:10:27,880  -->  00:10:30,250
layout to the vertical layout. So, we're

200

00:10:30,250  -->  00:10:33,880
going to say vertical.setLayout,

201

00:10:33,880  -->  00:10:39,340
actually it's addLayout sorry,

202

00:10:39,340  -->  00:10:43,960
horizontal, and then we're going to set

203

00:10:43,960  -->  00:10:50,530
the main layout to vertical. So I'm going

204

00:10:50,530  -->  00:10:53,440
to save this and run it again, and you're

205

00:10:53,440  -->  00:10:57,610
going to see now that there's different,

206

00:10:57,610  -->  00:10:59,500
I can't really see so what I'm going

207

00:10:59,500  -->  00:11:01,570
to do is I'm going to throw in a label

208

00:11:01,570  -->  00:11:03,990
in there as well. So we will talk about that

209

00:11:03,990  -->  00:11:05,640
as well. So after QPushButton right

210

00:11:05,640  -->  00:11:07,529
here it's within the QT widgets

211

00:11:07,529  -->  00:11:11,010
directories I guess we're going to say

212

00:11:11,010  -->  00:11:15,779
QLabel. And up at the top here we're

213

00:11:15,779  -->  00:11:17,130
just going to create a label called

214

00:11:17,130  -->  00:11:20,279
label, it's going to be equal to QLabel, and

215

00:11:20,279  -->  00:11:24,390
it's going to say "Hi there, I'm a label.

216

00:11:24,390  -->  00:11:27,839
Woot."

217

00:11:27,839  -->  00:11:32,339
Now what we're going to do is we're

218

00:11:32,339  -->  00:11:35,550
going to add to the vertical here, we're

219

00:11:35,550  -->  00:11:39,000
going to add a widget. So vertical.

220

00:11:39,000  -->  00:11:44,459
addWidget, and we're going to add label.

221

00:11:44,459  -->  00:11:46,680
So now when I save I can go ahead and run it you're

222

00:11:46,680  -->  00:11:48,870
going to see that it appears on the top,

223

00:11:48,870  -->  00:11:51,300
so there are different sections here as

224

00:11:51,300  -->  00:11:53,970
you can see. And those are basically what

225

00:11:53,970  -->  00:11:57,870
layouts do. So if again if I add a

226

00:11:57,870  -->  00:12:00,750
vertical layout to a vertical layout and

227

00:12:00,750  -->  00:12:02,339
then use that it's going to show it all

228

00:12:02,339  -->  00:12:04,860
on different lines here, and that's what

229

00:12:04,860  -->  00:12:06,990
you know that's to be expected, I guess,

230

00:12:06,990  -->  00:12:09,839
If you understand vertical and

231

00:12:09,839  -->  00:12:12,750
horizontal or X &amp; Y. So that is basically

232

00:12:12,750  -->  00:12:16,230
the two layout options that you have but

233

00:12:16,230  -->  00:12:18,270
there's also a grid layout, and we're

234

00:12:18,270  -->  00:12:20,310
going to go more into that when we build the

235

00:12:20,310  -->  00:12:21,660
calculator, so we're not really going to

236

00:12:21,660  -->  00:12:24,709
talk about it right now.
