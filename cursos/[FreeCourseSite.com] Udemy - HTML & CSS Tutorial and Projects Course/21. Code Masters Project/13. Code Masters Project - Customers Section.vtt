WEBVTT

00:00.230 --> 00:04.380
And the next section you're going to be building or here is going to be customer section.

00:04.380 --> 00:04.970
Right.

00:04.980 --> 00:10.410
And again like I said we're going to be using the second now or here only will have a background image

00:10.950 --> 00:17.270
then or here we're going to have three cards right here and we're going to have only three items right.

00:17.380 --> 00:20.520
And we're going to place this image or here in the bottom.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.850
So we were going to do more here.

00:21.870 --> 00:22.820
We're going to go back.

00:22.830 --> 00:23.550
All right.

00:23.550 --> 00:25.660
And for now we're going to leave the script.

00:25.890 --> 00:28.010
I'm going to go back to you next to him now.

00:28.170 --> 00:32.220
We're going to go all the way to the end of the theme and we're going to say we're here and this is

00:32.220 --> 00:38.730
going to be customers this is going to be the Mersch and select the line copy and paste the line went

00:38.960 --> 00:41.540
to City on and off customers.

00:41.640 --> 00:46.760
Then once we have the customers ready now I'm going to say a section here.

00:46.860 --> 00:49.750
Glass customers are here.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.340
All right press tab.

00:51.540 --> 00:56.460
And then over here we're going to say a deal of it with customers.

00:57.210 --> 01:04.380
And we're going to say Center on this then we should be adding all whole and all theme.

01:04.380 --> 01:10.910
We're not going to do it for now and at once we're going to set up a whole hour javascript right then

01:10.900 --> 01:12.400
we're going to actually add them right.

01:12.420 --> 01:15.050
Because this is going to be pretty much basically the same way.

01:15.420 --> 01:17.370
And over here we're going to have a first one.

01:17.370 --> 01:19.210
This is going to be customer.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.140
Right so we're going to say we're here.

01:21.270 --> 01:30.240
This is going to be a article with a class of customer article customer press time.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.580
Once we have the article then we'll press first.

01:32.670 --> 01:34.730
We're going to have a link.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.920
So we're going to say we're here to link.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.200
Then within the link We're going to have a hash tag going here.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.280
And I have I have a ass.

01:43.560 --> 01:52.200
And this is going to be quote right so that he quote here and we're going to say right here like this.

01:52.200 --> 01:52.780
All right.

01:52.820 --> 01:53.810
All right.

01:53.870 --> 01:55.400
Me press over here.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.240
Now I can see that something didn't go through right.

01:58.280 --> 02:02.850
And now we need to check whether my spelling is correct and obviously it's not.

02:03.070 --> 02:08.820
All right so now we have a quote Right now we would want a paragraph still right.

02:08.970 --> 02:11.090
With a link just on its own.

02:11.340 --> 02:14.620
So here we're going to say I would say 10.

02:14.900 --> 02:25.410
Lauren room and that's what's too much so let's read Lorem 10 press time and one more time.

02:25.570 --> 02:27.630
Now we have our text.

02:27.710 --> 02:36.440
We're going to have a heading three or here and we're here going to say customer name here and then

02:36.440 --> 02:38.020
over here we're going to have here.

02:38.050 --> 02:38.620
Right.

02:38.830 --> 02:41.410
So we have at right.

02:41.410 --> 02:44.300
Customer Name No we're here at the customer.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.000
So we will do that.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.910
We're going to have a heading 6 or here we're going to have eight percent.

02:51.040 --> 02:51.430
Right.

02:51.460 --> 02:59.610
And then over here we're going to say this is going to be a hash tag 64 or here like this right here.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.240
I'm going to say customer or here like this.

03:02.560 --> 03:08.950
And once we have this now we'd want Image and no one here was going to say image press or here's horse

03:09.310 --> 03:15.700
image and all use the team images right now I've got to download separately a customer image however

03:15.700 --> 03:20.950
right away what we would want is ultimately we're going to say customer or he'll going to say with.

03:21.070 --> 03:24.880
And this is going to be a hundred and fifty or pixels.

03:25.090 --> 03:32.070
So once we have it again we can do this and see says I'm just doing it so we can see better as we're

03:32.080 --> 03:33.190
working on it right.

03:33.370 --> 03:35.230
So this is going to be on in 50.

03:35.260 --> 03:41.560
Right now we have the article and now we would need to copy and paste this four times.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.210
Right.

03:42.250 --> 03:48.400
So what I'm going to say here I'm going to get the whole article and copy and paste this one to three

03:48.910 --> 03:51.360
right and check it out.

03:51.370 --> 03:54.940
We have for some reason two of them because I messed that up.

03:54.940 --> 03:55.610
All right.

03:55.870 --> 04:00.250
So let's go back over here and I want to.

04:00.270 --> 04:08.520
Right now we should four of them right now let's just change the actual values to Team 2 3 4.

04:08.590 --> 04:12.570
Right so this one it was 1 4.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.720
This is going to be three.

04:14.740 --> 04:16.500
And this is going to be number two.

04:16.690 --> 04:17.340
Right.

04:17.770 --> 04:25.210
So once we have them let's go to the style he assessed and actually Styler.

04:25.450 --> 04:25.920
Right.

04:26.170 --> 04:31.010
And so here we're going to start with actual customers and we would need a background on it.

04:31.110 --> 04:37.750
So we're going to go back over here and we're going to say this is going to be a background right for

04:37.750 --> 04:38.420
the customer.

04:38.430 --> 04:48.820
So these are going to be cash hashtags because the marsh Well here again bunch of hashtags on this and

04:48.820 --> 04:55.780
then we're going to write dot right here customers and then we're going to write and this is going to

04:55.780 --> 04:59.290
be patting hundred pixels than zero.

04:59.460 --> 05:05.940
All right so top bottom here zero to the sides then we'll have a background.

05:06.220 --> 05:13.060
And this is going to be customized background so you are all right and image and customers customers

05:13.060 --> 05:13.890
background.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.120
And again we're going to do the same thing right.

05:16.120 --> 05:21.700
This is going to be center position is going to be center the size is going to be cover.

05:21.820 --> 05:27.900
The attachment is going to be fixed and the repeat is going to be no repeat beat or here.

05:27.900 --> 05:28.200
All right.

05:28.210 --> 05:33.510
So now we have over here this image now let's again do a linear background.

05:33.810 --> 05:40.430
We need a gradient gradient as it were lay our G.P.A. right.

05:40.480 --> 05:45.150
And I'm really going to say this is going to be right away a black one.

05:45.150 --> 05:56.320
All right so here we're going to say 0 0 0 0 0 let's say or here 0.6 let's grab this one copy and paste

05:56.320 --> 06:04.360
this on here and let's place a game right now and see that we have a black background.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.550
Now once we have this let's work with an individual customer.

06:07.870 --> 06:09.850
So here this is going to be customer.

06:10.010 --> 06:10.510
All right.

06:10.510 --> 06:17.570
Each one of them first we're going to say with what say well this is going to be 90 percent 90 percent

06:17.800 --> 06:24.790
here then we're going to have margin and the margin is going to be 70 pixels top bottom and auto is

06:24.790 --> 06:26.770
going to be for the horizontal line.

06:26.950 --> 06:33.520
So we're going to place it in the center then we're going to have the line center then we're going to

06:33.520 --> 06:41.070
have a padding of ten pixels top bottom and 20 pixels here left and right.

06:41.470 --> 06:51.040
Then we're going to have a background here and this is going to be five thirty five and so white Macron

06:51.370 --> 06:58.970
like this and border radius radius is going to be 20 pixels or here like this.

06:59.170 --> 07:04.170
Once we have this here now I would want to work with customer a.

07:04.380 --> 07:10.300
And so we're going to say or here customer where any and all here we're going to say this is going to

07:10.300 --> 07:15.730
be font size 50 pixels here right.

07:15.730 --> 07:18.050
So now we're working with a link or here right.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.950
So this should be 50 pixels.

07:20.200 --> 07:24.780
Then we're going to have a color and the color is going to be hash tag.

07:25.200 --> 07:32.510
And if see then we're going to have a B F D B F D on here like this right.

07:32.590 --> 07:39.050
And you can see that I messed it up again because I didn't place say 8 or right.

07:39.220 --> 07:46.510
So now we have all hands like one like this and then the next one after that is we're going to have

07:46.570 --> 07:48.300
a paragraph right.

07:48.370 --> 07:55.240
So here we're going to say that this is going to be customer paragraph or he'll get to and this is going

07:55.240 --> 08:02.740
to be margin 20 pixels or here and then we're going to have a line height right hand is going to be

08:02.740 --> 08:03.570
2.

08:03.790 --> 08:05.580
Then we're going to have a color.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.600
Color is going to be exactly the same as here.

08:08.770 --> 08:08.980
Right.

08:08.980 --> 08:14.200
So we can just copy and paste this copy and paste this here.

08:14.390 --> 08:14.670
Right.

08:14.670 --> 08:16.840
So this is going to be a color but you know what.

08:16.840 --> 08:19.040
No this is going to be a D.

08:19.090 --> 08:21.190
Now you know what let's do with different color.

08:21.380 --> 08:22.820
It's not going to look very good.

08:22.820 --> 08:30.800
So I'm going to say hey d 8 the A D and so I'm going to we're going to use this gray background.

08:30.910 --> 08:35.250
Now let's deal with customer three adding three.

08:35.320 --> 08:39.880
So customer getting three more here what we would want.

08:39.880 --> 08:40.320
Right.

08:40.510 --> 08:47.240
So first we're going to say text transform we're going to say capitalize Oreo like this.

08:47.280 --> 08:51.140
Then once we have this then we're going to say color hash tag.

08:51.310 --> 08:53.800
And this is going to be this is going to be the blue one.

08:53.840 --> 08:54.090
Right.

08:54.100 --> 08:58.290
So we're going to copy paste this and now this is going to be the blue color.

08:58.510 --> 09:01.260
And then let's work with adding sex.

09:01.260 --> 09:06.350
So customer and having sex here.

09:06.450 --> 09:17.840
And what I would want is text or transform when to say how precarious this margin 10 pixels bottom zero

09:18.200 --> 09:23.520
right 20 bottom left is going to be zero.

09:23.680 --> 09:23.920
All right.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.120
I like this.

09:25.140 --> 09:25.650
Right.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.390
So this is going to be on margin.

09:27.670 --> 09:31.610
And once we have this one on him let's work with an image right.

09:31.660 --> 09:38.310
So we're going to say on here customer customer and image here.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.340
Right.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.360
And then we need to do something interesting right.

09:42.360 --> 09:48.580
So here I'm going to write with and we're going to write 150 pixels here we need to write and this is

09:48.580 --> 09:52.340
going to be important important here right.

09:52.340 --> 09:53.040
That's right.

09:53.230 --> 09:54.610
And why were writing important.

09:54.610 --> 10:00.100
Because once we're going to get the car rolling right this size is actually going to change.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.210
I want to show you what I mean by this right.

10:02.230 --> 10:04.200
So what are we going to say we're here.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.750
Remember we would need to target.

10:07.030 --> 10:07.630
Right.

10:07.660 --> 10:09.810
So here we have customers Center.

10:09.830 --> 10:10.270
All right.

10:10.420 --> 10:12.130
So let's ride here.

10:12.390 --> 10:15.220
All curso right.

10:15.310 --> 10:18.410
One class and here all three.

10:18.690 --> 10:21.730
All right let's just check whether that's correct.

10:22.140 --> 10:22.470
All right.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.290
So we're going to go back over here at the op.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.370
All right.

10:26.530 --> 10:28.720
Our curso unhealthy.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.380
All right so this is correct.

10:30.490 --> 10:33.550
However you can see that the carousel starts running.

10:33.580 --> 10:35.650
I haven't set it up right.

10:35.690 --> 10:37.990
So you can see that it actually disappears.

10:38.250 --> 10:38.760
Right.

10:38.810 --> 10:47.480
So what we would need to do right now is actually go to a javascript run and actually set up the customer

10:47.480 --> 10:48.530
center.

10:48.530 --> 10:50.970
So what I'm going to do here is very simple.

10:51.200 --> 10:56.540
We're going to have a theme and I'm just going to copy and paste this one more time.

10:56.540 --> 10:56.900
All right.

10:56.960 --> 11:03.340
And over here I'm going to say oh this is going to be customers right or here I'm going to say not the

11:03.360 --> 11:07.680
center but this is going to be customers center right.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.740
You say this fresh.

11:09.990 --> 11:13.940
And I can see that I have my whole curso working right now.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.660
The difference is going to be let's say we're going to say this and let's go to the Codemasters That's

11:19.670 --> 11:21.740
the father working on right now.

11:21.800 --> 11:22.170
Right.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.230
And let's see or hear right.

11:24.410 --> 11:26.050
So this is what we have right.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.670
So we have right away five of them.

11:28.670 --> 11:35.990
Now if I'm going to go back over here and first of all let's get rid of this important area like this.

11:35.990 --> 11:36.580
Right.

11:36.950 --> 11:40.080
So it's say this let's see how this one is going to look like.

11:41.620 --> 11:44.170
And you can see that there was no change.

11:44.200 --> 11:50.020
Everything was fine but that's because we're here in the script.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.610
We have 1 3 5.

11:51.820 --> 11:55.530
However if I would change it over here to 1 1 1.

11:55.780 --> 11:59.140
So let's say I would want only one of them or here like this.

11:59.150 --> 11:59.450
Right.

11:59.530 --> 12:01.170
So it's a one on one and one.

12:01.440 --> 12:04.320
And if we refresh this is what we're going to have.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.810
And it's definitely not something that you would want to do.

12:06.810 --> 12:07.410
Right.

12:07.440 --> 12:15.580
So here that's why in the main see it says right here important here and now I can see that it's over

12:15.580 --> 12:16.010
here right.

12:16.010 --> 12:21.020
And if we say this if we're fresh even if it's one or here element right.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.830
You can see that image is not going to be distracted or here like this right now.

12:24.830 --> 12:28.970
In our case what we're going to do is we'll going to have one one three.

12:28.970 --> 12:33.590
All right so it's not going to be as drastic here but still we're going to keep this important door

12:33.590 --> 12:33.770
here.

12:33.770 --> 12:40.430
Right now I just want to do a few things we're going to say on margin zero and we're going to say no

12:40.790 --> 12:48.040
more here like this then we're going to have a wider radius more radius.

12:48.220 --> 12:48.540
Right.

12:48.590 --> 12:56.990
And we're going to save 50 percent on this and we're going to see margin bottom was negative 60 pixels

12:57.080 --> 12:57.890
or here right.

12:57.940 --> 12:58.450
Right.

12:58.480 --> 13:02.530
So now we're going to place them basically in the center or here for refresh.

13:02.570 --> 13:05.330
Now I have three of them and you can see how that will work.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.000
Right.

13:06.020 --> 13:11.620
And obviously the size over here was controlled like this.

13:11.630 --> 13:12.240
Right.

13:12.330 --> 13:15.020
With items 1 1 3 or here.

13:15.020 --> 13:15.650
Right.

13:15.650 --> 13:21.770
And again remember to select unique one here because if you're going to two of them with an hour carousel

13:21.770 --> 13:24.560
that's not going to make sense here like this.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.920
Now consider this much speed has been copied.

13:27.140 --> 13:27.630
Right.

13:27.650 --> 13:34.110
And make sure that you always always have the owl curso and all theme.

13:34.110 --> 13:41.150
I mean especially if you want or hear Delk whole theme for our carso for sure our theme if you want

13:41.150 --> 13:42.420
or hear these icons.

13:42.430 --> 13:45.880
All right and now we can move on to a next section.
