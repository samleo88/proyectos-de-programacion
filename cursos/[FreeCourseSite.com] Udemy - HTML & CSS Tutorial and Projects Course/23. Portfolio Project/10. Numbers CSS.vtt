WEBVTT

00:00.560 --> 00:05.290
Once we have added our NHT And now let's go ahead and let's actually apply this.

00:05.320 --> 00:11.840
SS So do the same thing with go to the main C Ss are going to go all the way from the bottom.

00:11.840 --> 00:15.800
We're going to see that we have the end of services section on here.

00:15.920 --> 00:20.150
So we're going to create is a numbers section over here.

00:20.170 --> 00:21.460
Let's copy and paste this.

00:21.500 --> 00:22.360
And Oreo it's.

00:22.520 --> 00:27.960
And of numbers section or here the first one we're going to have is a background.

00:28.250 --> 00:33.860
So we're going to say we're here and this is going to be a verse section and then we would want maybe

00:33.860 --> 00:35.880
First it was a bad thing.

00:36.120 --> 00:40.620
Three R.E.M. is going to be tomorrow Marham then the zero is going to be left and right.

00:40.810 --> 00:48.000
Then let's do a background here and let's do a background of you know let's say Oh here we would want

00:48.020 --> 00:54.080
again images so we would want to tackle the images and then we're going to have a numbers background

00:54.090 --> 00:57.780
or so let's say here this is going to be our numbers background.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.130
Now what you want again for these numbers.

01:00.290 --> 01:08.860
With one center here they're all going to four forward slash cover and also want a no repeat here.

01:09.080 --> 01:10.610
And let's say fixed.

01:10.630 --> 01:14.260
So pretty much all the same things that we already had before.

01:14.510 --> 01:19.910
So we are here whenever we were dealing with this guy with a manner of basically repeating this one

01:20.010 --> 01:26.240
or I can see that here in this case what I would want is I wouldn't want to make this actually darker

01:26.630 --> 01:28.900
because my text is going to be white.

01:28.910 --> 01:35.330
So what I'm going to say here is again I'm going to go to the actual beginning here and before you or

01:35.330 --> 01:37.020
else I'm going to place a comma.

01:37.030 --> 01:41.350
Now get we're going to write a linear grade and I'm going to we're going to use a black color.

01:41.510 --> 01:47.130
So let's say are here RGV zero zero zero point three.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.160
Are you doing this.

01:48.290 --> 01:51.540
Then I can place a comma on GPA.

01:51.560 --> 01:55.280
Zero zero zero point three.

01:55.600 --> 01:59.310
Let's say red and you can see that it's actually got darker.

01:59.390 --> 02:06.110
Now the last one is going to be the actual color so I'm going to say color and voire because we're using

02:06.200 --> 02:08.780
a very well I'm not going to say here right.

02:08.900 --> 02:12.780
So now the actual color right away turn right now.

02:12.830 --> 02:15.690
The next one is going to be numbers center.

02:15.710 --> 02:22.710
So this is going to be again for a centering for number central going to say again Max with more here

02:23.090 --> 02:26.780
Max width and this because we're going to do Ninety five percent.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.070
So this should never be bigger than 94 percent.

02:30.230 --> 02:32.200
And you know what not actually present.

02:32.230 --> 02:38.270
This was actually view with here view with and then we're going to say that this is going to be margin

02:38.630 --> 02:41.720
two RPMs and so on.

02:41.760 --> 02:45.480
So then basically we're placing it in the center.

02:45.590 --> 02:48.380
And now let's start working with a single number.

02:48.470 --> 02:53.060
So numbers here we're going to have a single number.

02:53.070 --> 02:53.640
All right.

02:53.660 --> 02:55.990
So what do you want for the single number.

02:56.010 --> 03:03.030
So basically for the article that contains all the I can call here number and text what we would want

03:03.040 --> 03:03.560
door.

03:03.790 --> 03:06.480
Well first of all want text align center.

03:06.650 --> 03:12.150
So this is going to be the first one and then we're going to do margin two RPMs and zero here.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.490
So top and bottom.

03:13.610 --> 03:18.160
This is actually going to be a margin to our arms.

03:18.250 --> 03:20.040
Know this is going to be easier.

03:20.090 --> 03:22.420
Now you can see that something is not working.

03:22.580 --> 03:26.250
So it may actually go ahead and check and they say him now.

03:26.390 --> 03:28.580
Well they're actually spelled it correctly.

03:28.780 --> 03:35.250
So here you can see this is numbers and instead of numbers I actually wrote a match.

03:35.480 --> 03:41.260
So in this case what I would want is actually select this article and change the software.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.240
So that's right.

03:42.270 --> 03:45.350
And this is going to be the call correct one numbers.

03:45.630 --> 03:47.870
And also we would want to do it over here.

03:48.050 --> 03:53.500
So this is going to be Mersch and this is also going to be the numbers here.

03:53.570 --> 03:58.820
And let me check whether I have it down below also or this was actually the first.

03:59.120 --> 04:03.170
So again you see or hear we're going to write numbers instead.

04:03.290 --> 04:07.020
And once we say it you can see that everything is working correctly.

04:07.040 --> 04:12.480
So once we have fixed my mistake let's go ahead and let's actually continue.

04:12.670 --> 04:18.980
So we're here again what we have is numbers and we have a single number and we have a single number

04:19.070 --> 04:19.750
icon.

04:19.920 --> 04:20.270
All right.

04:20.350 --> 04:28.100
So this was the class that we had before and where we were going to say font size 3 RPMs like this.

04:28.220 --> 04:31.500
And then you have a single number text.

04:31.580 --> 04:37.820
So here we're going to say numbers again single number and instead of I can just write on here this

04:37.820 --> 04:39.250
is going to be next.

04:39.260 --> 04:41.840
Now here we're going to say font size.

04:41.900 --> 04:44.300
This is going to be two rpms.

04:44.500 --> 04:53.570
Then we're going to have a letter spacing of 0.5 RPMs and then we're going to have a margin of 0.5.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.510
Top bottom or E-M and left and right.

04:56.510 --> 04:57.700
This is going to be easier.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.260
So this is what we're doing with a number.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.240
No I have the numbers.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.620
Then we have a title here.

05:04.840 --> 05:06.600
So what would we want for the title.

05:06.610 --> 05:11.140
So we're going to we're going to have numbers to single number instead of text right.

05:11.140 --> 05:11.640
Right.

05:11.650 --> 05:21.940
And this is going to be title title or title we will just one text transform uppercase and this and

05:21.940 --> 05:28.090
then letter spacing let's do 0.5 two or three times on here like this.

05:28.090 --> 05:31.000
So this is going to be our transformation.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.820
And then after that as always what we would want is working with the media because right now there are

05:36.820 --> 05:38.340
going to be displayed like this.

05:38.380 --> 05:45.960
So obviously one them side by side and depending on the actual screen size we also want to count differently.

05:45.970 --> 05:54.760
So let's do a media screen and or here we're going to say I mean with this.

05:54.910 --> 05:58.220
And for the men with we're going to say 576.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.240
So this is going to be for the smaller screen.

06:00.310 --> 06:05.550
So what we would want is we would want numbers here and then we're going to say Center.

06:05.710 --> 06:10.810
So this is going to be the parent container or here we're going to save this play next.

06:10.810 --> 06:16.730
So first we would want this container you see or hear the one that contains all the numbers.

06:16.770 --> 06:23.660
Or you can see that it is called up and I actually need a verse to see or hear this live.

06:23.860 --> 06:26.460
Now we're working with this parent thing.

06:26.680 --> 06:33.100
So first we're going to say this flex and we're going to say flex wrap and the wrap is going to be wrapping.

06:33.280 --> 06:38.250
So each time it gets too big for an actual screen this is actually going to be wrapping.

06:38.440 --> 06:43.240
And then also going to have just different content spacing between again and we're doing this because

06:43.240 --> 06:46.980
we're all going to be adding our own margins in between.

06:47.260 --> 06:52.470
So once we have worked with the numbers center then what's worked with a single number.

06:52.540 --> 06:56.350
So here we're going to find a single number and what we would want that.

06:56.830 --> 07:06.490
Well here we're going to say flex 0 0 so don't grow don't shrink or here we're going to calc 50 percent

07:06.490 --> 07:08.000
like we did before.

07:08.020 --> 07:15.600
So basically half the screen on the smallest screen size is five point rpms or anhydrous.

07:15.630 --> 07:17.880
So this is going to be 576.

07:17.890 --> 07:23.950
So if you are going to go back to my recording and if I'm going to refresh it I mean my numbers as you

07:23.950 --> 07:28.770
can see as the screen size goes bigger these days to call them side by side.

07:28.780 --> 07:35.430
Now I also want to do the same thing as the screen gets to the nine hundred ninety two pixels.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.800
I want to actually all four of them for you.

07:38.040 --> 07:46.540
So what I can say here is I can just select this whole screen or like this selected copy and paste it

07:46.630 --> 07:48.500
and just change the values around.

07:48.790 --> 07:55.180
So first of all it's just change just 1 2 9 9 2 0 here then we're going to get rid of this number and

07:55.330 --> 08:00.370
because we don't need to repeat it because this is all going to stay the same because it's starting

08:00.550 --> 08:03.370
already from 5 76.

08:03.370 --> 08:08.680
Now also here you can see that we have a single number and only thing we need to do here is change the

08:08.680 --> 08:09.220
value.

08:09.460 --> 08:15.530
So instead of 50 percent we're going to do 25 percent or so now there's going to be four columns or

08:15.840 --> 08:22.390
so once we say this here I'm going to go back off here a fresh one so we're going to have a nine hundred

08:22.390 --> 08:24.700
ninety two pixel screen.

08:24.910 --> 08:25.390
Check it out.

08:25.380 --> 08:29.100
What we are now we have actually four numbers side by side.

08:29.380 --> 08:32.770
And this is how we can work with a numbers section.
