00:00.450 --> 00:06.280
In order to write our styles we're going to have to head over to styles seahorses.

00:06.330 --> 00:07.950
Same old deal.

00:07.980 --> 00:09.450
We do need to comment.

00:09.530 --> 00:14.970
And of course if you're sick reading these comments cause you don't have to do it but I always find

00:14.970 --> 00:19.050
it more useful especially if I have to share my code.

00:19.140 --> 00:20.260
Now are you for sure.

00:20.430 --> 00:25.460
Which section is ending where and when the other one starts.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.790
So let's write deals.

00:28.020 --> 00:30.410
Let's change this one to deals now.

00:30.600 --> 00:34.850
First things first I would like to work with input group.

00:34.890 --> 00:36.600
Now where is the input group.

00:37.050 --> 00:40.650
Well that is going to be my one element.

00:40.740 --> 00:46.210
So I have my input group and then within the input group I have two things input as well as the button.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.410
So first of all let's target input group.

00:49.590 --> 00:57.330
Let's say that input group is going to have a width of 80 percent of the screen size width that's the

00:57.330 --> 01:01.010
reason why we're using view with values.

01:01.060 --> 01:02.660
That's step number one.

01:02.760 --> 01:09.120
And then why don't we also write a way set up the max width and for the max with I'm going to use 600

01:09.510 --> 01:10.010
pixels.

01:10.280 --> 01:10.900
Okay.

01:11.220 --> 01:14.240
Then why don't we also add maybe a margin.

01:14.310 --> 01:20.220
Now I would like to place it in the center so I'm gonna say margin tab bottom zero and left and right

01:20.260 --> 01:20.840
order.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.280
Now my input in fact is sitting in the center right now.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.900
That's step number one.

01:26.910 --> 01:33.570
Now I also can use flex marks because this particular input group is in fact a parent container right

01:33.570 --> 01:36.780
now because it has two children items.

01:36.780 --> 01:39.350
So we can do something like this.

01:39.510 --> 01:41.310
This play of flex.

01:41.470 --> 01:41.940
OK.

01:41.940 --> 01:43.710
That's awesome start.

01:43.830 --> 01:47.330
And then why don't we target different control.

01:47.400 --> 01:54.930
Remember that was the class for our input and what I would like to do is set up that the form control

01:54.990 --> 02:02.670
or my input is taking all the space and all the necessary space and then submit button while it just

02:02.670 --> 02:06.300
takes as much space as it needs or its content.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.980
Now how we were able to do that.

02:09.180 --> 02:11.340
Let's head over back and let's think about it.

02:11.370 --> 02:14.270
So we have form control so first of all we'd like to target.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.780
We already have the parent container correct.

02:17.820 --> 02:22.040
So we had our input group and now I can use a flex property.

02:22.050 --> 02:28.520
And in this case I'm going to say like this I mean I say you know what input you can grow as much as

02:28.520 --> 02:29.140
you need to.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.690
So that's the reason why we're using one right now.

02:31.700 --> 02:34.210
Now you can also shrink if you need to.

02:34.250 --> 02:37.430
That's the reason why we also set up one here for the shrinking.

02:37.490 --> 02:41.510
And lastly I'm just going to say you're not your base value is just going to be an arrow and that's

02:41.510 --> 02:41.870
it.

02:41.870 --> 02:42.400
There you go.

02:42.400 --> 02:46.630
We right away our input that is stretching all across.

02:47.450 --> 02:48.180
Awesome.

02:48.530 --> 02:48.980
Now.

02:49.100 --> 02:54.640
Well let's target both of them form control as well as our buttons segment.

02:54.770 --> 02:59.830
So let's add a comma dot n sub met.

02:59.890 --> 03:00.550
Okay.

03:00.590 --> 03:08.300
That was our button and first of all why don't we add a little bit of padding so zero point 3 7 5 0

03:08.320 --> 03:13.290
3 M's and zero point seven five our aims left and right.

03:13.740 --> 03:15.050
Okay.

03:15.620 --> 03:25.630
Then why don't we change the font size font size is going to be one hour Iams or both of them then line

03:25.630 --> 03:26.550
height.

03:26.620 --> 03:30.960
I don't know we can do one point five one point five a line height.

03:31.150 --> 03:40.720
Then also why don't we change the font weight font weight is going to be 300 then we also have a letter

03:40.720 --> 03:41.490
spacing.

03:42.190 --> 03:48.850
So let's use letter spacing and for my value I'm gonna use the variable that we already initially created.

03:49.090 --> 03:51.840
So let's override main spacing.

03:51.850 --> 03:54.670
I believe that was the name memorable.

03:54.670 --> 03:55.270
There you go.

03:55.270 --> 04:02.720
That is my main spacing and maybe let's write a background of transparent so both of them are going

04:02.720 --> 04:10.450
to have the transparent background and text could be uppercase so text transform on the case.

04:10.450 --> 04:13.890
And lastly the outline is going to be none.

04:13.930 --> 04:21.930
So as we're going to focus over our elements well we're not going to have this outline.

04:22.420 --> 04:24.530
That as our initial setup.

04:24.550 --> 04:29.800
Now first of all out right away like to point out something that even though for the button notice the

04:29.800 --> 04:32.410
color is in fact black.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.300
Correct.

04:33.410 --> 04:36.610
Or here we have a different some kind of grayish color.

04:36.610 --> 04:41.560
And the reason for that is because as you can see we can start typing and everything works really well.

04:41.680 --> 04:48.820
But for the place holder Well it is not inheriting the color that we set up for the whole body remember

04:49.300 --> 04:50.950
all the way on the top.

04:50.950 --> 04:56.830
What we did we had for the body we had in fact the color as well as the font family.

04:56.830 --> 05:04.250
Now in my case I think that my fam font family is correct but I can see clearly that my color is not.

05:04.270 --> 05:11.190
However if let's say you can clearly also see that your font family is in fact different.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.740
And in this case it's kind of hard to tell.

05:13.810 --> 05:18.400
Usually if you have like let's say something that is really slanted that is very easy.

05:18.400 --> 05:24.460
But in this case I mean it's kind of hard to tell and I'm just I don't want to bother with Google Developer

05:24.460 --> 05:29.410
tools but in general when I opened some properties are not going to be inherited which in my case I

05:29.410 --> 05:31.710
can clearly see that the color is the issue.

05:31.780 --> 05:38.200
Now if you also have let's say different properties which one example could be the font family then

05:38.530 --> 05:44.580
just head over back grab whatever properties you would like and just add it in place order in the moment

05:44.590 --> 05:45.280
you're going to do that.

05:45.280 --> 05:51.430
Notice right away you're going gonna have this color as well as some other things change there as well

05:51.700 --> 05:53.110
meaning different family.

05:53.110 --> 05:53.930
All right.

05:54.130 --> 05:56.450
Now that is done.

05:56.450 --> 05:56.780
OK.

05:56.830 --> 05:58.610
So we have this particular setup.

05:59.110 --> 06:08.200
And lastly I would like to just work with buttons submit OK let's grab the class Beaty and met and we're

06:08.200 --> 06:10.830
going to have a first of all border.

06:10.900 --> 06:16.180
Now what I would like to do is just have one border because currently what happens is I do have this

06:16.180 --> 06:22.150
border here for my input as well as I have for the submit.

06:22.330 --> 06:26.940
And you know what I say that I have the border but in fact that's something that is missing.

06:26.980 --> 06:33.100
So let's have a border and I'm going to go with two pixels solid.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.850
And again we're going to use the primary color.

06:36.850 --> 06:38.170
So let's set this up.

06:38.170 --> 06:43.840
Now we have our primary color and this is what I'm talking about where I have two borders.

06:43.960 --> 06:47.200
I have one for the input as well as one for the button.

06:47.200 --> 06:52.010
And what I would like to do right now is in fact for the button you know what I'm just gonna say more

06:52.030 --> 06:52.690
left none.

06:53.110 --> 06:57.030
So border left and we're going to set this up as none.

06:57.190 --> 07:03.460
So that's where it looks a little bit more presentable kept than cursor is going to be pointer as we're

07:03.460 --> 07:05.020
hovering.

07:05.080 --> 07:05.950
What else what else.

07:05.950 --> 07:11.890
Transition well as we're going to transition over this button as we're going to hover over this button

07:12.270 --> 07:15.370
I would like to change the background to a primary color.

07:15.370 --> 07:18.430
So again we're going to use our main transition.

07:18.430 --> 07:22.040
So that change is happening over time.

07:22.390 --> 07:27.710
So last but not least we have our N submit our surmised.

07:27.720 --> 07:29.200
We're hovering.

07:29.470 --> 07:38.400
We're gonna change the color to a main white main white and background to her primary color.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.260
Var primary color.

07:41.570 --> 07:43.240
And there you go.

07:43.240 --> 07:45.550
As we're hovering we're gonna have this effect.

07:45.700 --> 07:49.810
So there's two things that I would like you'd take away from this video.

07:49.810 --> 07:55.870
So first of all if you'd like to have your input as well as the button Well you're gonna have to have

07:55.870 --> 08:01.210
some kind of parent container which in this case is just one with some kind of div with a class of input

08:01.210 --> 08:09.220
group and then we use the Flex properties where if I set the parent for a display flex I can just clone

08:09.250 --> 08:10.480
troll my input.

08:10.820 --> 08:11.110
All right.

08:11.530 --> 08:14.670
And then whatever styles we're going to apply for both of them.

08:14.770 --> 08:19.420
Now I'm not going to be ex play displayed exactly the same.

08:19.430 --> 08:19.990
All right.

08:20.110 --> 08:26.890
Now lastly for the place holder if you have any issues getting in fact the properties with the values

08:26.890 --> 08:33.100
that you already previously set up make sure that you target the place holder by having colon colon

08:33.340 --> 08:38.170
and then a place holder and then of course you're just setting up whatever values you would like.

08:38.170 --> 08:41.490
All right so that should do it for the hard DLC assess.

08:41.530 --> 08:49.030
So now we have our form our nice looking forum where the input and the submit button in fact are one

08:49.120 --> 08:49.630
element.
