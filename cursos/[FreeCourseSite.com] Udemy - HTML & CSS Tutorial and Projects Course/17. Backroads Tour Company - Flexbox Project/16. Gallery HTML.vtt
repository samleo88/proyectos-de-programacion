00:00.330 --> 00:08.220
And next up we have our gallery section where we're going to display images from our tours as well as

00:08.220 --> 00:10.750
we're going to place it in the center.

00:10.830 --> 00:13.810
The little Phantasm icon the search icon.

00:13.950 --> 00:16.010
But of course you can see that again.

00:16.020 --> 00:19.570
We're going to use a flex box or a car on layout.

00:19.920 --> 00:23.050
So we're gonna start with a one column layout.

00:23.400 --> 00:29.190
Then once we get to the bigger screen size we are going to have a two column layout and then of course

00:29.250 --> 00:30.890
a three column layout.

00:30.900 --> 00:38.700
Now I did add here the section as a background as well as the title but technically you could just skip

00:38.790 --> 00:41.580
altogether and just place images.

00:41.790 --> 00:43.520
Again it's really up to you.

00:43.830 --> 00:49.410
I'm just kind of went with the same layout like we had previously but technically since we are only

00:49.410 --> 00:57.310
displaying images we could just omit all that and then just have some kind of section with just images.

00:57.340 --> 00:58.090
All right.

00:58.180 --> 01:04.770
Now as always our journey is going to start in the age the email we have and the featured.

01:04.770 --> 01:11.260
So let's copy and paste that then let's write different values of course.

01:11.340 --> 01:18.750
So the comment is going to be gallery so in this case I'm gonna have to cursors I'm going to delete

01:18.780 --> 01:26.910
this and let's just write gallery once we have this particular setup then there's going to be a section

01:27.300 --> 01:28.770
with few classes.

01:28.770 --> 01:35.910
So let's start with the class of section that is of course our generic section class.

01:36.030 --> 01:40.800
Then let's also add a gallery that is going to be used for the background.

01:40.980 --> 01:48.090
And I'm also gonna have the 80s just so we can click on the link and we can navigate to that particular

01:48.090 --> 01:48.770
section.

01:49.360 --> 01:54.210
Once we have all that this is something that is going to look like.

01:54.330 --> 02:02.580
So there's going to be some kind of generic gallery section and then again let's look for our title.

02:02.700 --> 02:05.730
So title let's look where is it.

02:05.940 --> 02:08.180
Yep that's what I would want.

02:08.340 --> 02:15.750
So let's copy and paste that and let's look for our gallery section now within the gallery section.

02:15.890 --> 02:20.160
I said Let's copy and paste our title and let's write gallery as always.

02:20.160 --> 02:24.090
If you are using a different layout would just images.

02:24.090 --> 02:25.100
Of course you don't need.

02:25.110 --> 02:29.610
In fact this title lets say that we do have our gallery.

02:29.620 --> 02:31.410
That's number one.

02:31.410 --> 02:38.740
And then right after the title there's going to be a gallery center center here.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.540
It is going to be a div gallery center and then within this day.

02:43.560 --> 02:48.510
Why don't we have a single item or send or photo.

02:48.510 --> 02:49.730
Doesn't really matter.

02:50.790 --> 02:59.740
And off single item and then we're gonna set it up as a container because I do want my little icon here.

02:59.760 --> 03:06.100
So again we're going to use the container so we can place this icon relative to a container.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.930
Then let's do it.

03:08.970 --> 03:18.010
If we as a class of gallery I am je container and then within this container first of all let's place

03:18.100 --> 03:23.210
a image and the image is going to be from the images folder.

03:23.440 --> 03:26.920
And I'm just going to set this up as two or one.

03:26.940 --> 03:34.880
Then let's also add a class of gallery I am G for styling and as far as alternative.

03:35.090 --> 03:39.180
We're gonna say again awesome or something like that.

03:39.280 --> 03:47.020
Now I can get rid of this attribute I don't need it and then I would want to place my icon as well so

03:47.020 --> 03:56.100
span element with the class of gallery icon and then let's have our font awesome.

03:56.260 --> 04:00.810
So our face if a search curve.

04:01.480 --> 04:02.980
And there you go.

04:02.980 --> 04:07.830
We do have our image as well as our little font awesome icon.

04:07.870 --> 04:12.890
Now what I would like to do right now is in fact copy and paste it five times.

04:12.940 --> 04:17.890
And the only thing we're going to change is in fact the value for our image.

04:17.890 --> 04:27.890
So one two three four five and let's start with two or number six then two or number five four and you

04:27.890 --> 04:30.860
get to just three.

04:31.120 --> 04:39.640
And last but not least because we have two or number two let's save it and we have our six images for

04:39.640 --> 04:42.490
the tours as well as our Phantasm icons.

04:42.550 --> 04:48.400
Once we're done with our animal then we're going to head over to the CFS and start styling.
