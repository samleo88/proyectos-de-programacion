1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,620
So, the first thing that we need to do to
get into programming in Python is

2

00:00:04,620  -->  00:00:06,210
installing it.

3

00:00:06,210  -->  00:00:09,840
So, let's go ahead and discuss about the
three different ways that you're going

4

00:00:09,840  -->  00:00:11,070
to be installing it.

5

00:00:11,070  -->  00:00:15,809
First, we're going to cover Mac because
that's what i'm using and so it's

6

00:00:15,809  -->  00:00:19,710
easiest to show you how to do it. So, what
you're going to do is open up terminal

7

00:00:19,710  -->  00:00:28,080
which I've moved into that folder and put
right here. Now, if you haven't installed

8

00:00:28,080  -->  00:00:34,530
Homebrew, what you're going to do is run
a Ruby command that's going to download

9

00:00:34,530  -->  00:00:42,420
and set it up. So, basically what Homebrew is, is a package manager that you

10

00:00:42,420  -->  00:00:48,270
can use to install a lot of packages. So,
if you're used to Linux basically on

11

00:00:48,270  -->  00:00:52,020
Linux if you want to install a package
you don't need to go all around the

12

00:00:52,020  -->  00:00:55,920
internet and search for packages on
websites and then download from shady sources

13

00:00:55,920  -->  00:01:02,219
and get viruses, that's just a bad
construct of computer operating systems,

14

00:01:02,219  -->  00:01:05,610
but unfortunately that's how Windows
works and so i'm going to show you guys

15

00:01:05,610  -->  00:01:10,530
the right way to install in Windows as
well. Using Linux or OS 10 you're going to

16

00:01:10,530  -->  00:01:15,420
be installing through terminal. So, first
setup Homebrew, this is how you do it,

17

00:01:15,420  -->  00:01:22,170
come to brew.sh and it's going to
give you this line of code here. You just

18

00:01:22,170  -->  00:01:26,520
paste this in terminal, run it, it's going to
install brew. Once you've got brew

19

00:01:26,520  -->  00:01:34,350
installed what you're going to do is run
"brew install python" Now that's how easy

20

00:01:34,350  -->  00:01:35,040
it is.

21

00:01:35,040  -->  00:01:42,390
OS 10 does ship with a version of Python
but the the version included

22

00:01:42,390  -->  00:01:46,710
in OS 10 is 2.7 series and I think
it's actually an old really something

23

00:01:46,710  -->  00:01:50,610
that's like to 2.7.5 or something like
that so it's pretty old.

24

00:01:51,600  -->  00:02:00,960
At least I think it was that. We can
actually run "--python version" here, so okay

25

00:02:00,960  -->  00:02:08,160
so the version that OS 10 El CapitÃ¡n
ships with is 2.7.10. When you run brew

26

00:02:08,160  -->  00:02:12,980
install Python it's going to install
python 3,

27

00:02:12,980  -->  00:02:16,550
that's the command that we're going to
have to be using because there's already

28

00:02:16,550  -->  00:02:21,500
a Python version installed, so we're
going to be using Python 3 and you can

29

00:02:21,500  -->  00:02:25,069
check the version we've got 3.5.1 that's the version that

30

00:02:25,069  -->  00:02:30,680
homebrew is going to install for you. Now
similarly if you're on Linux what you

31

00:02:30,680  -->  00:02:31,610
would do

32

00:02:31,610  -->  00:02:35,030
there's a few different ways because
there's a few different package managers.

33

00:02:35,030  -->  00:02:39,410
So if you're on Arch Linux I don't think
you're gonna need help setting it up, and

34

00:02:39,410  -->  00:02:45,290
actually a lot of Linux distributions
have Python/Python 3 pre-installed, so

35

00:02:45,290  -->  00:02:50,690
you can just run "python --version" and "python3 --version"

36

00:02:50,690  -->  00:02:56,060
and see what version you have installed,
you might need to upgrade, it it might be

37

00:02:56,060  -->  00:03:01,010
fine. If you have 3.4 you can follow
along with this course I don't think

38

00:03:01,010  -->  00:03:05,060
there's that many differences between
the two versions and there's definitely

39

00:03:05,060  -->  00:03:08,510
not code-breaking differences, so that
shouldn't be a problem.

40

00:03:08,510  -->  00:03:12,140
However, if you do notice that you're
having a problem you could upgrade

41

00:03:12,140  -->  00:03:17,660
the version of Python either through the repository or otherwise. If you're on Ubuntu you're

42

00:03:17,660  -->  00:03:21,919
gonna be using the apt-get command, so
you'd run "sudo apt-get install

43

00:03:21,919  -->  00:03:29,630
python3" That's going to install
Python 3 for you. If you're on Fedora I

44

00:03:29,630  -->  00:03:37,220
believe it used to be yum, I think it's dnf
now.

45

00:03:37,220  -->  00:03:47,389
Yeah, so let's just review exactly what
commands you're going to be using, I

46

00:03:47,389  -->  00:03:50,389
think it's like dnf install.

47

00:03:58,100  -->  00:04:04,700
So, you can still use yum I guess, ok so you can use yum to install. So, what

48

00:04:04,700  -->  00:04:13,700
you're gonna do is we're gonna run "sudo
yum install" and then I believe the

49

00:04:13,700  -->  00:04:18,530
package is just called python3, Python 4 is going to be pretty amazing but

50

00:04:18,530  -->  00:04:27,710
right now we're using Python 3. So,
there we go. Now if you're on Arch

51

00:04:27,710  -->  00:04:32,270
and I said I don't think you need any
help getting it setup but just for you

52

00:04:32,270  -->  00:04:41,540
know if you are new to Arch you'd run
"sudo pacman -S python3" but

53

00:04:41,540  -->  00:04:42,140
again

54

00:04:42,140  -->  00:04:47,000
python3 should be pre-installed, so you
shouldn't even need to do any of this

55

00:04:47,000  -->  00:04:51,380
but if you do that's gonna do it. Now on
Windows you do need to go download a

56

00:04:51,380  -->  00:04:55,010
file from the internet and run it, the
the difference between what I said

57

00:04:55,010  -->  00:04:58,280
before what I'm saying now is this is
not a shady location. So, what you're

58

00:04:58,280  -->  00:05:03,170
going to do is go to python.org, go to
the download sections, and if you just

59

00:05:03,170  -->  00:05:06,080
hover over this it's actually going to
show you a drop-down and you can choose

60

00:05:06,080  -->  00:05:12,560
what platform you're on. So you would
choose windows and they actually have a

61

00:05:12,560  -->  00:05:18,380
3.6 which we're not going to we're not
going to be using because this is in

62

00:05:18,380  -->  00:05:20,930
alpha. So,

63

00:05:20,930  -->  00:05:26,240
click latest python3 release python 3.5.1, it's going to take you to this page

64

00:05:26,240  -->  00:05:30,140
and basically give you a changelog and
whatnot.

65

00:05:30,140  -->  00:05:33,650
If you go down here make sure you get
the version that's compatible with your

66

00:05:33,650  -->  00:05:38,570
system. If you have a computer that is
not obsolete it should be running a 64-bit

67

00:05:38,570  -->  00:05:43,280
operating system which means it has a
64-bit processor. S,o you would download

68

00:05:43,280  -->  00:05:46,100
this one right here,

69

00:05:46,100  -->  00:05:51,860
Windows x86 64 executable and what
that's going to download is an .exe file

70

00:05:51,860  -->  00:05:56,660
which you can use to install the
program. If you're running a 32-bit

71

00:05:56,660  -->  00:06:04,820
system you're going to download this one
just the x86, and yeah just install it.

72

00:06:04,820  -->  00:06:08,780
Now, there is one note on the
installation, when you run the

73

00:06:08,780  -->  00:06:10,620
installation there's going to be a

74

00:06:10,620  -->  00:06:13,860
certain step where you have some
checkboxes and one of them is going to

75

00:06:13,860  -->  00:06:20,070
say add python to the path variable, make
sure that's checked because if it's not

76

00:06:20,070  -->  00:06:25,110
checked if you try to run Python in the
command line you won't be able to

77

00:06:25,110  -->  00:06:31,560
because it won't know where to find this
mysterious Python command. So, by

78

00:06:31,560  -->  00:06:36,630
checking that box basically it tells
windows where the Python binary file is

79

00:06:36,630  -->  00:06:37,590
located,

80

00:06:37,590  -->  00:06:43,229
so you want to make sure Windows is
aware of where that file is. And that's

81

00:06:43,229  -->  00:06:47,310
all there is to installing it. To confirm
that you've got it installed open up a

82

00:06:47,310  -->  00:06:53,520
command prompt to terminal and just type Python3 and it should drop you down into

83

00:06:53,520  -->  00:06:57,330
the interpreter, which we're going to be
discussing in the next video.
