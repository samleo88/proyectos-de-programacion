WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:01.240
As always.

00:01.260 --> 00:04.130
First let's check out it looks like right now.

00:04.240 --> 00:10.490
And so we can see over here that we have the master image that is stretched stretched out on here in

00:10.500 --> 00:11.350
this rain.

00:11.520 --> 00:16.620
And as we hover over here right and it's actually appearing and reappearing again.

00:16.690 --> 00:24.030
So maybe over here let's actually refresh right now what we would need to do is actually go ahead and

00:24.150 --> 00:26.200
add equerries.

00:26.220 --> 00:27.960
So what I'm going to do here.

00:28.200 --> 00:34.110
We're going to go back over here and what we're going to say is that once actually there's a meteor

00:34.350 --> 00:40.590
screenwriter we're going to see media screen here and I'm going to say and I'm not going to we're going

00:40.590 --> 00:44.460
to start with men with here.

00:44.560 --> 00:47.740
We're going to say five seventy six.

00:47.780 --> 00:49.460
You're doing this right.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.800
And they're all going to have a team center.

00:52.230 --> 01:01.590
So I'm going to say here that we would want a hash tag team Center team and they're all here or here

01:01.590 --> 01:09.220
would we would want is actually we would want a man with or minimum or maximum with lights or can say

01:09.770 --> 01:10.870
minimax right.

01:10.910 --> 01:17.570
So let's go with men men with here and don't going to say this is going to be 90.

01:17.610 --> 01:21.340
Were you with or here than the margin.

01:21.390 --> 01:23.490
We're here we're going to leave it the way it is.

01:23.490 --> 01:28.900
Right so 0 1 0 0 0 on here knowing this I'm going to place it in the center.

01:29.020 --> 01:33.990
Then after that we would want to display and display flex here.

01:34.020 --> 01:38.210
Right now we can say this and let's actually see what we got.

01:38.260 --> 01:40.230
All right so now we have how many.

01:40.230 --> 01:40.930
Right.

01:41.010 --> 01:45.420
So we have a team here and we have four of them all in one line.

01:45.870 --> 01:53.150
So here we're going to do is we're going to say first justify Canton's space between justify current

01:53.160 --> 01:54.980
and space between.

01:55.170 --> 01:57.380
And then we're going to have a flex.

01:57.510 --> 01:58.090
All right.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.630
And we can just go and check it out.

01:59.660 --> 02:00.990
It looks like right now.

02:01.080 --> 02:06.160
So I would say this refresh rate and nothing has changed.

02:06.180 --> 02:10.360
So what we would want is we would want to actually have a flex wrap.

02:10.580 --> 02:18.960
So here we're going to say is we want to flex wrap or here we're going to say wrap or healing this right

02:19.070 --> 02:20.330
now is going to be wrapping.

02:20.610 --> 02:28.170
And then let's talk to the actual single item I'm going to say team member here and here we're going

02:28.170 --> 02:36.970
to write flex and again 0 0 for flaggers grow and flex drink Coke here calculating.

02:37.030 --> 02:44.150
And this is going to be 50 percent minus 10 pixels or here like this.

02:44.150 --> 02:44.880
All right.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.890
So then we can save this.

02:47.010 --> 02:52.090
This is going to be for the small screen now so we really know how to do it to make it right.

02:52.110 --> 02:57.570
So what we're going to do is was going to copy and paste this or here and we can grab this guy over

02:57.570 --> 03:04.090
here to 776 get rid of all this here.

03:04.110 --> 03:06.040
It's not necessary.

03:06.250 --> 03:09.840
Change this one to 25 here.

03:10.110 --> 03:15.350
We're going to save this on here and let's just take it on what we have when we refresh.

03:15.350 --> 03:16.060
Right.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.030
You can see these are going to be 10 pixels.

03:18.030 --> 03:20.380
Now it's going to be four of them on here.

03:20.410 --> 03:21.400
This right.

03:21.420 --> 03:25.020
If we got a smaller screen now it's going to be two of them.

03:25.020 --> 03:28.150
If we go to the small screen there's only one of them.

03:28.230 --> 03:33.360
However as I'm hovering You can see that the image is showing here this icon.

03:33.560 --> 03:36.270
And what happens if I want to turn the icon right.

03:36.270 --> 03:40.080
Only thing I need to do is actually hover over the icon.
