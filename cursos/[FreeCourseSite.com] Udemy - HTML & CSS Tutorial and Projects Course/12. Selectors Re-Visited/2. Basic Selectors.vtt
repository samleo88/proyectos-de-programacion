00:00.230 --> 00:00.790
All right.

00:00.810 --> 00:05.580
Why don't we start with the basics that we already have covered all through our discourse.

00:05.880 --> 00:08.400
But it's kind of important starting point.

00:08.400 --> 00:12.980
So let's say within the age the amount we're going to say there's going to be heading and I'm going

00:12.980 --> 00:15.480
to purposely name them exactly the same.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.590
Just so we can kind of see the difference.

00:17.590 --> 00:21.840
So I'm going to say there's going to be heading one with an idea of heading and I'm going to call this

00:21.900 --> 00:30.420
I am I.D. heading so extremely simple and we'll get a copy and paste this line and we're going to write

00:30.420 --> 00:33.410
that not there's going to be heading with an I.D..

00:33.740 --> 00:40.270
There is going to be instead of glass and here we can just write a last hearing again just so we can

00:40.270 --> 00:43.060
see that there's obviously going to be a difference with selections.

00:43.270 --> 00:50.520
And you know what last but not least let's add a little tiny paragraph with a hello world in it.

00:50.740 --> 00:52.050
So far so good.

00:52.060 --> 00:56.820
Now what's happening in the CSI as we already know what basic selectors we can use.

00:56.890 --> 01:02.080
So let's say if want to select them all I can just say selection of all and we're going to be looking

01:02.080 --> 01:06.170
for the color red now all of them are going to be with a color red.

01:06.220 --> 01:11.220
We can also select the 80 and I can say for the I.D. I would want one.

01:11.220 --> 01:15.940
Well first of all I would need to have the hash tag then I would need the name of the I.D. and then

01:15.940 --> 01:20.400
let's add maybe different font size 40 pixels is gonna be good enough.

01:20.530 --> 01:22.860
Then we have text transform property also.

01:22.990 --> 01:26.580
So let's transform it to uppercase.

01:26.710 --> 01:28.950
So this is gonna be my upper case dude.

01:29.060 --> 01:29.890
And you know what.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.130
Let's change the color.

01:31.150 --> 01:32.760
So here we would like to change the color.

01:33.100 --> 01:35.990
And we already know that there is gonna be specificity.

01:36.010 --> 01:44.470
So even though we selected all the elements and added color red since this is more specific we are overriding

01:44.680 --> 01:49.480
the property value that we had with a less specific selector.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.940
Now we can also use the class.

01:50.950 --> 01:56.890
And again this would be the difference that if with an idea we had a hashtag with class we always need

01:56.890 --> 01:57.900
to use the dot.

01:57.940 --> 02:03.240
And even though they're named the same they're going gonna perform the completely opposite because we're

02:03.250 --> 02:04.780
gonna be adding different styles here.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.950
So let's say font size is gonna be instead 20 pixels.

02:09.010 --> 02:10.640
So this is going to be simple.

02:10.840 --> 02:17.740
Then text transform going to be looking for the capitalization as well as let's add the color green.

02:17.740 --> 02:19.660
And again more specific.

02:19.780 --> 02:25.340
So we will gonna be up overwriting this whatever value we had with universal selective.

02:25.390 --> 02:32.500
Now last but not least we had the element selector where we can just write a letter spacing it is gonna

02:32.500 --> 02:34.050
be I don't know 20 pixels.

02:34.300 --> 02:39.310
Again basics that we have covered but it's important to keep them in mind.

02:39.310 --> 02:41.290
So just in case we wouldn't forget them.
