00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,230
Hey guys, i'm just going to run the
previous command here. In this video

2

00:00:04,230  -->  00:00:08,970
we're going to just talk about how to
use multiple different field and values

3

00:00:08,970  -->  00:00:15,240
to grab objects. So, in this example I'm
looking for any document that has a

4

00:00:15,240  -->  00:00:19,949
favorite number of 445 and it returned
four documents.

5

00:00:19,949  -->  00:00:25,170
Let's say I want to find every document
that has the favorite number and the

6

00:00:25,170  -->  00:00:29,970
username equal to, yetanother. So what I'm going to do as you guys can guess it's

7

00:00:29,970  -->  00:00:33,329
just a regular dictionary object that
we're passing in here, so you're just

8

00:00:33,329  -->  00:00:37,110
gonna type "username": and then the value you're looking for which is "yet another"

9

00:00:37,110  -->  00:00:41,399
and you'll see that now I only have two
documents.
