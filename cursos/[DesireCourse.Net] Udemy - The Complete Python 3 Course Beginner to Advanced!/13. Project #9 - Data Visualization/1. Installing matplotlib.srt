00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,460
Hey guys, let's jump into data

2

00:00:02,460  -->  00:00:05,879
visualization. So what we're going to be

3

00:00:05,879  -->  00:00:09,210
using for this is a library for

4

00:00:09,210  -->  00:00:13,290
Python called matplotlib, and it allows

5

00:00:13,290  -->  00:00:15,540
you to create visualizations of data

6

00:00:15,540  -->  00:00:18,570
like line charts, bar charts, etc. And so

7

00:00:18,570  -->  00:00:22,980
let's go ahead and install it. I am going

8

00:00:22,980  -->  00:00:25,470
to bring up terminal here, you do the

9

00:00:25,470  -->  00:00:28,140
same. If you're on Windows you will need

10

00:00:28,140  -->  00:00:32,610
to run pip3, and I hope it's in your

11

00:00:32,610  -->  00:00:38,190
path. A little note on Python and Windows

12

00:00:38,190  -->  00:00:40,500
is when you install it using the

13

00:00:40,500  -->  00:00:42,210
installer there's an option that you

14

00:00:42,210  -->  00:00:43,980
need to make sure it's checked

15

00:00:43,980  -->  00:00:49,469
that says add to path. And then once you

16

00:00:49,469  -->  00:00:51,360
do that and install it, if you open up a

17

00:00:51,360  -->  00:00:55,530
command prompt and the Python command

18

00:00:55,530  -->  00:00:58,440
isn't found, then just try restarting. You

19

00:00:58,440  -->  00:00:59,969
can also check your path and stuff like

20

00:00:59,969  -->  00:01:01,350
that. If you guys need more help

21

00:01:01,350  -->  00:01:04,229
definitely just let me know, but if you

22

00:01:04,229  -->  00:01:06,659
got to this point then I think you're

23

00:01:06,659  -->  00:01:12,960
fine. So, Linux and Mac OS run terminal, on

24

00:01:12,960  -->  00:01:14,760
Windows open up command prompt, and

25

00:01:14,760  -->  00:01:18,780
you're going to type pip3 install

26

00:01:18,780  -->  00:01:22,710
matplotlib. And it's going to pull in I

27

00:01:22,710  -->  00:01:26,220
think numpy and scipy as well.

28

00:01:26,220  -->  00:01:30,119
Yeah, there's numpy,

29

00:01:30,119  -->  00:01:32,310
it's going to bring in a bunch of

30

00:01:32,310  -->  00:01:37,350
dependencies here. So, there we've

31

00:01:37,350  -->  00:01:39,270
installed it, and it also tells me that

32

00:01:39,270  -->  00:01:42,570
pip has a new version. So let's go ahead

33

00:01:42,570  -->  00:01:45,920
and update pip here.

34

00:01:50,140  -->  00:01:55,780
There we go, and this should update it. No,

35

00:01:55,780  -->  00:02:03,250
I ran pip instead of pip3, right. So

36

00:02:03,250  -->  00:02:07,060
it's trying to update Python 2's

37

00:02:07,060  -->  00:02:14,410
pip. There we go. No? Not pip3 either.

38

00:02:14,410  -->  00:02:21,520
i will have to check out what's going on

39

00:02:21,520  -->  00:02:28,120
with that. It's a permission denied problem...

40

00:02:28,120  -->  00:02:34,630
sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip. If you guys ever

41

00:02:34,630  -->  00:02:37,090
get a permission denied error with

42

00:02:37,090  -->  00:02:41,080
Python, chances are you just need to run

43

00:02:41,080  -->  00:02:44,230
it as sudo, but if you don't want to run

44

00:02:44,230  -->  00:02:47,500
sudo commands just anywhere you know you

45

00:02:47,500  -->  00:02:51,670
should, you might want to dig into

46

00:02:51,670  -->  00:02:54,850
further why the permission was denied. But

47

00:02:54,850  -->  00:02:57,940
for this instance root has access to

48

00:02:57,940  -->  00:03:01,959
this file. So, I'm going to close this, and

49

00:03:01,959  -->  00:03:04,299
we've just installed matplotlib. Now in

50

00:03:04,299  -->  00:03:05,860
the next video we're going to get to

51

00:03:05,860  -->  00:03:09,070
some basic usage, and we're going to ramp

52

00:03:09,070  -->  00:03:12,730
up our usage of matplotlib to what I

53

00:03:12,730  -->  00:03:16,019
hope will be intense levels.
