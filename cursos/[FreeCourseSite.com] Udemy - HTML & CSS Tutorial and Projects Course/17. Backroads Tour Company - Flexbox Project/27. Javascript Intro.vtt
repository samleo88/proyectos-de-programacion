Awesome guys we're done with our project.

00:03.060 --> 00:10.950
As far as HD the CSX is concerned and the only thing left is adding some functionality using JavaScript

00:11.850 --> 00:17.560
before we proceed though I would like to mention a few things as far as javascript is concerned.

00:17.670 --> 00:24.720
First adding javascript is optional and the main purpose of this project was to showcase the use of

00:24.870 --> 00:26.540
C as plex blocks.

00:26.580 --> 00:33.360
Second since it's not a job script I'm not going to spend tons of time covering the javascript code

00:33.360 --> 00:38.220
that we're gonna write so I'm not going to cover JavaScript in great detail.

00:38.220 --> 00:44.760
As a side note if you are interested in learning javascript I do have an awesome project based javascript

00:44.760 --> 00:48.220
course on your DME so be sure to check it out.

00:48.230 --> 00:55.530
And third if you get stuck or you just don't want to bother typing javascript but still would like to

00:55.530 --> 00:57.490
add functionality to your project.

00:57.630 --> 01:05.730
Just head over to a set of files and look for complete AB J.S. file on that file and copy and paste

01:05.760 --> 01:13.260
the contents of that file in the app just file that we're going to work on in the following videos.

01:13.290 --> 01:20.610
Remember the app Jazz that we created all the way in the set of video and you're gonna have to have

01:20.610 --> 01:21.900
some tweaks though.

01:21.900 --> 01:27.560
Meaning keep in mind that even though you're going to have all the javascript there's still some HD

01:27.570 --> 01:31.860
the amount and CSF tweaks that you're going to have to do.

01:31.860 --> 01:34.500
All right in order to afford javascript to work.

01:34.950 --> 01:41.040
So I would still suggest watching the following videos where in the beginning of the video I'm going

01:41.040 --> 01:46.320
to set up the HDMI or see Asus and then later we're going to write JavaScript.

01:46.320 --> 01:52.560
Now if you don't want to write JavaScript just copy and paste whatever content we have in the complete

01:52.620 --> 01:53.840
app J.S. file.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.480
So let's head over to the set of files and then within the setup files you're going to notice the file

02:00.480 --> 02:02.340
by the name of complete.

02:02.340 --> 02:10.050
Have J.S. and what you can do is just open up this file in your text that are like I said You can either

02:10.050 --> 02:16.060
grab everything just select everything and copy and paste it in the app Jess again.

02:16.080 --> 02:22.680
Please keep in mind you're going to have to do some tweaks in the HCM now or spaces in order for this

02:22.680 --> 02:24.870
to work so you can do it this way.

02:24.930 --> 02:31.410
If you don't like to actually write just or you can do video by video more let's say we're gonna start

02:31.410 --> 02:32.790
by setting up the date.

02:32.790 --> 02:39.800
So just grab whatever we have as far as data is concerned and then copy in the app Jesus just so you

02:39.800 --> 02:41.350
can see that everything's working.

02:41.760 --> 02:49.620
Now I would like to also mention that again your I.D. and classes need to match whatever I have in my

02:49.620 --> 02:56.100
project because the javascript that is sitting within the complete app and the same javascript we're

02:56.100 --> 03:01.870
gonna write depends on the classes and ideas that you have in your HDMI out.

03:02.130 --> 03:07.210
All right now first of all let me delete everything that I had here in the app Jess.

03:07.350 --> 03:13.200
And starting from next video we're gonna work on the functionality for our project.
