Awesome we know how we can add image to our ratio our document.

00:04.850 --> 00:11.350
How or where we can get nice images and more importantly copyright free images.

00:11.360 --> 00:18.450
First of all let's get rid of this external one because it's going to annoy us really fast though all

00:18.450 --> 00:22.140
these lines of code let me just delete this guy.

00:22.300 --> 00:28.570
And sure enough right now I'm just gonna have the Udemy logo and while getting your images simply from

00:28.570 --> 00:35.980
Google is fine or whatever small projects we're doing for round use whenever you're going to be doing

00:35.980 --> 00:42.040
something commercial you're going to get it in a lot of trouble if you're just gonna say let's say some

00:42.040 --> 00:45.970
kind of images and you'll gonna be using them for your commercial purposes.

00:47.030 --> 00:55.190
So what we need to do is get images that have no copyright issues that are copyright free and obviously

00:55.220 --> 00:57.160
there's many sites that you can use.

00:57.410 --> 00:59.800
But I usually prefer using three of them.

00:59.870 --> 01:04.580
So one of them would be pics eBay then I really like pixels.

01:04.580 --> 01:11.060
Mostly I'm getting everything from the pixels and by the way pixels also has the video ones as well

01:11.060 --> 01:14.660
as you have gratis graffiti and with the greatest graphic.

01:14.660 --> 01:18.860
It's more like funny pictures you see is like with bunch of people.

01:18.860 --> 01:21.650
And again it would work exactly the same way.

01:21.800 --> 01:27.020
So if you're going to go to the site and if you're going to find wherever you're looking for and let's

01:27.020 --> 01:32.200
say in pixels we would like to have technology something like this.

01:32.240 --> 01:38.120
Then I wish they were getting very high quality and copyright free images.

01:38.120 --> 01:43.960
So in this case let's get this laptop and again to work the same way save images.

01:43.970 --> 01:45.780
Again we would say it here.

01:45.950 --> 01:53.930
Let's say a laptop that's going gonna be the name and was gonna get whatever extension it provides us

01:53.930 --> 01:54.640
anyway.

01:54.920 --> 02:00.350
So I'm gonna head over again and we're gonna test it out one more time where we're all gonna say that

02:00.350 --> 02:07.400
this is not gonna be image of me then me in the right image of pixels.

02:07.460 --> 02:15.680
Laptop lets you write underneath the heading 3 the image tagging on and we know that we have the source

02:15.680 --> 02:19.230
attribute and within the source attribute again we're looking for damage.

02:19.850 --> 02:25.520
Now since I would like to have the laptop almost like an actual laptop and let's say here this would

02:25.520 --> 02:34.030
be the image of laptop so pixels laptop would be my alternative text.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.320
So I'm gonna save this.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.330
And sure enough I'm getting my image.

02:37.600 --> 02:43.340
Now the issue is that image is really big and this is something we're all going to cover next video.

02:43.340 --> 02:47.830
But first of all let me just double check it how this is gonna look in my regular browser.

02:47.830 --> 02:50.160
Meaning not in this small one.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.730
That's right next to me by the actual text editor.

02:53.790 --> 02:55.100
So guys do the same thing.

02:55.120 --> 03:01.570
We're gonna look for 127 port five thousand and sure enough still this image is gonna be much bigger.

03:01.570 --> 03:06.430
So next real gonna talk about it how we can adjust the size of the images.
