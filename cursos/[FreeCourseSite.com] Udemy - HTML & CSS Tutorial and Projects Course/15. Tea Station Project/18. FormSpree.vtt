00:00.300 --> 00:06.220
Normally this is where we would stop so we would set up the HDMI form then style the form.

00:06.390 --> 00:11.820
But there's no way for us to collect the values because we haven't hooked up any BHP or any kind of

00:11.820 --> 00:12.900
back in language.

00:12.900 --> 00:18.910
However thanks to an awesome service called Formspring we can actually fix that.

00:18.930 --> 00:21.390
So how we can do that as always.

00:21.390 --> 00:25.930
Let's head over to our good old friend Google and you're going to write Formspring.

00:26.070 --> 00:30.820
You don't have to sign up for anything you don't have to pay anything you don't have to leave the card.

00:30.830 --> 00:33.720
No you don't need to leave your grandmas name.

00:33.720 --> 00:34.800
You don't need to do anything.

00:35.190 --> 00:41.850
The only thing you need is to get an action attribute with the value of Formspring and then the email

00:41.850 --> 00:42.830
you would like to use.

00:43.080 --> 00:47.310
And also you would need to use the method of post obviously later on.

00:47.310 --> 00:52.970
They have the plans if you like the service and all that but just for testing or just for right or no

00:52.980 --> 00:57.170
small use you can freely use it and nobody is gonna do anything.

00:57.570 --> 01:02.670
So what happens is what I would like to do is just grab this action for you right now as well as the

01:02.670 --> 01:10.110
method with the post and we all gonna head over to our text editor then I'm gonna find within the indexation

01:10.110 --> 01:16.020
email remember we have the form and for now we just have the form group which is used for styling.

01:16.320 --> 01:21.500
Right now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna copy and paste it values as well as I would like to enter the

01:21.500 --> 01:22.290
email.

01:22.380 --> 01:26.140
I'm gonna be entering my email if you want me to get your forms.

01:26.220 --> 01:32.130
I mean you can type my email but in general what you need is to type the email where you would like

01:32.130 --> 01:33.150
to receive those forms.

01:33.900 --> 01:35.740
So for now I created.

01:35.850 --> 01:43.800
Right away the email that I'm gonna be using for this I'm gonna say learn code and let's call this tutorial

01:43.800 --> 01:47.810
that is gonna be my email and this is not gonna be at email not common.

01:47.820 --> 01:52.050
This is gonna be in fact had g mail that come moment we say it.

01:52.260 --> 01:58.920
I'm gonna head over back to our testing site and let's say that there is going to be John Smale.

01:59.250 --> 02:06.970
And then we're going to be looking for e-mail e-mail at e mail dot com.

02:07.500 --> 02:14.260
So some kind of e-mail and the message would be Hey buddy let's just put maybe a few exclamation marks

02:14.650 --> 02:16.660
now the moment we're going to click save.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.120
Notice what's going to happen.

02:18.160 --> 02:21.590
So first of all it says okay your form needs active rotation.

02:21.640 --> 02:27.280
Now I'm going to be looking at my inbox and I can see that I got already the mail from Formspring so

02:27.280 --> 02:30.730
I can just open this up and the way this is going to work.

02:30.850 --> 02:33.100
We need to look for activate the form.

02:33.490 --> 02:36.940
So now we're going to activate the form and now it says awesome.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.640
The form is active so we can head over back to the local host.

02:40.660 --> 02:44.920
And by the way right away tell you now what happens here is that they'll let us know.

02:44.980 --> 02:45.600
OK.

02:45.730 --> 02:49.940
You have the new form submission the name whatever name we put.

02:49.990 --> 02:51.380
Then we had an e-mail.

02:51.430 --> 02:55.920
Actually some e-mail and then we're here having the message of hey buddy.

02:56.320 --> 02:59.010
And the neat thing is that we can use it on both.

02:59.230 --> 03:03.330
We can use it here even on our local environment as well as the moment.

03:03.340 --> 03:06.440
We're going to set it up everything on a notify.

03:06.550 --> 03:08.500
We can still get the forms.

03:08.560 --> 03:14.500
There is also a nice feature on a metal file you can actually do it on the actual notify service but

03:14.500 --> 03:19.280
we're not going to cover this right now we're probably going to look at it at later projects when we're

03:19.300 --> 03:22.720
working with like flex box or grid or something like that.

03:22.720 --> 03:27.520
For now we're just gonna deal with the Formspring and with the fact that we're literally one line of

03:27.520 --> 03:28.150
code.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.970
Now we can get the form.

03:29.970 --> 03:34.500
So again we don't need to do any kind of BHP setup or anything like that.

03:34.630 --> 03:37.630
We just set up this one line and we're gonna be getting our forms.

03:37.630 --> 03:43.470
Well obviously you need to activate it and all that but I mean it kind of is understandable right.

03:43.570 --> 03:44.920
What else what else.

03:45.310 --> 03:49.110
What's gonna happen is the moment we're gonna place it on a little fly.

03:49.510 --> 03:51.040
They're all gonna send another one.

03:51.140 --> 03:57.250
And the first time you're gonna submit the form you're gonna have to do another confirmation because

03:57.250 --> 03:58.540
the basic idea is like this.

03:58.540 --> 04:03.860
So for this site now at the moment this is gonna be connected to the local host.

04:03.880 --> 04:11.260
However the moment we're gonna upload it to notify then we're gonna be able to connect it from Myrtleford.

04:11.560 --> 04:18.140
So that way you can also get the form submissions as the site is gonna be live on and live right.

04:18.400 --> 04:24.970
If you want to discover it a little bit more so let's say first of all they say setup is easy no registration

04:24.970 --> 04:30.940
and all that just an action attribute and all that and this is where I said that the name attribute

04:31.000 --> 04:36.850
is important because that's the whole way how we actually collected the values and by the way this is

04:36.850 --> 04:44.170
how you would do exactly the same with BHP where you would be collecting whatever is in these name attributes.

04:44.230 --> 04:49.390
So for the name attribute with a value of name you're gonna be collecting that value and so on and so

04:49.390 --> 04:50.060
forth.

04:50.080 --> 04:53.770
So let's say what is serving here this form needs active attention.

04:54.350 --> 04:56.950
Yeah we can just do it like this.

04:57.150 --> 04:58.860
You can say I'm not a robot.

04:59.020 --> 05:00.980
That's one thing that they're gonna tell you.

05:01.060 --> 05:03.430
And then we can return to original site.

05:03.790 --> 05:10.320
So now I can do as many form submissions as you like and you're gonna be getting it in e-mail and noticed

05:10.330 --> 05:11.780
right now I'm getting my email.

05:11.950 --> 05:12.800
Awesome.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.180
And just delete it.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.010
What else what else.

05:15.010 --> 05:22.270
Well regarding their documentation if you need more information again you can go to form setup.

05:22.510 --> 05:26.300
You can go to promoting articles at this point in time.

05:26.380 --> 05:31.710
Again I don't see the point of covering this because this is strictly age the amount he assessed course

05:31.730 --> 05:34.560
so this is out of the scope of the course.

05:34.570 --> 05:42.670
However I did want to show you a nice little feature by the name of Formspring which allows you to actually

05:42.670 --> 05:48.160
submit the values the form and more importantly you can collect these values with any kind of hassle

05:48.160 --> 05:50.200
or back and languages like BHP.
