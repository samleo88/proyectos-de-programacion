WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:01.250
So far so good.

00:01.260 --> 00:02.360
So we have our now.

00:02.360 --> 00:02.970
Button.

00:02.970 --> 00:05.040
Well what else are we looking for.

00:05.040 --> 00:07.300
We also would want to Navarre correct.

00:07.560 --> 00:12.590
Because once I click it I'm gonna get my number and then I can navigate to a different page.

00:12.610 --> 00:13.880
This would be the home page.

00:13.990 --> 00:15.770
And also I have the skills.

00:15.810 --> 00:21.770
So this is gonna be my skill section as well as product and about how I'm not going to show you about

00:21.780 --> 00:22.770
you understand the idea.

00:22.800 --> 00:26.730
But we would want to have the Napper now with this number.

00:26.850 --> 00:33.030
There's also gonna be a little bit of different setup because there's gonna be a few things here as

00:33.030 --> 00:38.130
we're opening the now bar and if we're gonna be on a smaller screen or wanted to take it the whole with

00:38.310 --> 00:45.360
the screen or as our screen size gets bigger we're gonna make the NAB bar smaller as well as we're gonna

00:45.360 --> 00:49.510
make it obviously able so we can close it and open up to now.

00:50.130 --> 00:53.720
And in this case this there is gonna be a little bit of more code.

00:53.810 --> 00:55.280
And why don't we start working on it.

00:55.680 --> 01:00.600
Well first all we have to now button and then right after the NAV button we're gonna be looking at our

01:00.600 --> 01:02.900
number within the now bar first.

01:02.910 --> 01:09.140
We're gonna have the NAV element now it's gonna be our name of semantic element with few classes.

01:09.150 --> 01:13.600
We're gonna have the class of Navarre as well as the idea of Navarre.

01:13.650 --> 01:16.110
And again this is just used for JavaScript.

01:16.110 --> 01:20.470
So we'll make sure if you will gonna be using JavaScript then you have these ideas.

01:20.570 --> 01:27.090
However I want you to know that if you don't let's say understand JavaScript or anything like that you

01:27.090 --> 01:32.340
can just copy and paste the code or just use the code from the lecturer resources.

01:32.400 --> 01:37.140
So please don't be worried even if you're going to mess up something here it doesn't matter you can

01:37.140 --> 01:39.540
just get the correct code from the resources.

01:39.750 --> 01:45.600
But if you will gonna mess it up on your own end meaning if you're going to try to code with me within

01:45.600 --> 01:51.990
javascript then most cases that will happen is that people just misspelled their I.D. or something like

01:51.990 --> 01:52.560
that.

01:52.630 --> 01:59.400
And so that way if you are trying to write the javascript code with me then make sure that those ideas

01:59.400 --> 02:01.880
actually match what I'm writing.

02:01.920 --> 02:08.430
Anyway long story short make sure that they had these match within the Navarre let's do maybe header

02:08.850 --> 02:12.810
and within the header we're going to be placing our close button.

02:13.200 --> 02:18.870
So when we say now bar header and here I would like to have this power span is gonna have the class

02:18.870 --> 02:23.900
again and can I use the close as well as the idea of close.

02:23.910 --> 02:25.250
So now close.

02:25.510 --> 02:30.240
And the idea of NAV flows so something like this.

02:30.810 --> 02:34.480
And then within the span again I would want to use the font awesome.

02:34.560 --> 02:39.420
So it's a I that is I have a times.

02:39.420 --> 02:43.660
So we would need to have a times and hopefully this is gonna work.

02:43.740 --> 02:46.220
So we have times and then more and we say.

02:46.650 --> 02:52.530
Yeah we have our header lastly we still have a lot of work to do in the CSM But for now at least we

02:52.530 --> 02:57.870
have the header right after the header not within the header but right after the header we can write

02:57.870 --> 03:06.480
we unordered list and then would know within the UN or list we could maybe go with class of NAV items

03:06.750 --> 03:14.340
and then within the items we could have a list item with no class actually we can leave the last blank

03:14.760 --> 03:18.990
but we're gonna place our links and again for now these links are not going to be working apart from

03:18.990 --> 03:22.970
indexation email but we're gonna set up those different pages later.

03:23.490 --> 03:25.660
So let's say here with a class I would want.

03:25.660 --> 03:29.530
Now link for my links and then just write home.

03:29.670 --> 03:33.670
And now I would like to copy and paste them because I would want four of them.

03:33.670 --> 03:36.190
And in this case we're just gonna have to change the values.

03:36.450 --> 03:43.140
So I'm going to select all these values here just like that and then we're gonna write that the second

03:43.140 --> 03:51.550
page is going to be skills then we have about then we also have the product and you know what we also

03:51.550 --> 03:57.020
need obviously change these pages which don't exist anymore or not anymore not yet.

03:57.150 --> 04:01.600
Interesting mouth skills then we're having about page.

04:01.780 --> 04:08.100
This is gonna match and we do need to ADHD email so make sure you do the image email.

04:08.540 --> 04:12.860
And here we're also gonna have product product and you know what.

04:12.890 --> 04:17.950
Let's add the quotation marks thing that way is just gonna work out a little bit better.

04:17.970 --> 04:20.480
So for now this button obviously is covering it.

04:20.520 --> 04:23.170
But we're going to fix that in a second.

04:23.170 --> 04:24.120
Oh what else we need.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.130
Well we need to house is hers.

04:26.340 --> 04:31.890
Then we're gonna head over whereas the now more and we're gonna start adding our styles first and foremost

04:31.920 --> 04:37.620
let's start working with a number because I do want it position fixed and again depending on the screen

04:37.620 --> 04:40.080
size we are gonna be changing the width.

04:40.170 --> 04:43.050
So first and foremost let's do position.

04:43.380 --> 04:44.950
Position is maybe be fixed.

04:44.970 --> 04:46.940
So so far so good.

04:47.070 --> 04:51.870
And if I would want this position fixed to take up the whole screen I can deal like this.

04:51.870 --> 04:56.360
I can say top is going to be zero left is gonna be zero.

04:56.390 --> 04:56.790
Right.

04:56.790 --> 05:01.170
It's gonna be zero and you guessed it the bottom one is also going to be zero.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.310
So I mean right bottom.

05:03.310 --> 05:05.670
And that should be zero.

05:05.820 --> 05:09.280
The moment we're gonna save it for so we're not gonna be able to see anything.

05:09.390 --> 05:11.550
Now what is again the reason for that.

05:11.580 --> 05:15.840
Well we do need to use this index and in this case I'm not going to use design index of one.

05:16.170 --> 05:22.380
I'm gonna use the z index of two and reason for that is because I would want this nav bar to be covering

05:22.380 --> 05:26.810
whatever I have within it but I also would want to have some kind of background.

05:27.480 --> 05:33.600
So background is gonna be I don't know main grey that I think should work out and yeah there's gonna

05:33.600 --> 05:35.720
be a number so far so good.

05:35.760 --> 05:36.660
What else we would want.

05:36.690 --> 05:44.770
Well let's do pairing top and in this case looking at I don't know putting it up one hour Yeah this

05:44.830 --> 05:52.360
is gonna work out padding left is gonna be what say to our having left to our arms so this is gonna

05:52.380 --> 05:58.790
push it away from the side and then we also see these annoying list items and then we're gonna fix that

05:59.010 --> 06:00.380
literally in a second.

06:00.420 --> 06:09.060
However before we do anything I do want to add a transition because as we're gonna be closing and opening

06:09.060 --> 06:11.420
the number we would want to do it.

06:11.640 --> 06:16.830
So it actually happens fluidly not right away but with our usual transition.

06:16.970 --> 06:18.480
So we already know how to do that.

06:18.480 --> 06:24.810
We're looking for the main transition and now let me add the comment that we're all going to be working

06:24.810 --> 06:26.360
a little bit with transformation.

06:26.770 --> 06:28.610
So let me write transform.

06:28.740 --> 06:30.470
Just in case I forget.

06:30.600 --> 06:34.040
And after that I'm going to be working with nav close.

06:34.080 --> 06:39.100
So right now I've closed so that is gonna be Horrocks here and here for this guy.

06:39.090 --> 06:44.550
We're gonna say font size is gonna be to our AMS So it will gonna be bigger as well as we're gonna have

06:44.550 --> 06:45.610
a cursor point.

06:46.750 --> 06:47.990
Not too much stuff.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.900
I think that's gonna do okay.

06:49.930 --> 06:58.890
Like I said Now I'd like to get her off this list of type of items I believe that was our unknown list.

06:59.230 --> 07:05.650
And here we said that we would want list style type and we'd just set it equal to none.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.710
And hopefully this is going to work out.

07:07.910 --> 07:10.510
And I think it does what else we have.

07:10.550 --> 07:16.030
We have the link remember in the annexation email we added this link with the class of now.

07:16.610 --> 07:22.380
So I don't wish to style it when I was say nav link but for the novel link I would want it to be display

07:22.380 --> 07:28.910
in block not inland log but display block because remember this was in general right away displayed

07:28.910 --> 07:30.260
in line by default.

07:30.740 --> 07:32.740
So I always say display block.

07:32.810 --> 07:35.090
So now our links are going to be spanning all across.

07:35.090 --> 07:40.780
First of all as I'm hovering over anywhere over the link I'm going to be able to click on the link.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.090
So that's first of all.

07:42.390 --> 07:47.690
Now second I would want a bigger some font size so too are you.

07:47.690 --> 07:52.700
I'm just gonna do text transform and go with an upper case.

07:52.910 --> 07:57.440
Color is gonna be primary color primary color.

07:57.590 --> 07:59.280
It's gonna be green.

07:59.280 --> 08:04.890
And then we're gonna add also a transition because as I'm hovering over the links I would want to have

08:04.890 --> 08:06.240
a little bit of an effect.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.610
So let's see here.

08:07.650 --> 08:09.990
I'm gonna have this little padding moving to the left.

08:10.020 --> 08:11.690
So why don't we have that.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.530
Why don't we say again transition.

08:13.650 --> 08:19.140
And since this is not our first rodeo I'm going to be kind of skipping that because we have done quite

08:19.140 --> 08:23.440
a few of them so they should be already feeling very comfortable.

08:23.640 --> 08:27.970
And then we have the main transition as well as we'd like to set up to our effect.

08:28.350 --> 08:32.460
So let's say here and have link and as we're hovering.

08:32.460 --> 08:33.930
Something should happen.

08:33.930 --> 08:39.510
So let's say here like this nav link as we're hovering the NAV link is actually going to have a dark

08:39.510 --> 08:39.990
color.

08:40.560 --> 08:45.960
So going you use the main dark as well as we're gonna add a little bit of padding to the left.

08:45.980 --> 08:53.350
So that's gonna be our effect powering to the left is gonna be let's say zero point five grams.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.510
And now we have successfully almost done.

08:56.540 --> 09:02.330
However I would want to set up the media query like I said that once we get to a bigger screen size

09:02.780 --> 09:06.210
then we're gonna have only this much space with a number.

09:06.230 --> 09:11.390
However if this is going to be smaller then the number is going to be taking the whole page.

09:11.390 --> 09:20.270
And for this we're gonna use the media query some say media screen and let's say like this let's say

09:20.270 --> 09:24.580
and and men with and then basically starting from what kind of screen.

09:24.640 --> 09:30.110
So I'm gonna say man with it is gonna be so and pixels.

09:30.170 --> 09:36.480
So starting from that screen size I do want to work with the number and for my nav bar I'm going to

09:36.480 --> 09:42.940
say that starting from that screen size I'm going to have 30 view widths so 30 percent on the screen.

09:43.080 --> 09:47.440
However I want to make sure that the max with is always gonna be 20.

09:47.610 --> 09:49.620
So it never is gonna get any big.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.960
And yeah this is gonna be the setup.

09:51.960 --> 09:58.130
However there is one thing that I need to obviously mention is that by default I don't want my name

09:58.330 --> 09:59.240
to be show.

09:59.370 --> 10:04.890
So originally I would want my number to be hidden and then we're going to set it up with the javascript.

10:04.890 --> 10:11.220
The moment we click on one button and the second button then we can close it and open up the tab.

10:11.520 --> 10:17.280
So in order to do this I'm gonna head over back to the nav bar and we'll add the transform and what

10:17.280 --> 10:19.160
I'm going to say is gonna be transformed.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.600
And then we have an option of translating.

10:21.630 --> 10:23.540
Now remember we had translate x.

10:23.670 --> 10:25.950
So what if I would move a hundred percent.

10:25.950 --> 10:31.470
What that means is that my Navarre is going to be totally moved out of the site the moment I'm gonna

10:31.500 --> 10:31.950
save it.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.900
There is no no that's it.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.130
We cannot see the net.

10:35.460 --> 10:40.680
What's gonna happen though is later on as we're working obviously with our buttons and everything then

10:40.680 --> 10:43.220
we're gonna be able to see the number we can add.

10:43.230 --> 10:48.540
Hundred percent like this where we can do a hundred negative doesn't really matter what you're doing

10:48.540 --> 10:52.770
is you're just hiding the number either the right hand side on the left hand side.
