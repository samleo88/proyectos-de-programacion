While we're still on the subject of the fireworks I also would like to cover dummy text.

00:05.300 --> 00:09.240
You see there there's gonna be situations where you know that there's gonna be some kind of content

00:09.720 --> 00:12.270
but you don't have the actual content.

00:12.540 --> 00:17.790
And also as you can see in this case it would also serve me really well since that I don't have to type

00:17.790 --> 00:19.150
all this gibberish.

00:19.230 --> 00:22.520
Now how do we can create dummy text in nation email.

00:22.530 --> 00:29.060
The fastest way we've seen name it and let me just delete this first if I'm gonna type Lorem.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.740
You will notice that I'm getting some kind of command.

00:32.310 --> 00:35.400
So if I'm just gonna press it over here notice what's gonna happen.

00:35.410 --> 00:39.940
Basically we're gonna be getting a dummy text Lorem hip some text.

00:40.110 --> 00:44.580
Now we can control how big it is because for now as you can see as I save this.

00:44.580 --> 00:45.210
Check this out.

00:45.420 --> 00:51.870
So this would be my text and there's just specific amount of words or I can also control how many words

00:51.870 --> 00:57.060
I'm getting from this dummy text so I can say Lorem and then I would need to specifically say how many

00:57.060 --> 00:57.350
words.

00:57.900 --> 01:00.070
So if I fired 150 All right.

01:00.690 --> 01:03.720
He fired one 10 but I was there I'd get 10 words.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.210
And again press tab or return.

01:06.630 --> 01:09.410
And sure enough we're gonna be getting this dummy text.

01:09.410 --> 01:16.060
Now if you don't like for some reason using it in your email then you can also search for this law remember

01:16.110 --> 01:22.560
some kind of universal dummy text so you can just say Lorem Epsilon and you're gonna be getting tons

01:22.560 --> 01:26.660
of generators that pretty much give you the dummy text.

01:26.760 --> 01:32.220
Now if you like to be a hipster you can just use Laura maybe some hipster and this is just gonna give

01:32.220 --> 01:36.270
you a dummy text that has basically a bunch of hipster words.

01:36.450 --> 01:40.510
So let's say I could say five paragraphs again we just click on b me.

01:40.680 --> 01:47.520
And as you notice here instead of this Laura maybe some typical dummy text we're getting all kinds of

01:47.520 --> 01:48.440
hipster words.

01:48.510 --> 01:54.600
So if you are a hipster or you would like to be a hipster maybe you would want this dummy text as a

01:54.600 --> 01:55.560
hipster Epsom.
