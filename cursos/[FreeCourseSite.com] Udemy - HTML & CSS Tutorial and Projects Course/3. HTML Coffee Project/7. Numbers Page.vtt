WEBVTT

00:00.460 --> 00:05.490
Before we start working on no page let me just make a quick correction.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.990
We're here at the very top.

00:07.990 --> 00:13.300
Instead of having this heading three years and about I'd still like to leave this as a coffee junkie

00:13.810 --> 00:18.650
because obviously this is gonna be the name of our project or Page or the company.

00:18.790 --> 00:26.230
So I'll just keep this coffee junkie as well as let's write the title with capital E and as we say right

00:26.230 --> 00:27.830
now everything is working fine.

00:28.090 --> 00:31.570
Now let's decide what's happening within the numbers.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.910
Now this is going to be my final project.

00:33.910 --> 00:40.360
I'm going to navigate the numbers and within the numbers again most of the things stay exactly the same.

00:40.360 --> 00:46.630
The difference would be here is our stories we're all going to use our table now in our case.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.260
I think it's going to be faster.

00:48.290 --> 00:54.040
We're is going to copy and paste everything that's in the about email and then then just get rid of

00:54.040 --> 00:54.580
this text.

00:55.870 --> 00:57.380
Again let's create a new file.

00:57.910 --> 01:00.290
Let's call these numbers.

01:00.340 --> 01:01.780
Email again.

01:01.780 --> 01:05.050
Everything was selected in the validation email.

01:05.050 --> 01:09.050
Now I can just copy and paste in the number station e-mail.

01:09.100 --> 01:14.790
Now like I said I would like to delete all this long paragraph because this is not what we're gonna

01:14.800 --> 01:15.930
be doing.

01:15.930 --> 01:16.680
And that's right.

01:16.680 --> 01:21.330
First of all numbers or our numbers or we you like or you know.

01:21.670 --> 01:26.480
Let's call this our stores thing that just gonna make a little bit more sense.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.120
And let me select the whole paragraph.

01:29.300 --> 01:30.090
Delete it.

01:30.850 --> 01:33.630
Let's maybe change the title of the page.

01:33.720 --> 01:34.900
Is that always going to be right.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.190
No numbers.

01:36.190 --> 01:37.370
Let's save this.

01:37.480 --> 01:43.600
And from our about page we can navigate right now to the numbers and sure enough all just gonna have

01:43.600 --> 01:47.110
our heading with our stores title.

01:47.170 --> 01:50.300
Now within the title what we're gonna have now.

01:50.350 --> 01:52.880
Like you said we're gonna be working on our table.

01:53.460 --> 01:59.530
So first we know that we need to have the table element and then within the table element we start working

01:59.530 --> 02:00.680
with rows.

02:00.700 --> 02:04.630
Now maybe let's add a little bit of clarification.

02:04.780 --> 02:07.640
So in our case again we're going to use the comments.

02:07.660 --> 02:10.140
So I'm gonna write and this is gonna be for the city.

02:10.180 --> 02:16.340
So this is gonna be our table roll for the city now for the table roll we need to create a table or

02:16.340 --> 02:24.310
rogue element and then we're looking for either table data elements that would reflect columns or since

02:24.310 --> 02:29.520
we would like to have some kind of headings I'm gonna go with table heading element so here I'm gonna

02:29.530 --> 02:31.400
write that the first one is gonna be city.

02:31.810 --> 02:37.530
So that would be pretty much telling what my columns are gonna be like as well as you know what.

02:37.530 --> 02:40.370
This is gonna be the first one is gonna be Chicago.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.480
And let me copy and paste this.

02:42.550 --> 02:46.630
So while the first one is Chicago we also have an option of New York.

02:47.080 --> 02:50.830
So the stores would be located in Chicago as well as New York.

02:50.980 --> 02:57.630
And we also have an option of Los Angeles let's save this and this would be my city.

02:58.090 --> 03:01.180
And then these would be my cities.

03:01.200 --> 03:01.540
Okay.

03:01.630 --> 03:02.890
So far so good.

03:02.890 --> 03:08.890
Now we also can right away maybe add the comment of and off city so we know that this would be the end

03:08.890 --> 03:14.480
of the roll and maybe let's create another one where we're gonna have some kind of numbers.

03:14.770 --> 03:22.870
So let's say maybe before that and then other comment orders and of orders.

03:22.870 --> 03:29.240
So the beginning of the comment and then the comment made me feel it and also end of orders.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.600
And now let's start creating our roles now within the role.

03:32.880 --> 03:38.580
There's gonna be instead of table heading table data let's write table data and the first one is gonna

03:38.600 --> 03:42.250
be the name of our role which will be numbers or orders.

03:42.250 --> 03:43.500
My apologies.

03:43.580 --> 03:50.200
Let's copy and paste this and let's write that in the first one is gonna be and twenty five.

03:50.320 --> 03:54.040
The second one is gonna be 250.

03:54.040 --> 03:57.530
And last but not least we're gonna be looking for 500.

03:57.540 --> 04:02.140
So this is gonna be our second row again as we copy pasted notice.

04:02.260 --> 04:04.040
These are gonna be our orders.

04:04.040 --> 04:07.750
Now last but not least we're gonna be looking for basically profit.

04:07.750 --> 04:11.950
So whatever profit our city stores will be generating.

04:11.950 --> 04:14.110
So let's rewrite this.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.450
This will be profit profit.

04:17.530 --> 04:22.590
Let's make sure that we write this correctly as well as land of profit.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.130
And let's just add some kind of dollar value.

04:25.660 --> 04:29.150
Now I would also like to change the name of my role.

04:29.230 --> 04:30.800
This would be profit now.

04:31.330 --> 04:36.290
And here we're gonna be looking for dollar sign meaning this would be significant.

04:36.330 --> 04:42.610
That this is a dollars and let's say 10000 10000.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.910
And let's just copy and paste this.

04:44.970 --> 04:48.760
So let's say first one second one.

04:49.810 --> 04:50.650
Third one.

04:50.760 --> 04:55.700
How are we gonna change it to 20000 30000.

04:55.780 --> 04:57.950
And that should be good enough now.

04:57.950 --> 04:58.880
Last but not least.

04:58.880 --> 05:05.210
Again I'm going to implement a little bit of CSX because it bothers me that it looks so bad.

05:05.210 --> 05:08.720
So what we would need to do and again you don't need to worry about the syntax right now.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.140
It's very very easy.

05:11.200 --> 05:16.720
Yes a syntax that we'll get to cover later on but I would like to write again style attribute.

05:16.820 --> 05:24.800
So this is gonna start my inline C assess and then let's just add border and board needs to be two pixels

05:25.610 --> 05:26.760
solid.

05:27.110 --> 05:35.410
Let's say black as was the other property would be border spacing border spacing.

05:35.670 --> 05:39.950
And that's gonna be equal to let's say 25 pixels.

05:40.030 --> 05:47.490
So spacing the call on and let's just write twenty five pixels now on the moment we're gonna save it

05:47.550 --> 05:51.230
as you can see right now the table looks a little bit more presentable.

05:51.330 --> 05:55.710
Now last but not least let's just check it out in the bigger browser window.

05:55.770 --> 06:01.370
Again we would want to navigate away from about we're going to go to numbers and yeah we have our stores

06:01.380 --> 06:05.540
so our number page is finished and now it can work on contact page.
