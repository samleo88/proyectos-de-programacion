1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:05,069
Alright, so what kind of work environment
do we need to be efficient at

2

00:00:05,069  -->  00:00:10,380
programming with Python? The question can be posed for any programming language

3

00:00:10,380  -->  00:00:14,820
really, and so the answer is usually
going to be same.

4

00:00:14,820  -->  00:00:21,480
I mean feel free if you want to, to open
up notepad on Windows or you know some

5

00:00:21,480  -->  00:00:25,380
basic text editor and write a script and
go over to the terminal and command prompt

6

00:00:25,380  -->  00:00:29,490
and run it, however that's not efficient
for a variety of reasons.

7

00:00:30,210  -->  00:00:34,530
So, what we're going to be using is an
IDE, which stands for integrated

8

00:00:34,530  -->  00:00:42,600
development environment, and we're going to be using Jetbrains PyCharm. Now,

9

00:00:42,600  -->  00:00:47,129
PyCharm is free for, I spelled that wrong

10

00:00:47,820  -->  00:00:57,000
just go to Google, search PyCharm, and
click on the link there which is from

11

00:00:57,000  -->  00:01:02,760
jetbrains.com, and you can download it.
Now when you get to the download screen

12

00:01:02,760  -->  00:01:06,990
you're going to get a professional or
community version, choose the community

13

00:01:06,990  -->  00:01:13,350
version that is free, it's completely
fully featured as far as i can tell, and

14

00:01:13,350  -->  00:01:16,860
that's the one that we're going to be
using in this video. Now

15

00:01:17,400  -->  00:01:22,350
alternatively I mean you can go have a
look at other IDEs for Python, but I find

16

00:01:22,350  -->  00:01:27,119
that this one it just works really well,
it's simple, and it does everything that

17

00:01:27,119  -->  00:01:32,490
we need it to do, and it also has some
advanced features which we may look at

18

00:01:32,490  -->  00:01:38,400
some point in the future. So, go ahead
download the installer for your platform,

19

00:01:38,400  -->  00:01:45,720
it does require Java as well, so you can
just open up Google and type download

20

00:01:45,720  -->  00:01:54,119
Java, and it's going to take a java.com/download if you click that link, just

21

00:01:54,119  -->  00:01:59,100
click download the appropriate
version for your system, and once you

22

00:01:59,100  -->  00:02:04,079
have that installed then you can install
PyCharm. So, let's take a walk around

23

00:02:04,079  -->  00:02:07,079
PyCharm right quick.

24

00:02:08,789  -->  00:02:12,840
So, this is going to be the first screen
that you see every time you start up

25

00:02:12,840  -->  00:02:16,530
PyCharm. The first launch screen is a bit
different you can choose a theme and

26

00:02:16,530  -->  00:02:17,579
whatnot,

27

00:02:17,579  -->  00:02:23,459
all that is relevant really. We're going
to create a new project, it's going to be

28

00:02:23,459  -->  00:02:26,430
pure Python, now there's also other
options here if you want to start a

29

00:02:26,430  -->  00:02:32,159
Django project, etc., but we're just going
to start a Python project here and we're

30

00:02:32,159  -->  00:02:40,859
going to choose version 3.5.1
which is also going to tell the IDE

31

00:02:40,859  -->  00:02:48,299
here where to find the binary files to
run Python. Now, we're also going to name

32

00:02:48,299  -->  00:02:58,379
the project here, so first program, and
this is going to be the name of our

33

00:02:58,379  -->  00:03:02,310
project. It's going to create a folder
called first program and this is how

34

00:03:02,310  -->  00:03:13,709
we're going to identify it within here.
So, along the left-hand side here this

35

00:03:13,709  -->  00:03:18,180
is the project view so let's go ahead
and right click and create a new file.

36

00:03:18,180  -->  00:03:19,379
Now,

37

00:03:19,379  -->  00:03:23,639
additionally you can create a new
directory, a Python package, and a bunch of

38

00:03:23,639  -->  00:03:26,669
different file types here. We're just
going to choose a Python file and i'm going to

39

00:03:26,669  -->  00:03:33,930
name it main, which is going to name it
main.py, and here we can start typing

40

00:03:33,930  -->  00:03:45,269
our script. So, again i'm just going to
use the hello world example, and that's

41

00:03:45,269  -->  00:03:50,010
all it's going to be. I'm going to save
it, keyboard shortcuts are going

42

00:03:50,010  -->  00:03:54,810
to take you a long way if you're going
to become a programmer, so I expect you

43

00:03:54,810  -->  00:03:59,879
know some already, if you don't on
Windows Linux control + S saves the file

44

00:03:59,879  -->  00:04:07,259
and on OS 10 its command + S so you don't have to always go through the menus and

45

00:04:07,259  -->  00:04:11,639
stuff, but let's have a look through the
menus. If you want to create a new

46

00:04:11,639  -->  00:04:17,190
project, a new file, or directory you can
open one etcetera, you can actually

47

00:04:17,190  -->  00:04:21,870
access the settings by going to default

48

00:04:22,380  -->  00:04:27,690
settings for this project, and a bunch of
different options down here that we

49

00:04:27,690  -->  00:04:31,800
don't really need. If you go to edit
you're going to see you can undo and

50

00:04:31,800  -->  00:04:35,700
it's also going to show you the
corresponding keyboard shortcuts for

51

00:04:35,700  -->  00:04:39,120
each one of these options, so this is
command + Z and that's going to undo

52

00:04:39,120  -->  00:04:44,580
whatever action I previously did, this is
also going to be useful if you're going

53

00:04:44,580  -->  00:04:52,110
to become a professional programmer. Same is true for copy, paste, find. We're going

54

00:04:52,110  -->  00:04:56,910
to be discussing find at some point, I
mean it's a pretty powerful command you

55

00:04:56,910  -->  00:05:00,990
can find not only in the current file
but your entire project if you want to

56

00:05:00,990  -->  00:05:05,460
look for instances of variable or string
or something you can actually search

57

00:05:05,460  -->  00:05:13,290
through the entire root directory of
this project if you want. If you go to

58

00:05:13,290  -->  00:05:16,290
view and go tool windows here

59

00:05:17,010  -->  00:05:21,690
is what we're looking at here
project if we select that it's going to,

60

00:05:21,690  -->  00:05:30,480
it should hide that, yeah, so it hid the
project sidebar, so we're going to leave

61

00:05:30,480  -->  00:05:36,480
that open. Now, we can also show favorite structure, etcetera. If you have version

62

00:05:36,480  -->  00:05:40,980
control setup this will not be disabled
and you can use that to perform first

63

00:05:40,980  -->  00:05:42,270
control actions.

64

00:05:42,270  -->  00:05:49,770
We're going to open up a Python console
here and here we can actually run Python

65

00:05:49,770  -->  00:05:55,680
code. If we wanted to say 5+5 you know
and it's going to return that so this is

66

00:05:55,680  -->  00:06:01,230
the interpreter itself, however if we
want to actually open terminal we can

67

00:06:01,230  -->  00:06:09,840
open a terminal here and here we can
just type python3 main.py and it's

68

00:06:09,840  -->  00:06:15,480
going to run what we have up in this
file right here. Now additionally we have

69

00:06:15,480  -->  00:06:23,010
a run right here. We can set up run, a run
configuration here, to actually every

70

00:06:23,010  -->  00:06:26,760
time we hit the run it's going to
automatically run our projec,t so let's

71

00:06:26,760  -->  00:06:31,080
go ahead and hit the plus sign, choose
python,

72

00:06:33,310  -->  00:06:42,640
and it's gonna be called a Python run,
script is going to be python3 or the

73

00:06:42,640  -->  00:06:46,360
script is going to be the the actual
python script that we want run so it's

74

00:06:46,360  -->  00:06:51,760
going to be main.py, script parameters
this is if we're passing in any arguments or

75

00:06:51,760  -->  00:06:54,850
anything we're not going to it's already
found the Python interpreter because

76

00:06:54,850  -->  00:07:00,370
when we set up the project we chose the
correct Python version. This is going to

77

00:07:00,370  -->  00:07:05,170
be interpreter options we're not going
to be using any, and that's all that we

78

00:07:05,170  -->  00:07:11,410
need to do. So, let's go ahead and click
apply and then run, and it's going to run

79

00:07:11,410  -->  00:07:15,640
the script, output that, and then it says it
finished with exit code zero which is

80

00:07:15,640  -->  00:07:17,230
completely normal.

81

00:07:17,230  -->  00:07:21,460
So, every time you want to run if you
have this little section opened here

82

00:07:21,460  -->  00:07:25,540
just hit that play button, the Run
button there, it's going to run the code

83

00:07:25,540  -->  00:07:31,270
in real time. So, make changes, hit ctrl + S,
and then run the code right there, this

84

00:07:31,270  -->  00:07:37,480
is the most efficient way to run a
program in an IDE, you know, you don't have

85

00:07:37,480  -->  00:07:41,170
to switch back and forth between windows and stuff. So, this is the primary reason

86

00:07:41,170  -->  00:07:46,000
that we're going to be using this IDE
for the sake of this course.
