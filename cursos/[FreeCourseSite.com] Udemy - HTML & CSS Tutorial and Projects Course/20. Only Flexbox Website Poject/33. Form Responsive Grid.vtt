00:24.930 --> 00:34.950
And then we're going to have a so-and-so in six pixels here and they're going to have a contact center

00:35.320 --> 00:44.780
or here we're going to set this play grade like this and grid template columns we're going to say repeat

00:45.480 --> 00:47.870

00:56.460 --> 01:00.310
