WEBVTT

00:00.520 --> 00:04.820
In order to stay alert we already know that we need to head over to ELC assess.

00:04.870 --> 00:09.160
And here let's say after the body I will gonna create some more comments.

00:09.160 --> 00:14.020
And here I'm going to call this the entity classes or you know what we can do.

00:14.020 --> 00:19.810
Maybe Global's it doesn't really matter but you'll see in a second why we are using these classes and

00:19.810 --> 00:21.280
what is the purpose for them.

00:21.380 --> 00:28.030
So let's call them helper utility classes and hopefully this is spelled correctly.

00:28.060 --> 00:30.640
Classes so that's gonna be one thing.

00:30.640 --> 00:35.590
Then again we're gonna have now bars and everything so religious right here now bar and this is gonna

00:35.590 --> 00:41.110
generally understand that we're going to be dealing with our numbers here and then we have our headers.

00:41.440 --> 00:44.290
So right after that we're gonna have the headers and you know what.

00:44.290 --> 00:47.130
No there's one more thing that's gonna be global.

00:47.150 --> 00:52.800
So there's gonna be a little bit of difference whether we're going to have the global styles and helpers.

00:52.870 --> 00:54.840
You don't have to technically do this.

00:54.910 --> 00:58.990
I'll show you that we can just write everything in once they assess blood.

00:59.320 --> 01:04.090
Structuring your sisters also helps you later on if you're looking for something.

01:04.090 --> 01:06.930
So that's something you should keep an eye on.

01:07.030 --> 01:10.300
Let's say here this is gonna be our header and I'm going to start working on her.

01:10.410 --> 01:14.810
And again I'm gonna do the same thing then there's gonna be header and then there's gonna be end of

01:14.810 --> 01:17.210
her what we want within that.

01:17.350 --> 01:20.500
Well first of all we are also selecting the class.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.570
Then we would like to have the main height.

01:22.670 --> 01:25.050
I'm gonna say menhaden is gonna be 100 right.

01:25.660 --> 01:28.870
What would be the difference between generally mean height and height.

01:29.530 --> 01:31.900
If I set this up with a height of hundred.

01:31.900 --> 01:37.170
So if I'm gonna avoid this mean height what's gonna happen is if this is gonna be bigger if there's

01:37.180 --> 01:42.370
more content than hundred Muirhead then the stuff is gonna be cut off.

01:42.370 --> 01:48.190
However if I'm saying men height what I'm saying here is that this header should always be hundred new

01:48.190 --> 01:52.830
heights 100 percent of the screen even though the content is not enough.

01:52.840 --> 01:58.300
So that way if I have only three lines of code this is still gonna be a hundred percent and I always

01:58.540 --> 02:02.410
like to use it for my banners and headers and something like that.

02:02.410 --> 02:03.700
Do you have to use them in height.

02:03.700 --> 02:04.780
Can you just use the height.

02:04.780 --> 02:10.120
Yeah probably but I think it's always much more easier to work with men height especially if you know

02:10.120 --> 02:11.320
that with banner.

02:11.320 --> 02:13.540
I don't think you going to place ten paragraphs in there.

02:13.540 --> 02:15.800
Most likely it's going to be three lines of text.

02:16.000 --> 02:16.810
What else I would like.

02:16.810 --> 02:21.890
Well remember we had the background and what's really cool about the background we have the images.

02:21.940 --> 02:23.450
So let me first look for the images.

02:23.450 --> 02:28.300
I'm going to say you and I'm going to be saying two dots because obviously I'm not right now and let

02:28.300 --> 02:29.890
me see where I'm at actually.

02:29.900 --> 02:36.940
So I am in my style's question would be here very simply I'm actually looking on my set of folder.

02:36.940 --> 02:41.920
I did it a little bit differently that's the reason why I'm having two dots since the style is obviously

02:41.920 --> 02:47.160
within the same folder we don't have to do it in general if you're going to obviously place it c assessed

02:47.170 --> 02:50.690
folder and then within the C assessed folder you can have your styles.

02:50.710 --> 02:54.670
This is we're all gonna have to leave the folder but in our case this is going to be the same folder

02:54.670 --> 03:00.430
so my apologies we're just going to images and then I'm looking for this main background image.

03:00.430 --> 03:06.370
The bad boy here and let's write some kind of right away centering positions because we know that we

03:06.370 --> 03:11.860
can write it the long way or we have the nice set of options where we can just write that the image

03:11.860 --> 03:17.290
is gonna be in the centre then we're going to be covering the whole div then we also would like to do

03:17.290 --> 03:21.330
no repetition as well as this is going to be fixed.

03:21.580 --> 03:23.880
So that way we're gonna be able to scroll.

03:23.890 --> 03:32.800
Now I do want to let you write in a way something about fixed with iPhones as far as I remember they

03:32.800 --> 03:39.620
were not supporting this fixed meaning that you're still the image is not gonna be like let's say scroll.

03:39.670 --> 03:45.130
There's not gonna be no parallax effect as well as the image might not look the best.

03:45.130 --> 03:50.170
So that's something you keep you need to keep an eye on where if you will going to be focusing a lot

03:50.230 --> 03:56.800
on the iPhones and let's say it's probably better idea just to not to use it fixed at all just get rid

03:56.800 --> 04:03.970
of it because it's not going to work anyway on the Mac or I'm not sorry Mac on the iPhone again I might

04:03.970 --> 04:10.450
be wrong but as far as I remember that was the case with an iPhone and using the fix what else we have.

04:10.450 --> 04:15.280
Well we obviously have right now the image there is very bright.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.310
So what would be solution for that.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.790
Remember we had a linear gradient.

04:19.210 --> 04:20.360
So why don't we use this.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.370
So linear gradient but we do need to have this comma.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.620
We were going to omit the comma.

04:26.620 --> 04:27.450
This is not going to work.

04:27.880 --> 04:32.970
So there's going to be an error and we're gonna say here that we're going to be looking for our GPA.

04:32.980 --> 04:35.020
Remember our GPA was the black colour.

04:35.170 --> 04:36.670
I'm sorry not black colour.

04:36.660 --> 04:43.130
That was the colour that allows us to have the opacity or the transparency since they are GPA.

04:43.210 --> 04:47.860
Then I'm gonna be looking for the black colour because I have told you black colour because I already

04:47.860 --> 04:48.410
know that.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.530
I would like to have the black colour.

04:50.530 --> 04:52.900
This is gonna be zero point six.

04:52.900 --> 04:54.420
So it's gonna be kind of dark ish.

04:54.910 --> 05:01.550
And then again we do need to have the syntax Where are we having the com and here I'm gonna say again

05:01.610 --> 05:08.680
our GPA then we're gonna look for the same color so we could have technically copied and pasted and

05:08.690 --> 05:10.460
let's say zero point six.

05:10.460 --> 05:16.700
We know that our background or our linear gradient is gonna be going from the top to the bottom but

05:16.700 --> 05:18.260
if you were using the same color.

05:18.260 --> 05:19.520
Doesn't really matter.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.430
So the whole background is gonna look like this.

05:21.860 --> 05:23.300
If you think this is too dark.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.140
No problem.

05:24.140 --> 05:26.060
Just about zero point five.

05:26.060 --> 05:27.840
You think this is still too dark.

05:27.850 --> 05:31.220
I had something less unless you want to be really creative.

05:31.220 --> 05:32.200
Pick another color.

05:32.270 --> 05:33.410
Doesn't really matter.

05:33.410 --> 05:37.010
I would suggest using our GPA because then you can control the possibly.

05:37.190 --> 05:39.560
But it's not really written in stone.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.960
You can really use whatever you'd like.

05:41.990 --> 05:42.620
Awesome.

05:42.620 --> 05:43.510
So we have the header.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.000
What is next on our agenda.

05:46.190 --> 05:47.410
Well we have the banner right.

05:47.750 --> 05:53.920
So maybe within a header we can just say banner and for the banner I would like to place it in the center.

05:53.930 --> 05:56.760
Now when I say banner What do I mean by banner.

05:56.870 --> 06:01.210
I have the header and I have the David Banner banner has all the text.

06:01.340 --> 06:06.810
What I would like to do is set this banner with position absolute right here in the center.

06:06.830 --> 06:11.450
That way I will have my text as well and center how this is gonna work.

06:11.450 --> 06:19.320
Well very simply say banner then we know that we have an option of let's say position absolute position

06:19.340 --> 06:20.160
absolute.

06:20.180 --> 06:23.570
Now this is gonna obviously take it out of the normal flow.

06:23.570 --> 06:27.470
Then we would need to work with the values because if I'm gonna save it nothing is going to change right

06:27.470 --> 06:28.130
now.

06:28.130 --> 06:35.210
And what we are looking for is Trump is going to be 50 percent and left is also going to be 50 percent.

06:35.300 --> 06:41.770
So now we're setting this up relative to how or I can tell you right away that we have missed something.

06:41.840 --> 06:46.440
There's something missing where this is not going to perform exactly like we would want.

06:46.460 --> 06:47.560
So let me say this.

06:47.940 --> 06:53.000
And first of all we obviously see that we would need to transform this because even though this is technically

06:53.000 --> 06:58.880
in the center it is not really in the center at the moment because it still has its own width and height.

06:59.120 --> 07:03.320
There is also an issue because remember with position absolute we were looking for the first parent

07:03.360 --> 07:04.800
with relative.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.590
Otherwise we're going to be setting this relative to the body.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.060
What is the parent.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.910
I believe it was the header.

07:11.910 --> 07:13.610
Do we have the relative.

07:13.610 --> 07:15.640
No I don't think we do so here.

07:15.650 --> 07:17.980
That's right also position and position.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.220
Marcus is gonna be a relative.

07:19.440 --> 07:23.850
So now we're gonna be setting actually this manner relative to this even though right now I'm gonna

07:23.850 --> 07:26.530
say it you'll say well there was no change.

07:26.660 --> 07:26.920
Yeah.

07:26.930 --> 07:32.060
People because we have nothing else in the document but if you're gonna set this up this is not gonna

07:32.070 --> 07:32.930
be the proper way.

07:32.940 --> 07:38.220
So I always make sure that the parent the one that you would want to place it relative to does have

07:38.220 --> 07:42.110
actually this relative position as a value.

07:42.140 --> 07:42.550
Okay.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.590
What else.

07:43.680 --> 07:47.700
Maybe before we work with transformations we can also do this.

07:47.700 --> 07:51.500
We can say text line is gonna be in the center.

07:51.850 --> 07:54.840
So now this text is going to be nicely sitting in the center.

07:54.900 --> 07:58.350
And when I say nicely we still need to do the transformation.

07:58.350 --> 08:00.690
And how was the transformation.

08:00.700 --> 08:05.850
Remember he had transformed property and within the transform property we had translate X translate

08:05.850 --> 08:11.680
y but we also could use both values whenever we're were using the both values.

08:11.700 --> 08:12.810
First one was x.

08:12.810 --> 08:16.400
Second one was y y is the correct answer.

08:16.590 --> 08:20.180
And then we had an option working with percentages.

08:20.310 --> 08:25.530
So if I know that right now this text is sitting with its own with its own height.

08:25.530 --> 08:33.450
Why don't we add 50 percent move to the left because we're going to move basically the half of the value

08:33.540 --> 08:40.740
of the actual banner as well as move it up 50 percent which is gonna be on the y axis.

08:40.740 --> 08:45.060
So I'm gonna say 50 and 50 and booyah.

08:45.060 --> 08:51.210
This is our text exactly in the center where I can say boom or I'm I've been actually trying to come

08:51.210 --> 08:56.610
up with these names because obviously as you're watching 17 hours you are really getting annoyed with

08:56.610 --> 09:04.830
me repeating something so I have to tell you I have been working on researching what I can say whenever

09:04.830 --> 09:08.330
something good happens or something like that where I have come up with.

09:08.340 --> 09:15.570
Well I didn't really come up with but you'll hear me saying Booyah boom more just like that or something

09:15.570 --> 09:16.380
like that.

09:16.800 --> 09:17.670
What else I would like.

09:17.670 --> 09:24.660
Well I think we can go with letter spacing and for the letter spacing people and the variable remember

09:25.120 --> 09:30.440
the letter spacing so why don't we does this out why don't we say a letter spacing property is gonna

09:30.450 --> 09:37.740
have our variable or a variable is gonna be looking like this and we have our letter spacing are some

09:38.100 --> 09:43.710
awesome everything is working really why we have the text align center we have all these things but

09:43.710 --> 09:48.840
now I'd like to start them all bit more I'm going to say banner subtitle here you're gonna be looking

09:48.840 --> 09:57.120
for a sub title that was our class and just a quick side note I know you're probably wondering you're

09:57.120 --> 09:59.950
looking at this and you're saying OK.

09:59.990 --> 10:01.750
This guy doesn't make sense.

10:01.850 --> 10:04.660
He's having the banner then within the banner setting three.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.230
Then why he's adding this class.

10:06.230 --> 10:10.280
If he could have just work with the sentence selectors right.

10:10.280 --> 10:18.010
So you can say something like this can see a banner and I don't know why have all caps but banner that

10:18.050 --> 10:21.580
I'm looking for having one and then I'm gonna be styling it.

10:22.130 --> 10:22.990
Yeah you can do it.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.750
Especially for this project.

10:24.800 --> 10:25.900
No biggie.

10:25.940 --> 10:26.750
Go ahead.

10:26.750 --> 10:32.420
It's no big deal it's not going to change anything later on as your projects are going to be getting

10:32.420 --> 10:33.660
bigger.

10:33.770 --> 10:39.160
You will gonna start reaching out to some kind of methodology as you're working with CSX.

10:39.320 --> 10:46.120
Now what do I mean by methodology were as your project has five pages ten pages 15 pages.

10:46.130 --> 10:48.890
Seventeen hundred elements whatever.

10:49.250 --> 10:52.610
What happens is that using this kind of structure what it means.

10:52.640 --> 10:56.240
Well I'm gonna be setting this up for that my having having one right.

10:56.240 --> 10:59.150
Well technically that would be heading three.

10:59.290 --> 10:59.870
All right.

10:59.870 --> 11:03.520
The subtitle is having three and what happens if you later on changed this.

11:03.530 --> 11:07.430
If you say well it's not gonna be having three it's gonna be heading for this is not going to apply

11:07.430 --> 11:14.660
anymore because now I'm selecting a three as well as it's going to be harder for you to read later on.

11:14.660 --> 11:20.880
Now if you're using classes that way if this class is gonna be used only setting three I know that I'm

11:20.880 --> 11:25.220
working on this class which again in this case might seem a little bit overkill.

11:25.260 --> 11:27.780
You might be like this doesn't make sense.

11:27.780 --> 11:30.560
I mean he has hanging three why he's adding the class.

11:30.720 --> 11:36.090
There's also gonna be a layer on a well I don't know how much we gonna be implementing to tell you honestly

11:36.360 --> 11:39.030
because I haven't come up with the projects.

11:39.120 --> 11:42.240
The ones that I'm rerecording right now but what.

11:42.280 --> 11:45.580
What's gonna happen is you will gonna meet something called Ben.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.300
This is actually spelled like this.

11:47.310 --> 11:55.320
You gonna write Bam where you are working with a specific methodology which uses only the classes which

11:55.380 --> 12:00.450
are not strictly following this because you would be doing like an underline you'd do something like

12:00.450 --> 12:01.500
this but.

12:01.550 --> 12:07.350
And I think that at the moment it might be a little bit too confusing especially for our first project.

12:07.350 --> 12:12.750
So we're kind of cheating all but but I will gonna try to add classes to all my elements.

12:12.750 --> 12:15.850
That way you can at least start getting used to it.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.410
You don't have to do it again.

12:17.460 --> 12:20.060
You can use something like this descendants.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.270
You can even say like this.

12:21.270 --> 12:27.540
It's also gonna work but I do want to let you know that as you're gonna be progressing with scissors

12:27.930 --> 12:32.040
you will gonna start meeting these methods and methodologies.

12:32.130 --> 12:33.510
Now Bam is not the only one.

12:33.510 --> 12:36.540
Don't get me wrong there's all kinds of ways how you can do it.

12:36.540 --> 12:39.840
People use the utility glasses and so forth and so forth.

12:40.260 --> 12:45.870
But long story short that's the reasoning why I'm using the classes and again I'm sorry I went on for

12:45.870 --> 12:52.440
five minutes but I do think that it's important to explain that because what's happened is that some

12:52.440 --> 12:57.230
person asked this in the comments and then I only answer to that person so I might as well cover this

12:57.230 --> 13:02.230
right now so but who's watching this kind of understands the general idea.

13:02.340 --> 13:06.150
Okay enough of me chatting let's add some fun size shall we.

13:07.050 --> 13:08.640
Let's say two or 3 Ms.

13:08.810 --> 13:13.080
So that's gonna be the text there's gonna be a little bit bigger then I would also want to use that

13:13.080 --> 13:18.940
font family remember that's 9 10 11 so font family and then again two dashes and check this out.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.950
Or boom or bull here.

13:21.150 --> 13:25.560
I don't know how we're gonna try to come up with Mother ones throughout the videos just so you don't

13:25.560 --> 13:26.580
get bored.

13:26.580 --> 13:30.660
But what we're having is these slanted text not the one that I'm looking for.

13:31.110 --> 13:36.180
So let me save this and let's say we're all gonna have to read X text is gonna be slanted.

13:36.270 --> 13:37.380
Awesome.

13:37.380 --> 13:38.700
What else I would like.

13:38.700 --> 13:44.070
Well let me walk with color and then let's use the primary color.

13:44.130 --> 13:45.660
What was the primary color.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.120
I believe it was the green one.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.710
And this is where this is really beautiful.

13:49.710 --> 13:54.480
Now you could do something like this you can say the hashtag and it will gonna technically give you

13:54.480 --> 13:55.460
the values.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.300
So it's not like it's the end of the deal.

13:58.320 --> 14:05.070
Again I don't have to every time say six nine F three f but I think it's also a little bit better because

14:05.070 --> 14:10.910
of the simple reason that I can use the primary color and if I change my mind later on and let's say

14:11.040 --> 14:14.820
this is gonna be not f today then I can say change the color.

14:14.820 --> 14:20.730
Now let me change this back because I do want to have but you understand the idea using this variable

14:20.850 --> 14:27.180
allows you not to jump throughout your document and then just like a crazy person keep changing this

14:27.180 --> 14:28.460
in 50 places.

14:28.470 --> 14:34.170
Granted you have options of finding this by let's say command if this is gonna be one of the nifty things

14:34.170 --> 14:38.370
with Visual Studio code where you just type whatever you're looking for and you can change it in all

14:38.370 --> 14:39.450
the places.

14:39.450 --> 14:43.040
But why would you want to do it if you can just use a variable in the first place.

14:43.050 --> 14:46.600
I think this is much more makes a little bit much more sense.

14:46.620 --> 14:51.150
We have the font size we have the font family and we have the color for now this is gonna be it.

14:51.150 --> 14:54.030
However let me add the animation which is gonna be later on.

14:54.030 --> 14:59.520
So there's gonna be calm and just so we remember that we were gonna be adding animation what else we

14:59.520 --> 15:01.200
have while we have the banner tile right.

15:01.200 --> 15:08.400
So we're gonna say manner then we're looking for the title and what I would want for the title let's

15:08.490 --> 15:13.970
add text transformed first of all we would want the uppercase text is gonna be big.

15:14.220 --> 15:20.850
Then we also gonna add a little bit more font size or three point two or three M's color.

15:20.910 --> 15:22.160
Remember we had the white one.

15:22.590 --> 15:30.330
So when we look for the white color Main White is going to be my color name margin Top Notch has a little

15:30.330 --> 15:38.180
bit of margin same margin top is gonna be an unknown let's say 2.5 are Iams.

15:38.240 --> 15:42.790
So there's going to be a little bit of margin as well as let's change the line had a little bit let's

15:42.790 --> 15:45.330
say line is gonna be one point three.

15:45.510 --> 15:46.780
That should do it.

15:46.890 --> 15:51.000
And then again last but not least let's add the comments for animation that we're going to be adding

15:51.000 --> 15:52.770
on so later on.

15:52.770 --> 15:54.940
So there's gonna be animation.

15:54.950 --> 15:55.790
Okay people.

15:55.890 --> 16:03.080
Now we are arrived to the button and for the button what do we have well if I remember correctly it

16:03.080 --> 16:05.830
was the link linked in which timing.

16:06.180 --> 16:11.420
And if you're looking at the link you noticing that you're right we're having this underline we could

16:11.420 --> 16:15.950
technically go to each and every link and add this text underline none.

16:16.060 --> 16:20.730
However why don't we use the fact that we can use with these help or utility closet.

16:20.780 --> 16:26.570
Now what help are utility classes are going to allow us to do is just to set up some general styles

16:27.050 --> 16:31.480
where you don't have to jump back and forth and changing this.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.540
Now what is that going to work.

16:32.540 --> 16:37.100
So let's say I'm going to say for all the links so all the links that are going to be in our project

16:37.520 --> 16:38.650
I'm just gonna give her this.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.070
And the reason for that is very simple.

16:40.070 --> 16:44.450
Well later on we're going to have the nav bar later on I guess we're gonna have some other links so

16:44.450 --> 16:47.490
what is the purpose of jumping all the time and saying this.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.960
Okay so I don't want this tax declaration why don't we set it up for all the links.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.860
I don't want that tax declaration.

16:53.870 --> 16:55.620
What else we're having.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.940
I would want to have some text white class so every time I would want some text white somewhere I'm

17:01.940 --> 17:02.830
just going to skip it.

17:02.830 --> 17:07.140
I'm just gonna say color and now I'm gonna be looking for again var.

17:07.290 --> 17:12.690
And within here I have my main one that's gonna be my answer you tell a class.

17:12.770 --> 17:16.360
I can also do text center so text center.

17:16.400 --> 17:21.590
And again if those of you who are confused just understand that we are creating these classes right

17:21.590 --> 17:27.220
now and I can add these classes all throughout my document and these styles are going to be applied.

17:27.260 --> 17:29.790
That's the general understanding behind this.

17:30.020 --> 17:37.530
And then we have a text center and here let's do text online and we're gonna be using text center.

17:37.880 --> 17:42.110
Again you're not going to be able to see those classes right now because honestly we haven't set it

17:42.110 --> 17:49.790
up I'm in a project as well as you know the last one or one before last we're gonna be primary and that's

17:49.790 --> 17:51.960
gonna be equal to color.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.240
And here I'm gonna be looking.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.830
Remember we had the primary color.

17:55.070 --> 17:59.950
So let me say color for some reason it's not giving me suggestions and now it does.

17:59.960 --> 18:03.160
And I would like to use this primary color me save it.

18:03.320 --> 18:06.330
And this is gonna be my value for primary color.

18:06.380 --> 18:09.590
Here again I'm going to add a comment.

18:09.830 --> 18:11.420
And this is gonna be for a clear fix.

18:11.420 --> 18:12.200
No clear fix.

18:12.200 --> 18:15.470
We're gonna deal later on as we start working with the float.

18:15.470 --> 18:19.890
So for now I don't want to put too much stuff in your head.

18:19.990 --> 18:24.500
You can just say that there will gonna be later on clear fix and you'll see once we start working with

18:24.500 --> 18:27.920
them why we're actually using this for this.

18:27.920 --> 18:31.040
What we had we had something called banner button.

18:31.040 --> 18:37.370
Now within styles again scroll over here with me say right after the banner title we're all gonna have

18:37.490 --> 18:39.650
our main button.

18:39.650 --> 18:42.110
Now I'm saying that our button.

18:42.110 --> 18:44.630
But then the moment I'm also saying main button.

18:44.630 --> 18:46.480
So what will be the difference.

18:46.520 --> 18:47.980
The general idea is very simple.

18:48.020 --> 18:53.390
So I'm going to have some kind of button I will gonna set up some kind of styles for the button.

18:53.430 --> 18:58.040
However because this is gonna be the banner button we're gonna set up another class there is gonna be

18:58.690 --> 19:00.410
our all throughout my document.

19:00.410 --> 19:05.060
We're gonna be able to use this simple main button and how this is gonna work.

19:05.060 --> 19:12.860
Well let's go back and let's say that there's going to be two classes so we can say main button or stall

19:13.280 --> 19:14.200
as well as com.

19:14.270 --> 19:16.670
And now I'm going to be working for the banner button.

19:16.790 --> 19:21.200
Now all the styles that we're gonna be applying for the main button are can be also applied for the

19:21.200 --> 19:24.560
banner button but banner button we're gonna make it bigger.

19:24.590 --> 19:28.680
What styles we're gonna have display in line.

19:28.720 --> 19:34.160
So this is gonna be displayed this in one block just because we would want the browser to respect the

19:34.160 --> 19:37.400
pairings and margins and all that can also do the background.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.160
The background is gonna be primary color.

19:40.170 --> 19:45.110
That's gonna be as you can see now I'm working with my button as well as I would like to start working

19:45.110 --> 19:46.370
with text.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.710
The creation is going to be none.

19:48.710 --> 19:53.020
And this is the case if I already work with all the links I don't have to do it anymore.

19:53.180 --> 19:54.470
So now I can skip it.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.630
That was the reason why we added this for the links.

19:57.650 --> 20:03.360
A lot of cases which you're going to see is as you're working let's say with I don't know headings and

20:03.360 --> 20:03.910
paragraphs.

20:03.920 --> 20:06.080
There's gonna be some general styles.

20:06.140 --> 20:11.120
Again we're not gonna do this in this project but in general that's the reason why we would do that

20:11.970 --> 20:12.890
text.

20:12.900 --> 20:20.630
We can also do text transform is gonna be uppercase so the text is gonna be bigger than what's had some

20:20.630 --> 20:26.120
padding and not page break patting and patting is gonna be the one that's going to be different for

20:26.120 --> 20:29.970
the different ones meaning for the banner button This is gonna be bigger.

20:29.970 --> 20:31.090
So Ms.

20:31.160 --> 20:37.250
One point to Marion that's gonna be the typical padding but since this will all gonna be the banner

20:37.250 --> 20:39.050
button there's gonna be bigger one.

20:39.050 --> 20:40.730
Also I would want to have some color.

20:41.360 --> 20:47.210
So let's say color is gonna be and for some reason again it's not going to give me suggestions which

20:47.210 --> 20:51.460
is a weird mean dark would be my color.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.530
Let's start out.

20:52.550 --> 20:59.540
I would also want to have font weight to be bold on the fond way it is going to be bolder.

20:59.820 --> 21:01.320
And remember the outline.

21:01.360 --> 21:07.530
Remember that nice thing that we had with buttons or not just buttons where we had the outline properly

21:08.030 --> 21:09.740
and let's write outline.

21:09.740 --> 21:13.750
The property is gonna have value zero point to Mariam so the width.

21:13.830 --> 21:16.010
Then what type of outline solid.

21:16.110 --> 21:20.640
And then I'm gonna be looking for my primary color when the moment I'm say it.

21:20.650 --> 21:26.340
Nothing technically is gonna change because right now you just notice that there is this something kind

21:26.340 --> 21:33.440
of around there's a very very thin black line but what I would like to do is use the outline offset.

21:33.540 --> 21:35.660
That's the whole purpose for this.

21:35.700 --> 21:39.260
So here I am with say the offset is going to be something like four pixels.

21:39.390 --> 21:42.300
And now this looks obviously much more nicer.

21:42.300 --> 21:48.630
Also it can do cursor and we're going to be looking for the pointer and it was save it like this here

21:49.170 --> 21:54.930
as well as we would want to add a little bit transition because I would want to hover this and as I'm

21:54.930 --> 21:59.350
hovering I would like to have let's say different color.

21:59.400 --> 22:07.860
But maybe before we do that and let's add margin top and let's say that this wood is gonna be two our

22:07.960 --> 22:16.170
times something like this and then let's start working with actually our transitions or hovering effect

22:16.620 --> 22:18.670
let's say for the main button.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.820
So main beat in as I'm hovering.

22:21.960 --> 22:27.270
Something should happen and you know what I actually would want to set up for both of them on the same

22:27.270 --> 22:31.400
main button as well as hover as well as banner button.

22:31.440 --> 22:35.510
So I'm going to say Vanna Beatty and also hover.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.250
So as we're hovering over both of them we would want to change them.

22:39.290 --> 22:39.970
Now what.

22:39.970 --> 22:45.320
That something is gonna be going to color is going to be changed so the color is going to change to

22:45.340 --> 22:46.730
main white.

22:46.770 --> 22:46.980
Yeah.

22:47.020 --> 22:52.000
Let me get a suggestion and I'll be getting mine white as I'm hovering.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.350
No I What's what's gonna happen.

22:53.500 --> 22:58.200
But the change happens instantly as well as I would like to change the opacity.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.580
Two zero point seven.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.320
So this is gonna become a little bit more transparent.

23:04.330 --> 23:04.650
Mm hmm.

23:04.820 --> 23:09.070
But here's the thing I would want this change to happen over time.

23:09.110 --> 23:15.230
And remember for that we had transition property and for transition what we had the values.

23:15.230 --> 23:16.390
Mm hmm.

23:16.490 --> 23:20.100
Let me remember Then we set this up in the variables.

23:20.300 --> 23:22.100
So we had what kind of property.

23:22.160 --> 23:26.850
I'm just gonna go with all the properties along zero point three and then easy now.

23:26.990 --> 23:32.300
So the way they transition is gonna take place in this case I can head over back and I can say again

23:32.300 --> 23:38.210
I'm going to be selecting and I would like to work with the main transition and that would be my basic

23:38.210 --> 23:39.140
setup.

23:39.140 --> 23:40.740
We are almost done.

23:40.900 --> 23:47.480
We're almost done with the section but remember that I wanted to work also with the fact that not only

23:47.480 --> 23:51.950
this is gonna be the banner button but the manor button is gonna be a little bit bigger.

23:52.010 --> 23:58.160
What I can do is I can say okay I had all the styles for both of them I had main button banner button

23:58.610 --> 24:07.900
having the same styles but here I'm going to say banner meet n so specifically just for the banner button

24:08.470 --> 24:12.560
I'm going to work with padding where I'm going to say zero point two arms.

24:12.610 --> 24:19.120
So the padding is going to be bigger as well as our arms one point five left and right top bottom should

24:19.120 --> 24:21.380
be bigger and left and right and it's gonna be bigger.

24:21.390 --> 24:24.580
Now this case this banner button is gonna be bigger.

24:24.580 --> 24:30.730
Also we're gonna add here in this specific animation in the next video I believe some when say animation

24:30.730 --> 24:35.010
is gonna be also for this banner button and that's not what I wanted to do.

24:35.080 --> 24:41.380
So let me get this back as well as all throughout the document we will gonna use this main button.

24:41.680 --> 24:46.960
So for all the buttons that are gonna be smaller we're gonna use this main button we already set it

24:46.960 --> 24:54.100
up but just for the banner we add a little bit more padding because we would want it to be looking a

24:54.100 --> 24:55.650
little bit more presentable.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.470
Let's see what we're going to have for now.

24:57.530 --> 25:00.030
And I think our banner looks just awesome.

25:00.040 --> 25:04.960
We can also test it out maybe on a small screen size so let's say how this is going to look like as

25:04.960 --> 25:05.680
I'm going down.

25:05.680 --> 25:08.090
I think this is looks perfect.

25:08.260 --> 25:16.390
And we have successfully added our banner within the header and now maybe let's cover quickly on the

25:16.390 --> 25:17.690
animations insists.
