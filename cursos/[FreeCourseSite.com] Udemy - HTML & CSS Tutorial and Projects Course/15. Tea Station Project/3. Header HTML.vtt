WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:00.810
Brilliant.

00:00.810 --> 00:05.490
We have our setup so why don't we get busy coding and the first thing that we're going to be working

00:05.490 --> 00:13.170
on is gonna be this header section where first we're gonna set up Operation AML with this subtitle title

00:13.620 --> 00:15.690
as well as the button.

00:15.900 --> 00:19.700
Obviously if we know what we're going to be doing can just close this welcome here.

00:19.710 --> 00:23.170
We're gonna leave these two tabs open just because we're gonna be working on them.

00:23.550 --> 00:26.850
However I going to close the sidebar because I think that way.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.340
We for sure have a little bit more real estate and in my opinion that can give us a little bit more

00:32.340 --> 00:34.140
understanding what we're doing here.

00:34.150 --> 00:39.320
I'd like to start very very simply by getting rid of everything that we wrote in the last video.

00:39.420 --> 00:40.230
Let's save this.

00:40.230 --> 00:43.290
And sure enough now I don't see this annoying text.

00:43.320 --> 00:43.950
What else.

00:44.020 --> 00:47.910
Now let's start by acting comments or adding comments.

00:47.910 --> 00:52.650
The reason for these comments is later on we're going to work on a map bar as well as on this button.

00:53.340 --> 00:58.200
Technically there is no reasoning to put it place it here and not top the now bar award.

00:58.210 --> 01:03.180
Now mutton because we're gonna be using position fixed so this could be all the way in the bottom somewhere

01:03.180 --> 01:04.350
in the middle doesn't really matter.

01:04.350 --> 01:08.620
But just to stay consistent meaning there's going to be a button and a number.

01:08.700 --> 01:12.090
Why don't we first create the comments and they're all gonna be there.

01:12.090 --> 01:13.490
So I'm going to write this now.

01:13.500 --> 01:17.480
Button as well as I would like to right now.

01:17.560 --> 01:23.580
So this is going to be nav bar and then we're gonna write comments for that are we all gonna do the

01:23.580 --> 01:26.580
NAV button and now bar all the way at the end.

01:26.580 --> 01:31.970
Just because I would like to get the rest when the project is under way but just so we know where we're

01:31.980 --> 01:36.630
going to replacing them we're gonna have these coming and then I'm gonna say here that we're gonna be

01:36.630 --> 01:38.910
working on a header and right away.

01:38.910 --> 01:45.480
I don't know this is real again really opinionated but I like the fact that the end of header so that

01:45.480 --> 01:51.480
way I can always know that okay within these comments I have my header section where I have my about

01:51.480 --> 01:53.080
section or whatever.

01:53.090 --> 01:55.590
Yada yada yada ja section.

01:55.590 --> 02:00.300
And that way whenever I want to copy and paste something I can just grab from one comment to the other

02:00.300 --> 02:02.570
one is that something you need to do.

02:02.610 --> 02:05.170
Now you can avoid the comments altogether.

02:05.350 --> 02:07.530
Is that is something that's helped me.

02:07.530 --> 02:08.230
Yeah it does.

02:08.230 --> 02:09.570
So that's the reason why I'm here.

02:10.140 --> 02:14.430
Let's start by a simple header element and then I would like to add some class.

02:14.460 --> 02:16.740
Now the class is going to be very straightforward.

02:16.830 --> 02:20.450
I'm just going to give it this header element a glass of header letter.

02:20.880 --> 02:25.410
Then within the header I'm gonna place some Dave where the class of manner and we already know that

02:25.410 --> 02:30.480
we damn it we just need to write the class name and if we add to that now we're gonna be getting the

02:30.490 --> 02:33.620
div with our class of batter.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.130
Right what else.

02:35.220 --> 02:39.900
Let's say there's going to be hitting three and you can see that I messed up a little bit.

02:39.900 --> 02:44.670
I could have just write down or subtitle and that would be my class.

02:44.880 --> 02:50.990
And then what kind of text we would like to write within the setting three I believe we said over one

02:51.000 --> 02:54.050
hundred flavours of tea.

02:54.060 --> 03:04.010
Now let me go back and let's say over one hundred or million flavours of tea.

03:04.020 --> 03:05.770
OK well let me know that.

03:05.820 --> 03:06.480
I don't know.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.100
Probably said it and then I wrote it.

03:08.130 --> 03:12.060
But let's just deal with the tea team having three good.

03:12.060 --> 03:13.770
Awesome drum roll please.

03:13.770 --> 03:16.530
We have our having three within the heading One.

03:16.560 --> 03:24.470
Let me maybe add the right away class and let's say banner call this banner title and then for the battle

03:24.480 --> 03:33.100
title that's right speciality crafted crafty speciality graph third and we're going to call this tea.

03:33.130 --> 03:39.670
Now let me say it and now I have my mining three as well as the heading One that's gonna be the text.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.200
What else.

03:40.200 --> 03:46.350
Well we have the link we have this bad boy here with an explorer obviously we haven't created the pages

03:46.350 --> 03:52.680
yet on the sidebar we have only indexation email but later on it's kind of understanding that we're

03:52.680 --> 03:58.920
going to be creating rest of the pages so this will gonna be link I'm going to say link and for the

03:58.920 --> 04:03.210
link let's say a trip is gonna go to skills I should email again.

04:03.270 --> 04:10.130
Page does not exist at the moment but it will run and we can right away maybe add some class let's say

04:10.130 --> 04:13.630
a class is going to be banner but on.

04:13.710 --> 04:21.470
So banner dash beat are what is gonna be within the link let's write X law so that should be our basic

04:21.720 --> 04:27.480
email setup once we have the setup we can head over to see this and start styling this bad boy.
