WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:00.860
OK.

00:00.960 --> 00:01.500
Awesome.

00:01.500 --> 00:03.080
We have our browser now.

00:03.630 --> 00:05.850
Well I believe I told you that we need it.

00:05.850 --> 00:12.780
Also a text that are so we can put our good old friend Google right now already since it is on our machine

00:13.440 --> 00:16.920
to use and we can just search for the Visual Studio code.

00:17.230 --> 00:18.870
Again same old spiel.

00:19.030 --> 00:20.910
Can just say Visual Studio code.

00:20.910 --> 00:22.560
Well we're not going to be looking for a logo.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.420
We're going to be looking for a visual studio called.

00:25.490 --> 00:27.950
As this is going to be the first link that pops up.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.110
So again bravely without hesitation we just had over here.

00:32.110 --> 00:35.590
And as you can see it tells me right away what operating system are man.

00:36.060 --> 00:38.960
And it says well here is the download buddy.

00:38.960 --> 00:39.290
OK.

00:39.310 --> 00:40.860
So I'm just gonna click it over here.

00:40.890 --> 00:43.020
So this is gonna start my download again.

00:43.140 --> 00:48.000
The installation package is gonna be available to us in a second and again obviously if you're using

00:48.000 --> 00:53.850
different operating system they will going to provide you with a proper installation package for your

00:53.850 --> 00:55.470
operating system.

00:55.470 --> 01:00.450
Now here you can see that this would be my download so I can just open it over here and once I have

01:00.450 --> 01:04.630
it right next to Google Chrome I have my visual studio code.

01:04.650 --> 01:10.080
Now again the same old spiel I would just need to grab this and just drag and drop it in my applications

01:10.530 --> 01:13.230
so I'm done with getting my visual studio code.

01:13.270 --> 01:19.410
And again the same thing with any applications out first find the Visual Studio code and I'm going to

01:19.410 --> 01:20.800
open up over here.

01:20.820 --> 01:23.130
Now let me first of all maybe close this.

01:23.130 --> 01:24.980
I don't need the actual browser open.

01:25.050 --> 01:27.890
And again it will going to ask you Are you okay with this.

01:27.900 --> 01:30.290
Well obviously we are since we want to work with this.

01:30.660 --> 01:34.070
And before we do anything again I'm going to keep this in the dark.

01:34.080 --> 01:37.060
I'm just gonna say options and keep it in the dark.

01:37.080 --> 01:41.940
Now once we open up the Visual Studio code and you know what let me just make this bigger so it's all

01:41.940 --> 01:43.170
a bit easier to see.

01:43.380 --> 01:49.260
We all got to be met by welcoming string my own welcoming screen we have few options we can open up

01:49.260 --> 01:53.590
new file in the folder and as you can see we can also customize this.

01:53.820 --> 01:59.100
Now this is gonna be the first time when you are actually downloading Visual Studio code obviously all

01:59.100 --> 02:01.320
not gonna have the recent project.

02:01.320 --> 02:08.280
The only reason I do is because I had to reinstall the Visual Studio code just so we can go through

02:08.280 --> 02:09.930
all the steps together.

02:09.990 --> 02:15.540
Now I'm not going to spend tons of times right now on Visual Studio code because I would like to get

02:15.540 --> 02:18.990
us up and running and actually create our first webpage.

02:19.020 --> 02:21.500
I do want to show you know the general workspace.

02:21.510 --> 02:25.590
So let me close this personal and as you notice these icons right.

02:26.040 --> 02:30.840
So we have at the very top this is where we're gonna be working with our files.

02:30.900 --> 02:36.900
So as you notice I'm opening this up and this is going to be the space where all gonna be doing most

02:36.900 --> 02:37.700
of our work.

02:37.800 --> 02:43.680
In fact all the woodwork and this would be our file structure so whatever that is going to be folders

02:43.680 --> 02:46.130
files or images or anything like that.

02:46.290 --> 02:50.250
This is gonna be within this tab all here within the sidebar.

02:50.250 --> 02:54.360
Now next we have few other things few other icons that we're not going to use right now.

02:54.780 --> 03:01.020
Let's say search throughout documents and we also have for the source control which will we get as well

03:01.020 --> 03:02.010
as debugging.

03:02.010 --> 03:06.810
Now again we're not gonna cover them right now because we're not going to use them or they will gonna

03:06.810 --> 03:12.570
be something useful which is extensions meaning with every text that you basically have capabilities

03:12.900 --> 03:20.040
of adding more features to a text header and we're gonna do that actually in a second but for now just

03:20.040 --> 03:24.120
remember that these would be basically the extensions that you have available.

03:24.120 --> 03:30.020
So as you can see here recommended but for now you shouldn't have any extensions installed if you obviously

03:30.030 --> 03:32.460
just downloaded the Visual Studio code.

03:32.520 --> 03:37.530
Now if you'd like to search for extension again you can just type whatever extension we're looking for.

03:37.710 --> 03:42.760
And obviously this is not going to come up with anything but let's say we're going say javascript and

03:42.780 --> 03:45.780
this is going to bring me all kinds of extensions.

03:45.840 --> 03:51.690
Now last but not least regarding Visual Studio code something that will gonna be an important especially

03:51.690 --> 03:56.580
later on as we're gonna be working a little more and more with Visual Studio code.

03:56.610 --> 03:57.700
It's the settings.

03:57.840 --> 04:04.560
So if you click on this cog all the way in the bottom notice it's gonna give us settings now settings

04:04.560 --> 04:06.960
allow us to customize the works.

04:07.710 --> 04:13.750
So let's say we want a bigger font size so I could change this from 12 to let's say 22.

04:13.830 --> 04:19.710
If I would want a different tab size again we can just change this around and what I'm trying to tell

04:19.710 --> 04:23.820
you is that has the Morial gonna be working with your actual texture.

04:24.030 --> 04:28.950
There's going to be times when you're changing your settings to adjust whether that's gonna be an extension

04:29.310 --> 04:31.990
or just or your personal preference.

04:32.010 --> 04:35.290
Now also the settings are in fact in adjacent object.

04:35.430 --> 04:40.560
So this would be a basically graphical interface how we can work when the settings are worried let's

04:40.560 --> 04:45.350
say I'm going to change the setting from font size let's say I'm gonna say that this is gonna be twenty

04:45.350 --> 04:51.900
two and once I make the change the changes are gonna be automatically saved however there is also an

04:51.900 --> 04:57.050
option for the adjacent object and within Jay some object notice something interesting.

04:57.060 --> 05:02.600
So now these would be my settings as you notice I change it from whatever it was initially to let's

05:02.600 --> 05:04.300
say 22 so far.

05:04.310 --> 05:05.480
One add something else.

05:05.480 --> 05:09.820
I'm going to say I don't know that there's a setting for the font is going to be something like 30.

05:09.860 --> 05:12.120
Now in this case I would need to save it.

05:12.200 --> 05:18.110
So I have few options either I can go here and just look for a file and check this out that I can actually

05:18.110 --> 05:24.800
save it or I would have to use the shortcut and that would be command and ask again if you're working

05:24.800 --> 05:30.050
on Windows that probably would be control and as but since this is the Mac I'm just going to say that

05:30.500 --> 05:31.750
this would be commanded.

05:32.090 --> 05:37.670
Now in my case again I'm going to delete this because I would like to come back to it within a few videos

05:38.090 --> 05:40.900
whenever we're going to make our first web page already.

05:41.270 --> 05:47.270
But just to let you know that this is where the settings would be located for the Visual Studio called.
